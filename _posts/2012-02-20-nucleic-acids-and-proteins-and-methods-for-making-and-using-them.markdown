Environmental pollutants consist of a large quantity and variety of chemicals many of these are toxic environmental hazards that were designated in 1979 as priority pollutants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Microbial and enzymatic biodegradation is one method for the elimination of these pollutants. Accordingly methods have been designed to treat commercial wastes and to bioremediate polluted environments via microbial and related enzymatic processes. Unfortunately many chemical pollutants are either resistant to microbial degradation or are toxic to potential microbial degraders when present in high concentrations and certain combinations.

Endoglucanases of the invention can be used in the food industry for baking and fruit and vegetable processing breakdown of agricultural waste in the manufacture of animal feed in pulp and paper production textile manufacture and household and industrial cleaning agents. Endoglucanases are produced by fungi and bacteria.

Beta glucans are major non starch polysaccharides of cereals. The glucan content can vary significantly depending on variety and growth conditions. The physicochemical properties of this polysaccharide are such that it gives rise to viscous solutions or even gels under oxidative conditions. In addition glucans have high water binding capacity. All of these characteristics present problems for several industries including brewing baking animal nutrition. In brewing applications the presence of glucan results in wort filterability and haze formation issues. In baking applications especially for cookies and crackers glucans can create sticky doughs that are difficult to machine and reduce biscuit size. In addition this carbohydrate is implicated in rapid rehydration of the baked product resulting in loss of crispiness and reduced shelf life. For monogastric animal feed applications with cereal diets beta glucan is a contributing factor to viscosity of gut contents and thereby adversely affects the digestibility of the feed and animal growth rate. For ruminant animals these beta glucans represent substantial components of fiber intake and more complete digestion of glucans would facilitate higher feed conversion efficiencies. It is desirable for animal feed endoglucanases to be active in the animal stomach.

Endoglucanases of the invention can be used in the digestion of cellulose a beta 1 4 linked glucan found in all plant material. Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide in nature.

These are highly attractive as they lead to the formation of a single enantiomeric diol from a racemic oxirane.

Microsomal epoxide hydrolases are biotransformation enzymes that catalyze the conversion of a broad array of xenobiotic epoxide substrates to more polar diol metabolites see e.g. Omiecinski 2000 Toxicol. Lett. 112 113 365 370. Microsomal epoxide hydrolases catalyze the addition of water to epoxides in a two step reaction involving initial attack of an active site carboxylate on the oxirane to give an ester intermediate followed by hydrolysis of the ester. Soluble epoxide hydrolase play a role in the biosynthesis of inflammation mediators.

Oils and fats an important renewable raw material for the chemical industry. They are available in large quantities from the processing of oilseeds from plants like rice bran oil rapeseed canola sunflower olive palm or soy. Other sources of valuable oils and fats include fish restaurant waste and rendered animal fats. These fats and oils are a mixture of triglycerides or lipids i.e. fatty acids FAs esterified on a glycerol scaffold. Each oil or fat contains a wide variety of different lipid structures defined by the FA content and their regiochemical distribution on the glycerol backbone. These properties of the individual lipids determine the physical properties of the pure triglyceride. Hence the triglyceride content of a fat or oil to a large extent determines the physical chemical and biological properties of the oil. The value of lipids increases greatly as a function of their purity. High purity can be achieved by fractional chromatography or distillation separating the desired triglyceride from the mixed background of the fat or oil source. However this is costly and yields are often limited by the low levels at which the triglyceride occurs naturally. In addition the purity of the product is often compromised by the presence of many structurally and physically or chemically similar triglycerides in the oil.

An alternative to purifying triglycerides or other lipids from a natural source is to synthesize the lipids. The products of such processes are called structured lipids because they contain a defined set of fatty acids distributed in a defined manner on the glycerol backbone. The value of lipids also increases greatly by controlling the fatty acid content and distribution within the lipid. Lipases can be used to affect such control.

Phospholipases are enzymes that hydrolyze the ester bonds of phospholipids. Corresponding to their importance in the metabolism of phospholipids these enzymes are widespread among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The phospholipases affect the metabolism construction and reorganization of biological membranes and are involved in signal cascades. Several types of phospholipases are known which differ in their specificity according to the position of the bond attacked in the phospholipid molecule. Phospholipase A1 PLA1 removes the 1 position fatty acid to produce free fatty acid and 1 lyso 2 acylphospholipid. Phospholipase A2 PLA2 removes the 2 position fatty acid to produce free fatty acid and 1 acyl 2 lysophospholipid. PLA1 and PLA2 enzymes can be intra or extra cellular membrane bound or soluble. Intracellular PLA2 is found in almost every mammalian cell. Phospholipase C PLC removes the phosphate moiety to produce 1 2 diacylglycerol and phospho base. Phospholipase D PLD produces 1 2 diacylglycerophosphate and base group. PLC and PLD are important in cell function and signaling. Patatins are another type of phospholipase thought to work as a PLA.

In general enzymes including hydrolases such as esterases lipases and proteases are active over a narrow range of environmental conditions temperature pH etc. and many are highly specific for particular substrates. The narrow range of activity for a given enzyme limits its applicability and creates a need for a selection of enzymes that a have similar activities but are active under different conditions or b have different substrates. For instance an enzyme capable of catalyzing a reaction at 50 C. may be so inefficient at 35 C. that its use at the lower temperature will not be feasible. For this reason laundry detergents generally contain a selection of proteolytic enzymes e.g. polypeptides of the invention allowing the detergent to be used over a broad range of wash temperature and pH. In view of the specificity of enzymes and the growing use of hydrolases in industry research and medicine there is an ongoing need in the art for new enzymes and new enzyme inhibitors.

Phosphatases are a group of enzymes that remove phosphate groups from organophosphate ester compounds. There are numerous phosphatases including alkaline phosphatases phosphodiesterases and phytases.

Alkaline phosphatases are widely distributed enzymes and are composed of a group of enzymes which hydrolyze organic phosphate ester bonds at alkaline pH.

Phosphodiesterases are capable of hydrolyzing nucleic acids by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bridges of DNA and RNA. The classification of phosphodiesterases depends upon which side of the phosphodiester bridge is attacked. The 3 enzymes specifically hydrolyze the ester linkage between the 3 carbon and the phosphoric group whereas the 5 enzymes hydrolyze the ester linkage between the phosphoric group and the 5 carbon of the phosphodiester bridge. The best known of the class 3 enzymes is a phosphodiesterase from the venom of the rattlesnake or from a rustle s viper which hydrolyses all the 3 bonds in either RNA or DNA liberating nearly all the nucleotide units as nucleotide 5 phosphates. This enzyme requires a free 3 hydroxyl group on the terminal nucleotide residue and proceeds stepwise from that end of the polynucleotide chain. This enzyme and all other nucleases which attack only at the ends of the polynucleotide chains are called exonucleases. The 5 enzymes are represented by a phosphodiesterase from bovine spleen also an exonuclease which hydrolyses all the 5 linkages of both DNA and RNA and thus liberates only nucleoside 3 phosphates. It begins its attack at the end of the chain having a free 3 hydroxyl group.

Use of phytase as a feed additive enables the animal to metabolize a larger degree of its cereal feed s natural mineral content thereby reducing or altogether eliminating the need for synthetic phosphorus additives. More important than the reduced need for phosphorus additives is the corresponding reduction of phosphorus in pig and chicken waste. Many European countries severely limit the amount of manure that can be spread per acre due to concerns regarding phosphorus contamination of ground water.

Several types of phospholipases are known which differ in their specificity according to the position of the bond attacked in the phospholipid molecule. Phospholipase A1 PLA1 removes the 1 position fatty acid to produce free fatty acid and 1 lyso 2 acylphospholipid. Phospholipase A2 PLA2 removes the 2 position fatty acid to produce free fatty acid and 1 acyl 2 lysophospholipid. PLA1 and PLA2 enzymes can be intra or extra cellular membrane bound or soluble. Intracellular PLA2 is found in almost every mammalian cell. Phospholipase C PLC removes the phosphate moiety to produce 1 2 diacylglycerol and phospho base. Phospholipase D PLD produces 1 2 diacylglycerophosphate and base group. PLC and PLD are important in cell function and signaling. PLD had been the dominant phospholipase in biocatalysis. Patatins are another type of phospholipase thought to work as a PLA.

Conversion of phytate to inositol and inorganic phosphorous can be catalyzed by phytase enzymes. Phytases such as phytase EC 3.1.3.8 are capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of myo inositol hexaphosphate to D myo inositol 1 2 4 5 6 pentaphosphate and orthophosphate. Other phytases hydrolyze inositol pentaphosphate to tetra tri and lower phosphates. Acid phosphatases are enzymes that catalytically hydrolyze a wide variety of phosphate esters. For example EC 3.1.3.2 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of orthophosphoric monoesters to orthophosphate products.

Phytases of the invention can be used in producing phytase as a feed additive e.g. for monogastric animals fish poultry ruminants and other non ruminants. Phytases of the invention can also be used for producing animal feed from certain industrial processes e.g. wheat and corn waste products.

Proteases of the invention can be carbonyl hydrolases which act to cleave peptide bonds of proteins or peptides. Proteolytic enzymes are ubiquitous in occurrence found in all living organisms and are essential for cell growth and differentiation. The extracellular proteases are of commercial value and find multiple applications in various industrial sectors. Industrial applications of proteases include food processing brewing alcohol production peptide synthesis enantioselectivity hide preparation in the leather industry waste management and animal degradation silver recovery in the photographic industry medical treatment silk degumming biofilm degradation biomass conversion to ethanol biodefense antimicrobial agents and disinfectants personal care and cosmetics biotech reagents and in increasing starch yield from corn wet milling. Additionally proteases are important components of laundry detergents and other products. Within biological research proteases are used in purification processes to degrade unwanted proteins. It is often desirable to employ proteases of low specificity or mixtures of more specific proteases to obtain the necessary degree of degradation.

Proteases are classified according to their catalytic mechanisms. The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology IUBMB recognizes four mechanistic classes 1 the serine proteases 2 the cysteine proteases 3 the aspartic proteases and 4 the metalloproteases. In addition the IUBMB recognizes a class of endopeptidases oligopeptidases of unknown catalytic mechanism. The serine proteases have alkaline pH optima the metalloproteases are optimally active around neutrality and the cysteine and aspartic enzymes have acidic pH optima. Serine proteases class comprises two distinct families the chymotrypsin family which includes the mammalian enzymes such as chymotrypsin trypsin elastase or kallikrein and the subtilisin family which include the bacterial enzymes such as subtilisin. Serine proteases are used for a variety of industrial purposes such as laundry detergents to aid in the removal of proteinaceous stains. In the food processing industry serine proteases are used to produce protein rich concentrates from fish and livestock and in the preparation of dairy products.

In one aspect the invention provides xylanases polynucleotides encoding them and methods of making and using these polynucleotides and polypeptides. In one aspect the invention is directed to polypeptides e.g. enzymes having a xylanase activity including thermostable and thermotolerant xylanase activity and polynucleotides encoding these enzymes and making and using these polynucleotides and polypeptides.

Xylanases e.g. endo 1 4 beta xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 of the invention can hydrolyze internal 1 4 xylosidic linkages in xylan to produce smaller molecular weight xylose and xylo oligomers. Xylans are polysaccharides formed from 1 4 glycoside linked D xylopyranoses. Xylanases of the invention are of considerable commercial value being used in the food industry for baking and fruit and vegetable processing breakdown of agricultural waste in the manufacture of animal feed and in pulp and paper production.

Arabinoxylanase are major non starch polysaccharides of cereals representing 2.5 7.1 w w depending on variety and growth conditions. The physicochemical properties of this polysaccharide are such that it gives rise to viscous solutions or even gels under oxidative conditions. In addition arabinoxylans have high water binding capacity and may have a role in protein foam stability. All of these characteristics present problems for several industries including brewing baking animal nutrition and paper manufacturing. In brewing applications the presence of xylan results in wort filterability and haze formation issues. In baking applications especially for cookies and crackers these arabinoxylans create sticky doughs that are difficult to machine and reduce biscuit size. In addition this carbohydrate is implicated in rapid rehydration of the baked product resulting in loss of crispiness and reduced shelf life. For monogastric animal feed applications with cereal diets arabinoxylan is a major contributing factor to viscosity of gut contents and thereby adversely affects the digestibility of the feed and animal growth rate. For ruminant animals these polysaccharides represent substantial components of fiber intake and more complete digestion of arabinoxylans would facilitate higher feed conversion efficiencies.

Xylanases are currently used as additives dough conditioners in dough processing for the hydrolysis of water soluble arabinoxylan. In baking applications especially for cookies and crackers arabinoxylan creates sticky doughs that are difficult to machine and reduce biscuit size. In addition this carbohydrate is implicated in rapid rehydration of the baked product resulting in loss of crispiness and reduced shelf life.

The enhancement of xylan digestion in animal feed may improve the availability and digestibility of valuable carbohydrate and protein feed nutrients. For monogastric animal feed applications with cereal diets arabinoxylan is a major contributing factor to viscosity of gut contents and thereby adversely affects the digestibility of the feed and animal growth rate. For ruminant animals these polysaccharides represent substantial components of fiber intake and more complete digestion would facilitate higher feed conversion efficiencies. It is desirable for animal feed xylanases to be active in the animal stomach. This requires a feed enzyme to have high activity at 37 C. and at low pH for monogastrics pH 2 4 and near neutral pH for ruminants pH 6.5 7 . The enzyme should also possess resistance to animal gut xylanases and stability at the higher temperatures involved in feed pelleting. As such there is a need in the art for xylanase feed additives for monogastric feed with high specific activity activity at 35 40 C. and pH 2 4 half life greater than 30 minutes in SGF and a half life 5 minutes at 85 C. in formulated state. For ruminant feed there is a need for xylanase feed additives that have a high specific activity activity at 35 40 C. and pH 6.5 7.0 half life greater than 30 minutes in SRF and stability as a concentrated dry powder.

In one aspect the xylanases of the invention are also used in improving the quality and quantity of milk protein production in lactating cows increasing the amount of soluble saccharides in the stomach and small intestine of pigs improving late egg production efficiency and egg yields in hens. Additionally xylanases of the inventions can be used in biobleaching and treatment of chemical pulps biobleaching and treatment of wood or paper pulps in reducing lignin in wood and modifying wood as feed additives and or supplements or in manufacturing cellulose solutions. Detergent compositions comprising xylanases of the invention are used for fruit vegetables and or mud and clay compounds.

In another aspect xylanases of the invention can be used in compositions for the treatments and or prophylaxis of coccidiosis. In yet another aspect xylanases of the invention can be used in the production of water soluble dietary fiber in improving the filterability separation and production of starch the beverage industry in improving filterability of wort or beer in reducing viscosity of plant material or in increasing viscosity or gel strength of food products such as jam marmalade jelly juice paste soup salsa etc. Xylanases of the invention may also be used in hydrolysis of hemicellulose for which it is selective particularly in the presence of cellulose. In addition xylanases of the invention can also be used in the production of ethanol in transformation of a microbe that produces ethanol in production of oenological tannins and enzymatic composition in stimulating the natural defenses of plants in production of sugars from hemicellulose substrates in the cleaning of fruit vegetables mud or clay containing soils in cleaning beer filtration membranes and in killing or inhibiting microbial cells.

In other aspects the polypeptides of the invention can be immobilized on a solid support prior to use in the methods of the invention. Methods for immobilizing enzymes on solid supports are commonly known in the art for example J. Mol. Cat. B Enzymatic 6 1999 29 39 Chivata et al. Biocatalysis Immobilized cells and enzymes J. Mol. Cat. 37 1986 1 24 Sharma et al. Immobilized Biomaterials Techniques and Applications Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 21 1982 837 54 Laskin Ed. Enzymes and Immobilized Cells in Biotechnology.

A coding sequence of or a sequence encodes a particular polypeptide or protein is a nucleic acid sequence which is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide or protein when placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences.

A promoter sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence when RNA polymerase which initiates transcription at the promoter will transcribe the coding sequence into mRNA.

The phrase substantially identical in the context of two nucleic acids or polypeptides refers to two or more sequences that have e.g. at least about 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or more nucleotide or amino acid residue sequence identity when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence as measured using one of the known sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. In alternative aspects the substantial identity exists over a region of at least about 100 or more residues and most commonly the sequences are substantially identical over at least about 150 to 200 or more residues. In some aspects the sequences are substantially identical over the entire length of the coding regions.

Additionally a substantially identical amino acid sequence is a sequence that differs from a reference sequence by one or more conservative or non conservative amino acid substitutions deletions or insertions. In one aspect the substitution occurs at a site that is not the active site of the molecule or alternatively the substitution occurs at a site that is the active site of the molecule provided that the polypeptide essentially retains its functional enzymatic properties. A conservative amino acid substitution for example substitutes one amino acid for another of the same class e.g. substitution of one hydrophobic amino acid such as isoleucine valine leucine or methionine for another or substitution of one polar amino acid for another such as substitution of arginine for lysine glutamic acid for aspartic acid or glutamine for asparagine . One or more amino acids can be deleted for example from a polypeptide resulting in modification of the structure of the polypeptide without significantly altering its biological activity. For example amino or carboxyl terminal amino acids that are not required for a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein biological activity can be removed. Modified polypeptide sequences of the invention can be assayed for enzyme structural or binding activity by any number of methods including contacting the modified polypeptide sequence with a substrate and determining whether the modified polypeptide decreases the amount of specific substrate in the assay or increases the bioproducts of the reaction of a functional polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein with the substrate. Assays for enzyme activity are well known in the art.

 Fragments as used herein are a portion of a naturally occurring protein which can exist in at least two different conformations. Fragments can have the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring protein. Fragments which have different three dimensional structures as the naturally occurring protein are also included. An example of this is a pro form molecule such as a low activity proprotein that can be modified by cleavage to produce a mature enzyme with significantly higher activity.

The term variant refers to polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention modified at one or more base pairs codons introns exons or amino acid residues respectively yet still retain the biological activity of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention.

In one aspect the invention provides nucleic acids and the polypeptides encoded by them with a common novelty in that they are derived from a common source e.g. an environmental or a bacterial source.

In practicing the methods of the invention homologous genes can be modified by manipulating a template nucleic acid as described herein. The invention can be practiced in conjunction with any method or protocol or device known in the art which are well described in the scientific and patent literature.

The phrases nucleic acid or nucleic acid sequence as used herein refer to an oligonucleotide nucleotide polynucleotide or to a fragment of any of these to DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic origin which may be single stranded or double stranded and may represent a sense or antisense complementary strand to peptide nucleic acid PNA or to any DNA like or RNA like material natural or synthetic in origin. The phrases nucleic acid or nucleic acid sequence includes oligonucleotide nucleotide polynucleotide or to a fragment of any of these to DNA or RNA e.g. mRNA rRNA tRNA iRNA of genomic or synthetic origin which may be single stranded or double stranded and may represent a sense or antisense strand to peptide nucleic acid PNA or to any DNA like or RNA like material natural or synthetic in origin including e.g. iRNA ribonucleoproteins e.g. e.g. double stranded iRNAs e.g. iRNPs . The term encompasses nucleic acids i.e. oligonucleotides containing known analogues of natural nucleotides. The term also encompasses nucleic acid like structures with synthetic backbones see e.g. Mata 1997 Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 144 189 197 Strauss Soukup 1997 Biochemistry 36 8692 8698 Samstag 1996 Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev 6 153 156. Oligonucleotide includes either a single stranded polydeoxynucleotide or two complementary polydeoxynucleotide strands which may be chemically synthesized. Such synthetic oligonucleotides have no 5 phosphate and thus will not ligate to another oligonucleotide without adding a phosphate with an ATP in the presence of a kinase. A synthetic oligonucleotide can ligate to a fragment that has not been dephosphorylated.

A coding sequence of or a nucleotide sequence encoding a particular polypeptide or protein is a nucleic acid sequence which is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide or protein when placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences. The term gene means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain it includes regions preceding and following the coding region leader and trailer as well as where applicable intervening sequences introns between individual coding segments exons . Operably linked as used herein refers to a functional relationship between two or more nucleic acid e.g. DNA segments. Typically it refers to the functional relationship of transcriptional regulatory sequence to a transcribed sequence. For example a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence such as a nucleic acid of the invention if it stimulates or modulates the transcription of the coding sequence in an appropriate host cell or other expression system. Generally promoter transcriptional regulatory sequences that are operably linked to a transcribed sequence are physically contiguous to the transcribed sequence i.e. they are cis acting. However some transcriptional regulatory sequences such as enhancers need not be physically contiguous or located in close proximity to the coding sequences whose transcription they enhance.

As used herein the term promoter includes all sequences capable of driving transcription of a coding sequence in a cell e.g. a plant cell. Thus promoters used in the constructs of the invention include cis acting transcriptional control elements and regulatory sequences that are involved in regulating or modulating the timing and or rate of transcription of a gene. For example a promoter can be a cis acting transcriptional control element including an enhancer a promoter a transcription terminator an origin of replication a chromosomal integration sequence 5 and 3 untranslated regions or an intronic sequence which are involved in transcriptional regulation. These cis acting sequences typically interact with proteins or other biomolecules to carry out turn on off regulate modulate etc. transcription. Constitutive promoters are those that drive expression continuously under most environmental conditions and states of development or cell differentiation. Inducible or regulatable promoters direct expression of the nucleic acid of the invention under the influence of environmental conditions or developmental conditions. Examples of environmental conditions that may affect transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions elevated temperature drought or the presence of light.

 Plasmids can be commercially available publicly available on an unrestricted basis or can be constructed from available plasmids in accord with published procedures. Equivalent plasmids to those described herein are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

In one aspect the term recombinant means that the nucleic acid is adjacent to a backbone nucleic acid to which it is not adjacent in its natural environment. Additionally to be enriched the nucleic acids will represent 5 or more of the number of nucleic acid inserts in a population of nucleic acid backbone molecules. Backbone molecules according to the invention include nucleic acids such as expression vectors self replicating nucleic acids viruses integrating nucleic acids and other vectors or nucleic acids used to maintain or manipulate a nucleic acid insert of interest. Typically the enriched nucleic acids represent 15 or more of the number of nucleic acid inserts in the population of recombinant backbone molecules. More typically the enriched nucleic acids represent 50 or more of the number of nucleic acid inserts in the population of recombinant backbone molecules. In a one aspect the enriched nucleic acids represent 90 or more of the number of nucleic acid inserts in the population of recombinant backbone molecules.

One aspect of the invention is an isolated nucleic acid comprising one of the sequences of the invention or a fragment comprising at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 or 500 or more consecutive bases of a nucleic acid of the invention. The isolated nucleic acids may comprise DNA including cDNA genomic DNA and synthetic DNA. The DNA may be double stranded or single stranded and if single stranded may be the coding strand or non coding anti sense strand. Alternatively the isolated nucleic acids may comprise RNA.

The isolated nucleic acids of the invention may be used to prepare one of the polypeptides of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 or more consecutive amino acids of one of the polypeptides of the invention.

The coding sequences of these nucleic acids may be identical to one of the coding sequences of one of the nucleic acids of the invention or may be different coding sequences which encode one of the of the invention having at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 or more consecutive amino acids of one of the polypeptides of the invention as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code. The genetic code is well known to those of skill in the art and can be obtained e.g. on page 214 of B. Lewin Genes VI Oxford University Press 1997.

Thus as used herein the term polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide encompasses a polynucleotide which includes only the coding sequence for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide which includes additional coding and or non coding sequence.

Alternatively the nucleic acid sequences of the invention may be mutagenized using conventional techniques such as site directed mutagenesis or other techniques familiar to those skilled in the art to introduce silent changes into the polynucleotides o of the invention. As used herein silent changes include for example changes which do not alter the amino acid sequence encoded by the polynucleotide. Such changes may be desirable in order to increase the level of the polypeptide produced by host cells containing a vector encoding the polypeptide by introducing codons or codon pairs which occur frequently in the host organism.

The invention also relates to polynucleotides which have nucleotide changes which result in amino acid substitutions additions deletions fusions and truncations in the polypeptides of the invention. Such nucleotide changes may be introduced using techniques such as site directed mutagenesis random chemical mutagenesis exonuclease III deletion and other recombinant DNA techniques. Alternatively such nucleotide changes may be naturally occurring allelic variants which are isolated by identifying nucleic acids which specifically hybridize to probes comprising at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 or 500 consecutive bases of one of the sequences of the invention or the sequences complementary thereto under conditions of high moderate or low stringency as provided herein.

Recombinant polypeptides generated from these nucleic acids can be individually isolated or cloned and tested for a desired activity. Any recombinant expression system can be used including bacterial mammalian yeast insect or plant cell expression systems.

Alternatively these nucleic acids can be synthesized in vitro by well known chemical synthesis techniques as described in e.g. Adams 1983 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105 661 Belousov 1997 Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3440 3444 Frenkel 1995 Free Radic. Biol. Med. 19 373 380 Blommers 1994 Biochemistry 33 7886 7896 Narang 1979 Meth. Enzymol. 68 90 Brown 1979 Meth. Enzymol. 68 109 Beaucage 1981 Tetra. Lett. 22 1859 U.S. Pat. No. 4 458 066.

Techniques for the manipulation of nucleic acids such as e.g. subcloning labeling probes e.g. random primer labeling using Klenow polymerase nick translation amplification sequencing hybridization and the like are well described in the scientific and patent literature see e.g. Sambrook ed.

Detection and purification facilitating domains include e.g. metal chelating peptides such as polyhistidine tracts and histidine tryptophan modules that allow purification on immobilized metals protein A domains that allow purification on immobilized immunoglobulin and the domain utilized in the FLAGS extension affinity purification system Immunex Corp Seattle Wash. . The inclusion of a cleavable linker sequences such as Factor Xa or enterokinase Invitrogen San Diego Calif. between a purification domain and the motif comprising peptide or polypeptide to facilitate purification. For example an expression vector can include an epitope encoding nucleic acid sequence linked to six histidine residues followed by a thioredoxin and an enterokinase cleavage site see e.g. Williams 1995 Biochemistry 34 1787 1797 Dobeli 1998 Protein Expr. Purif. 12 404 414 . The histidine residues facilitate detection and purification while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a means for purifying the epitope from the remainder of the fusion protein.

The invention provides expression cassettes that can be expressed in a tissue specific manner e.g. that can express a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention in a tissue specific manner. The invention also provides plants or seeds that express a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention in a tissue specific manner.

The term expression cassette as used herein refers to a nucleotide sequence which is capable of affecting expression of a structural gene i.e. a protein coding sequence such as a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention in a host compatible with such sequences. Expression cassettes include at least a promoter operably linked with the polypeptide coding sequence and optionally with other sequences e.g. transcription termination signals. Additional factors necessary or helpful in effecting expression may also be used e.g. enhancers alpha factors. Thus expression cassettes also include plasmids expression vectors recombinant viruses any form of recombinant naked DNA vector and the like. A vector comprises a nucleic acid which can infect transfect transiently or permanently transduce a cell. It will be recognized that a vector can be a naked nucleic acid or a nucleic acid complexed with protein or lipid. The vector optionally comprises viral or bacterial nucleic acids and or proteins and or membranes e.g. a cell membrane a viral lipid envelope etc. . Vectors include but are not limited to replicons e.g. RNA replicons bacteriophages to which fragments of DNA may be attached and become replicated. Vectors thus include but are not limited to RNA autonomous self replicating circular or linear DNA or RNA e.g. plasmids viruses and the like see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 217 879 and include both the expression and non expression plasmids. Where a recombinant microorganism or cell culture is described as hosting an expression vector this includes both extra chromosomal circular and linear DNA and DNA that has been incorporated into the host chromosome s . Where a vector is being maintained by a host cell the vector may either be stably replicated by the cells during mitosis as an autonomous structure or is incorporated within the host s genome.

 Tissue specific promoters are transcriptional control elements that are only active in particular cells or tissues or organs e.g. in plants or animals. Tissue specific regulation may be achieved by certain intrinsic factors which ensure that genes encoding proteins specific to a given tissue are expressed. Such factors are known to exist in mammals and plants so as to allow for specific tissues to develop.

The term plant includes whole plants plant parts e.g. leaves stems flowers roots etc. plant protoplasts seeds and plant cells and progeny of same. The class of plants which can be used in the method of the invention is generally as broad as the class of higher plants amenable to transformation techniques including angiosperms monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants as well as gymnosperms. It includes plants of a variety of ploidy levels including polyploid diploid haploid and hemizygous states. As used herein the term transgenic plant includes plants or plant cells into which a heterologous nucleic acid sequence has been inserted e.g. the nucleic acids and various recombinant constructs e.g. expression cassettes of the invention.

In one aspect a constitutive promoter such as the CaMV 35S promoter can be used for expression in specific parts of the plant or seed or throughout the plant. For example for overexpression a plant promoter fragment can be employed which will direct expression of a nucleic acid in some or all tissues of a plant e.g. a regenerated plant. Such promoters are referred to herein as constitutive promoters and are active under most environmental conditions and states of development or cell differentiation. Examples of constitutive promoters include the cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV 35S transcription initiation region the 1 or 2 promoter derived from T DNA of and other transcription initiation regions from various plant genes known to those of skill. Such genes include e.g. ACT11 from Huang 1996 33 125 139 Cat3 from GenBank No. U43147 Zhong 1996 251 196 203 the gene encoding stearoyl acyl carrier protein desaturase from Genbank No. X74782 Solocombe 1994 104 1167 1176 GPc1 from maize GenBank No. X15596 Martinez 1989 208 551 565 the Gpc2 from maize GenBank No. U45855 Manjunath 1997 33 97 112 plant promoters described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 962 028 5 633 440.

The invention uses tissue specific or constitutive promoters derived from viruses which can include e.g. the tobamovirus subgenomic promoter Kumagai 1995 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 1679 1683 the rice tungro bacilliform virus RTBV which replicates only in phloem cells in infected rice plants with its promoter which drives strong phloem specific reporter gene expression the cassava vein mosaic virus CVMV promoter with highest activity in vascular elements in leaf mesophyll cells and in root tips Verdaguer 1996 Plant Mol. Biol. 31 1129 1139 .

Alternatively the plant promoter may direct expression of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein expressing nucleic acid in a specific tissue organ or cell type i.e. tissue specific promoters or may be otherwise under more precise environmental or developmental control or under the control of an inducible promoter. Examples of environmental conditions that may affect transcription include anaerobic conditions elevated temperature the presence of light or sprayed with chemicals hormones. For example the invention incorporates the drought inducible promoter of maize Busk 1997 supra the cold drought and high salt inducible promoter from potato Kirch 1997 Plant Mol. Biol. 33 897 909 .

Tissue specific promoters can promote transcription only within a certain time frame of developmental stage within that tissue. See e.g. Blazquez 1998 Plant Cell 10 791 800 characterizing the LEAFY gene promoter. See also Cardon 1997 12 367 77 describing the transcription factor SPL3 which recognizes a conserved sequence motif in the promoter region of the floral meristem identity gene AP1 and Mandel 1995 Plant Molecular Biology Vol. 29 pp 995 1004 describing the meristem promoter eIF4. Tissue specific promoters which are active throughout the life cycle of a particular tissue can be used. In one aspect the nucleic acids of the invention are operably linked to a promoter active primarily only in cotton fiber cells. In one aspect the nucleic acids of the invention are operably linked to a promoter active primarily during the stages of cotton fiber cell elongation e.g. as described by Rinehart 1996 supra. The nucleic acids can be operably linked to the Fbl2A gene promoter to be preferentially expressed in cotton fiber cells Ibid . See also John 1997 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 5769 5773 John et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 608 148 and 5 602 321 describing cotton fiber specific promoters and methods for the construction of transgenic cotton plants. Root specific promoters may also be used to express the nucleic acids of the invention. Examples of root specific promoters include the promoter from the alcohol dehydrogenase gene DeLisle 1990 Int. Rev. Cytol. 123 39 60 . Other promoters that can be used to express the nucleic acids of the invention include e.g. ovule specific embryo specific endosperm specific integument specific seed coat specific promoters or some combination thereof a leaf specific promoter see e.g. Busk 1997 Plant J. 11 1285 1295 describing a leaf specific promoter in maize the ORF13 promoter from which exhibits high activity in roots see e.g. Hansen 1997 supra a maize pollen specific promoter see e.g. Guerrero 1990 Mol. Gen. Genet. 224 161 168 a tomato promoter active during fruit ripening senescence and abscission of leaves and to a lesser extent of flowers can be used see e.g. Blume 1997 Plant J. 12 731 746 a pistil specific promoter from the potato SK2 gene see e.g. Ficker 1997 Plant Mol. Biol. 35 425 431 the Blec4 gene from pea which is active in epidermal tissue of vegetative and floral shoot apices of transgenic alfalfa making it a useful tool to target the expression of foreign genes to the epidermal layer of actively growing shoots or fibers the ovule specific BEL1 gene see e.g. Reiser 1995 Cell 83 735 742 GenBank No. U39944 and or the promoter in Klee U.S. Pat. No. 5 589 583 describing a plant promoter region is capable of conferring high levels of transcription in meristematic tissue and or rapidly dividing cells.

Alternatively plant promoters which are inducible upon exposure to plant hormones such as auxins are used to express the nucleic acids of the invention. For example the invention can use the auxin response elements E1 promoter fragment AuxREs in the soybean L. Liu 1997 Plant Physiol. 115 397 407 the auxin responsive GST6 promoter also responsive to salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide Chen 1996 Plant J. 10 955 966 the auxin inducible parC promoter from tobacco Sakai 1996 37 906 913 a plant biotin response element Streit 1997 Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 10 933 937 and the promoter responsive to the stress hormone abscisic acid Sheen 1996 Science 274 1900 1902 .

The nucleic acids of the invention can also be operably linked to plant promoters which are inducible upon exposure to chemicals reagents which can be applied to the plant such as herbicides or antibiotics. For example the maize In2 2 promoter activated by benzenesulfonamide herbicide safeners can be used De Veylder 1997 Plant Cell Physiol. 38 568 577 application of different herbicide safeners induces distinct gene expression patterns including expression in the root hydathodes and the shoot apical meristem. Coding sequence can be under the control of e.g. a tetracycline inducible promoter e.g. as described with transgenic tobacco plants containing the L. oat arginine decarboxylase gene Masgrau 1997 Plant J. 11 465 473 or a salicylic acid responsive element Stange 1997 Plant J. 11 1315 1324 . Using chemically e.g. hormone or pesticide induced promoters i.e. promoter responsive to a chemical which can be applied to the transgenic plant in the field expression of a polypeptide of the invention can be induced at a particular stage of development of the plant. Thus the invention also provides for transgenic plants containing an inducible gene encoding for polypeptides of the invention whose host range is limited to target plant species such as corn rice barley wheat potato or other crops inducible at any stage of development of the crop.

One of skill will recognize that a tissue specific plant promoter may drive expression of operably linked sequences in tissues other than the target tissue. Thus a tissue specific promoter is one that drives expression preferentially in the target tissue or cell type but may also lead to some expression in other tissues as well.

The nucleic acids of the invention can also be operably linked to plant promoters which are inducible upon exposure to chemicals reagents. These reagents include e.g. herbicides synthetic auxins or antibiotics which can be applied e.g. sprayed onto transgenic plants. Inducible expression of the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein producing nucleic acids of the invention will allow the grower to select plants with the optimal polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein expression and or activity. The development of plant parts can thus controlled. In this way the invention provides the means to facilitate the harvesting of plants and plant parts. For example in various embodiments the maize In2 2 promoter activated by benzenesulfonamide herbicide safeners is used De Veylder 1997 Plant Cell Physiol. 38 568 577 application of different herbicide safeners induces distinct gene expression patterns including expression in the root hydathodes and the shoot apical meristem. Coding sequences of the invention are also under the control of a tetracycline inducible promoter e.g. as described with transgenic tobacco plants containing the L. oat arginine decarboxylase gene Masgrau 1997 Plant J. 11 465 473 or a salicylic acid responsive element Stange 1997 Plant J. 11 1315 1324 .

In some aspects proper polypeptide expression may require polyadenylation region at the 3 end of the coding region. The polyadenylation region can be derived from the natural gene from a variety of other plant or animal or other genes or from genes in the T DNA.

Such selectable markers include genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase or genes conferring neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture genes conferring tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in and the TRP 1 gene. Promoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using chloramphenicol transferase CAT vectors or other vectors with selectable markers.

Vectors for expressing the polypeptide or fragment thereof in eukaryotic cells can also contain enhancers to increase expression levels. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA that can be from about 10 to about 300 bp in length. They can act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Exemplary enhancers include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin by 100 to 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and the adenovirus enhancers.

A nucleic acid sequence can be inserted into a vector by a variety of procedures.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 1633 1637. Alternatively coding sequences i.e. all or sub fragments of sequences of the invention can be inserted into a plant host cell genome becoming an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA. Sense or antisense transcripts can be expressed in this manner. A vector comprising the sequences e.g. promoters or coding regions from nucleic acids of the invention can comprise a marker gene that confers a selectable phenotype on a plant cell or a seed.

Furthermore for integrating expression vectors the expression vector can contain at least one sequence homologous to the host cell genome. It can contain two homologous sequences which flank the expression construct. The integrating vector can be directed to a specific locus in the host cell by selecting the appropriate homologous sequence for inclusion in the vector.

The extent of sequence identity homology may be determined using any computer program and associated parameters including those described herein such as BLAST 2.2.2. or FASTA version 3.0t78 with the default parameters.

As used herein the terms computer computer program and processor are used in their broadest general contexts and incorporate all such devices as described in detail below.

Nucleic acid sequences of the invention can comprise at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 or 500 or more consecutive nucleotides of an exemplary sequence of the invention and sequences substantially identical thereto. Homologous sequences and fragments of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can refer to a sequence having at least about 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or more sequence identity homology to these sequences.

Homologous sequences also include RNA sequences in which uridines replace the thymines in the nucleic acid sequences of the invention. The homologous sequences may be obtained using any of the procedures described herein or may result from the correction of a sequencing error. It will be appreciated that the nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be represented in the traditional single character format See the inside back cover of Stryer Lubert. Biochemistry 3rd Ed. W. H Freeman Co. New York. or in any other format which records the identity of the nucleotides in a sequence.

Various sequence comparison programs identified elsewhere in this patent specification are particularly contemplated for use in this aspect of the invention. Protein and or nucleic acid sequence homologies may be evaluated using any of the variety of sequence comparison algorithms and programs known in the art. Such algorithms and programs include but are by no means limited to TBLASTN BLASTP FASTA TFASTA and CLUSTALW see e.g. Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 8 2444 2448 1988 Altschul et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215 3 403 410 1990 Thompson Nucleic Acids Res. 22 2 4673 4680 1994 Higgins et al. Methods Enzymol. 266 383 402 1996 Altschul et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215 3 403 410 1990 Altschul et al. Nature Genetics 3 266 272 1993 .

Homology or identity is often measured using sequence analysis software e.g. Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center 1710 University Avenue Madison Wis. 53705 . Such software matches similar sequences by assigning degrees of homology to various deletions substitutions and other modifications. The terms homology and identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using any number of sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection.

For sequence comparison typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are entered into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence based on the program parameters.

A comparison window as used herein includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600 usually about 50 to about 200 more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequence for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman Wunsch J. Mol. Biol 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of person Lipman Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Other algorithms for determining homology or identity include for example in addition to a BLAST program Basic Local Alignment Search Tool at the National Center for Biological Information ALIGN AMAS Analysis of Multiply Aligned Sequences AMPS Protein Multiple Sequence Alignment ASSET Aligned Segment Statistical Evaluation Tool BANDS BESTSCOR BIOSCAN Biological Sequence Comparative Analysis Node BLIMPS BLocks IMProved Searcher FASTA Intervals Points BMB CLUSTAL V CLUSTAL W CONSENSUS LCONSENSUS WCONSENSUS Smith Waterman algorithm DARWIN Las Vegas algorithm FNAT Forced Nucleotide Alignment Tool Framealign Framesearch DYNAMIC FILTER FSAP Fristensky Sequence Analysis Package GAP Global Alignment Program GENAL GIBBS GenQuest ISSC Sensitive Sequence Comparison LALIGN Local Sequence Alignment LCP Local Content Program MACAW Multiple Alignment Construction Analysis Workbench MAP Multiple Alignment Program MBLKP MBLKN PIMA Pattern Induced Multi sequence Alignment SAGA Sequence Alignment by Genetic Algorithm and WHAT IF. Such alignment programs can also be used to screen genome databases to identify polynucleotide sequences having substantially identical sequences. A number of genome databases are available for example a substantial portion of the human genome is available as part of the Human Genome Sequencing Project Gibbs 1995 . At least twenty one other genomes have already been sequenced including for example Fraser et al. 1995 Bult et al. 1996 Fleischmann et al. 1995 Blattner et al. 1997 and yeast Mewes et al. 1997 and Adams et al. 2000 . Significant progress has also been made in sequencing the genomes of model organism such as mouse and sp. Several databases containing genomic information annotated with some functional information are maintained by different organizations and may be accessible via internet.

One example of a useful algorithm is BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms which are described in Altschul et al. Nuc. Acids Res. 25 3389 3402 1977 and Altschul et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410 1990 respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs HSPs by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence which either match or satisfy some positive valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold Altschul et al. supra . These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using for nucleotide sequences the parameters M reward score for a pair of matching residues always 0 . For amino acid sequences a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value the cumulative score goes to zero or below due to the accumulation of one or more negative scoring residue alignments or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W T and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program for nucleotide sequences uses as defaults a wordlength W of 11 an expectation E of 10 M 5 N 4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3 and expectations E of 10 and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix see Henikoff Henikoff Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 10915 1989 alignments B of 50 expectation E of 10 M 5 N 4 and a comparison of both strands.

The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences see e.g. Karlin Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5873 1993 . One measure of similarity provided by BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability P N which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example a nucleic acid is considered similar to a references sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2 more in one aspect less than about 0.01 and most in one aspect less than about 0.001.

In one aspect protein and nucleic acid sequence homologies are evaluated using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST In particular five specific BLAST programs are used to perform the following task 

The BLAST programs identify homologous sequences by identifying similar segments which are referred to herein as high scoring segment pairs between a query amino or nucleic acid sequence and a test sequence which is in one aspect obtained from a protein or nucleic acid sequence database. High scoring segment pairs are in one aspect identified i.e. aligned by means of a scoring matrix many of which are known in the art. In one aspect the scoring matrix used is the BLOSUM62 matrix Gonnet 1992 Science 256 1443 1445 Henikoff and Henikoff 1993 Proteins 17 49 61 . Less in one aspect the PAM or PAM250 matrices may also be used see e.g. Schwartz and Dayhoff eds. 1978 Washington National Biomedical Research Foundation . BLAST programs are accessible through the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

The parameters used with the above algorithms may be adapted depending on the sequence length and degree of homology studied. In some aspects the parameters may be the default parameters used by the algorithms in the absence of instructions from the user.

Substantially identical or homologous polypeptide sequences refer to a polypeptide sequence having at least 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or more or complete 100 sequence identity homology to an exemplary sequence of the invention.

Homology sequence identity may be determined using any of the computer programs and parameters described herein. A nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence of the invention can be stored recorded and manipulated on any medium which can be read and accessed by a computer.

Computer readable media include magnetically readable media optically readable media electronically readable media and magnetic optical media. For example the computer readable media may be a hard disk a floppy disk a magnetic tape CD ROM Digital Versatile Disk DVD Random Access Memory RAM or Read Only Memory ROM as well as other types of other media known to those skilled in the art.

Aspects of the invention include systems e.g. internet based systems particularly computer systems which store and manipulate the sequence information described herein. One example of a computer system is illustrated in block diagram form in . As used herein a computer system refers to the hardware components software components and data storage components used to analyze a nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention. The computer system typically includes a processor for processing accessing and manipulating the sequence data. The processor can be any well known type of central processing unit such as for example the Pentium III from Intel Corporation or similar processor from Sun Motorola Compaq AMD or International Business Machines.

Typically the computer system is a general purpose system that comprises the processor and one or more internal data storage components for storing data and one or more data retrieving devices for retrieving the data stored on the data storage components. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer systems are suitable.

In one particular aspect the computer system includes a processor connected to a bus which is connected to a main memory in one aspect implemented as RAM and one or more internal data storage devices such as a hard drive and or other computer readable media having data recorded thereon. In some aspects the computer system further includes one or more data retrieving device for reading the data stored on the internal data storage devices .

The data retrieving device may represent for example a floppy disk drive a compact disk drive a magnetic tape drive or a modem capable of connection to a remote data storage system e.g. via internet etc. In some aspects the internal data storage device is a removable computer readable medium such as a floppy disk a compact disk a magnetic tape etc. containing control logic and or data recorded thereon. The computer system may advantageously include or be programmed by appropriate software for reading the control logic and or the data from the data storage component once inserted in the data retrieving device.

The computer system includes a display. which is used to display output to a computer user. It should also be noted that the computer system can be linked to other computer systems A C in a network or wide area network to provide centralized access to the computer system .

Software for accessing and processing the nucleotide sequences of a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention such as search tools compare tools and modeling tools etc. may reside in main memory during execution.

In some aspects the computer system may further comprise a sequence comparison algorithm for comparing a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention stored on a computer readable medium to a reference nucleotide or polypeptide sequence s stored on a computer readable medium. A sequence comparison algorithm refers to one or more programs which are implemented locally or remotely on the computer system to compare a nucleotide sequence with other nucleotide sequences and or compounds stored within a data storage means. For example the sequence comparison algorithm may compare the nucleotide sequences of a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention stored on a computer readable medium to reference sequences stored on a computer readable medium to identify homologies or structural motifs.

The process begins at a start state and then moves to a state wherein the new sequence to be compared is stored to a memory in a computer system . As discussed above the memory could be any type of memory including RAM or an internal storage device.

The process then moves to a state wherein a database of sequences is opened for analysis and comparison. The process then moves to a state wherein the first sequence stored in the database is read into a memory on the computer. A comparison is then performed at a state to determine if the first sequence is the same as the second sequence. It is important to note that this step is not limited to performing an exact comparison between the new sequence and the first sequence in the database. Well known methods are known to those of skill in the art for comparing two nucleotide or protein sequences even if they are not identical. For example gaps can be introduced into one sequence in order to raise the homology level between the two tested sequences. The parameters that control whether gaps or other features are introduced into a sequence during comparison are normally entered by the user of the computer system.

Once a comparison of the two sequences has been performed at the state a determination is made at a decision state whether the two sequences are the same. Of course the term same is not limited to sequences that are absolutely identical. Sequences that are within the homology parameters entered by the user will be marked as same in the process .

If a determination is made that the two sequences are the same the process moves to a state wherein the name of the sequence from the database is displayed to the user. This state notifies the user that the sequence with the displayed name fulfills the homology constraints that were entered. Once the name of the stored sequence is displayed to the user the process moves to a decision state wherein a determination is made whether more sequences exist in the database. If no more sequences exist in the database then the process terminates at an end state . However if more sequences do exist in the database then the process moves to a state wherein a pointer is moved to the next sequence in the database so that it can be compared to the new sequence. In this manner the new sequence is aligned and compared with every sequence in the database.

It should be noted that if a determination had been made at the decision state that the sequences were not homologous then the process would move immediately to the decision state in order to determine if any other sequences were available in the database for comparison.

Accordingly one aspect of the invention is a computer system comprising a processor a data storage device having stored thereon a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention a data storage device having retrievably stored thereon reference nucleotide sequences or polypeptide sequences to be compared to a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention and a sequence comparer for conducting the comparison. The sequence comparer may indicate a homology level between the sequences compared or identify structural motifs in the above described nucleic acid code a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention or it may identify structural motifs in sequences which are compared to these nucleic acid codes and polypeptide codes. In some aspects the data storage device may have stored thereon the sequences of at least 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 or 40 or more of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention or the polypeptide sequences of the invention.

Another aspect of the invention is a method for determining the level of homology between a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention and a reference nucleotide sequence. The method including reading the nucleic acid code or the polypeptide code and the reference nucleotide or polypeptide sequence through the use of a computer program which determines homology levels and determining homology between the nucleic acid code or polypeptide code and the reference nucleotide or polypeptide sequence with the computer program. The computer program may be any of a number of computer programs for determining homology levels including those specifically enumerated herein e.g. BLAST2N with the default parameters or with any modified parameters . The method may be implemented using the computer systems described above. The method may also be performed by reading at least 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 or 40 or more of the above described nucleic acid sequences of the invention or the polypeptide sequences of the invention through use of the computer program and determining homology between the nucleic acid codes or polypeptide codes and reference nucleotide sequences or polypeptide sequences.

A determination is then made at a decision state whether the two characters are the same. If they are the same then the process moves to a state wherein the next characters in the first and second sequences are read. A determination is then made whether the next characters are the same. If they are then the process continues this loop until two characters are not the same. If a determination is made that the next two characters are not the same the process moves to a decision state to determine whether there are any more characters either sequence to read.

If there are not any more characters to read then the process moves to a state wherein the level of homology between the first and second sequences is displayed to the user. The level of homology is determined by calculating the proportion of characters between the sequences that were the same out of the total number of sequences in the first sequence. Thus if every character in a first 100 nucleotide sequence aligned with a every character in a second sequence the homology level would be 100 .

Alternatively the computer program may be a computer program which compares the nucleotide sequences of a nucleic acid sequence as set forth in the invention to one or more reference nucleotide sequences in order to determine whether the nucleic acid code of the invention differs from a reference nucleic acid sequence at one or more positions. Optionally such a program records the length and identity of inserted deleted or substituted nucleotides with respect to the sequence of either the reference polynucleotide or a nucleic acid sequence of the invention. In one aspect the computer program may be a program which determines whether a nucleic acid sequence of the invention contains a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP with respect to a reference nucleotide sequence.

Accordingly another aspect of the invention is a method for determining whether a nucleic acid sequence of the invention differs at one or more nucleotides from a reference nucleotide sequence comprising the steps of reading the nucleic acid code and the reference nucleotide sequence through use of a computer program which identifies differences between nucleic acid sequences and identifying differences between the nucleic acid code and the reference nucleotide sequence with the computer program. In some aspects the computer program is a program which identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms. The method may be implemented by the computer systems described above and the method illustrated in . The method may also be performed by reading at least 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 or 40 or more of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention and the reference nucleotide sequences through the use of the computer program and identifying differences between the nucleic acid codes and the reference nucleotide sequences with the computer program.

In other aspects the computer based system may further comprise an identifier for identifying features within a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention.

An identifier refers to one or more programs which identifies certain features within a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention. In one aspect the identifier may comprise a program which identifies an open reading frame in a nucleic acid sequence of the invention.

Once the database of features is opened at the state the process moves to a state wherein the first feature is read from the database. A comparison of the attribute of the first feature with the first sequence is then made at a state . A determination is then made at a decision state whether the attribute of the feature was found in the first sequence. If the attribute was found then the process moves to a state wherein the name of the found feature is displayed to the user.

The process then moves to a decision state wherein a determination is made whether move features exist in the database. If no more features do exist then the process terminates at an end state . However if more features do exist in the database then the process reads the next sequence feature at a state and loops back to the state wherein the attribute of the next feature is compared against the first sequence. It should be noted that if the feature attribute is not found in the first sequence at the decision state the process moves directly to the decision state in order to determine if any more features exist in the database.

Accordingly another aspect of the invention is a method of identifying a feature within a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention comprising reading the nucleic acid code s or polypeptide code s through the use of a computer program which identifies features therein and identifying features within the nucleic acid code s with the computer program. In one aspect computer program comprises a computer program which identifies open reading frames. The method may be performed by reading a single sequence or at least 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 or 40 of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention or the polypeptide sequences of the invention through the use of the computer program and identifying features within the nucleic acid codes or polypeptide codes with the computer program.

In addition many computer programs and databases may be used as sequence comparison algorithms identifiers or sources of reference nucleotide sequences or polypeptide sequences to be compared to a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or a polypeptide sequence of the invention. The following list is intended not to limit the invention but to provide guidance to programs and databases which are useful with the nucleic acid sequences of the invention or the polypeptide sequences of the invention.

The invention provides isolated or recombinant nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions to an exemplary sequence of the invention e.g. SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 5 SEQ ID NO 7 SEQ ID NO 9 . The stringent conditions can be highly stringent conditions medium stringent conditions and or low stringent conditions including the high and reduced stringency conditions described herein. In one aspect it is the stringency of the wash conditions that set forth the conditions which determine whether a nucleic acid is within the scope of the invention as discussed below.

 Hybridization refers to the process by which a nucleic acid strand joins with a complementary strand through base pairing. Hybridization reactions can be sensitive and selective so that a particular sequence of interest can be identified even in samples in which it is present at low concentrations. Suitably stringent conditions can be defined by for example the concentrations of salt or formamide in the prehybridization and hybridization solutions or by the hybridization temperature and are well known in the art. In particular stringency can be increased by reducing the concentration of salt increasing the concentration of formamide or raising the hybridization temperature. In alternative aspects nucleic acids of the invention are defined by their ability to hybridize under various stringency conditions e.g. high medium and low as set forth herein.

For example hybridization under high stringency conditions could occur in about 50 formamide at about 37 C. to 42 C. Hybridization could occur under reduced stringency conditions in about 35 to 25 formamide at about 30 C. to 35 C. In one aspect hybridization occurs under high stringency conditions e.g. at 42 C. in 50 formamide 5 SSPE 0.3 SDS and 200 n ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization could occur under these reduced stringency conditions but in 35 formamide at a reduced temperature of 35 C. The temperature range corresponding to a particular level of stringency can be further narrowed by calculating the purine to pyrimidine ratio of the nucleic acid of interest and adjusting the temperature accordingly. Variations on the above ranges and conditions are well known in the art.

In alternative aspects nucleic acids of the invention as defined by their ability to hybridize under stringent conditions can be between about five residues and the full length of nucleic acid of the invention e.g. they can be at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 90 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 or more residues in length. Nucleic acids shorter than full length are also included. These nucleic acids can be useful as e.g. hybridization probes labeling probes PCR oligonucleotide probes iRNA single or double stranded antisense or sequences encoding antibody binding peptides epitopes motifs active sites and the like.

In one aspect nucleic acids of the invention are defined by their ability to hybridize under high stringency comprises conditions of about 50 formamide at about 37 C. to 42 C. In one aspect nucleic acids of the invention are defined by their ability to hybridize under reduced stringency comprising conditions in about 35 to 25 formamide at about 30 C. to 35 C.

Alternatively nucleic acids of the invention are defined by their ability to hybridize under high stringency comprising conditions at 42 C. in 50 formamide 5 SSPE 0.3 SDS and a repetitive sequence blocking nucleic acid such as cot 1 or salmon sperm DNA e.g. 200 n ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA . In one aspect nucleic acids of the invention are defined by their ability to hybridize under reduced stringency conditions comprising 35 formamide at a reduced temperature of 35 C.

In nucleic acid hybridization reactions the conditions used to achieve a particular level of stringency will vary depending on the nature of the nucleic acids being hybridized. For example the length degree of complementarity nucleotide sequence composition e.g. GC v. AT content and nucleic acid type e.g. RNA v. DNA of the hybridizing regions of the nucleic acids can be considered in selecting hybridization conditions. An additional consideration is whether one of the nucleic acids is immobilized for example on a filter.

Hybridization may be carried out under conditions of low stringency moderate stringency or high stringency. As an example of nucleic acid hybridization a polymer membrane containing immobilized denatured nucleic acids is first prehybridized for 30 minutes at 45 C. in a solution consisting of 0.9 M NaCl 50 mM NaHPO pH 7.0 5.0 mM NaEDTA 0.5 SDS 10 Denhardt s and 0.5 mg ml polyriboadenylic acid. Approximately 2 10cpm specific activity 4 9 10cpm ug of P end labeled oligonucleotide probe are then added to the solution. After 12 16 hours of incubation the membrane is washed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 1 SET 150 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris hydrochloride pH 7.8 1 mM NaEDTA containing 0.5 SDS followed by a 30 minute wash in fresh 1 SET at T 10 C. for the oligonucleotide probe. The membrane is then exposed to auto radiographic film for detection of hybridization signals.

Following hybridization a filter can be washed to remove any non specifically bound detectable probe. The stringency used to wash the filters can also be varied depending on the nature of the nucleic acids being hybridized the length of the nucleic acids being hybridized the degree of complementarity the nucleotide sequence composition e.g. GC v. AT content and the nucleic acid type e.g. RNA v. DNA . Examples of progressively higher stringency condition washes are as follows 2 SSC 0.1 SDS at room temperature for 15 minutes low stringency 0.1 SSC 0.5 SDS at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour moderate stringency 0.1 SSC 0.5 SDS for 15 to 30 minutes at between the hybridization temperature and 68 C. high stringency and 0.15M NaCl for 15 minutes at 72 C. very high stringency . A final low stringency wash can be conducted in 0.1 SSC at room temperature. The examples above are merely illustrative of one set of conditions that can be used to wash filters. One of skill in the art would know that there are numerous recipes for different stringency washes. Some other examples are given below.

In one aspect hybridization conditions comprise a wash step comprising a wash for 30 minutes at room temperature in a solution comprising 1 150 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris hydrochloride pH 7.8 1 mM NaEDTA 0.5 SDS followed by a 30 minute wash in fresh solution.

Nucleic acids which have hybridized to the probe are identified by autoradiography or other conventional techniques.

The above procedure may be modified to identify nucleic acids having decreasing levels of homology to the probe sequence. For example to obtain nucleic acids of decreasing homology to the detectable probe less stringent conditions may be used. For example the hybridization temperature may be decreased in increments of 5 C. from 68 C. to 42 C. in a hybridization buffer having a Na concentration of approximately 1M. Following hybridization the filter may be washed with 2 SSC 0.5 SDS at the temperature of hybridization. These conditions are considered to be moderate conditions above 50 C. and low conditions below 50 C. A specific example of moderate hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 55 C. A specific example of low stringency hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 45 C.

Alternatively the hybridization may be carried out in buffers such as 6 SSC containing formamide at a temperature of 42 C. In this case the concentration of formamide in the hybridization buffer may be reduced in 5 increments from 50 to 0 to identify clones having decreasing levels of homology to the probe. Following hybridization the filter may be washed with 6 SSC 0.5 SDS at 50 C. These conditions are considered to be moderate conditions above 25 formamide and low conditions below 25 formamide. A specific example of moderate hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 30 formamide. A specific example of low stringency hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 10 formamide.

However the selection of a hybridization format is not critical it is the stringency of the wash conditions that set forth the conditions which determine whether a nucleic acid is within the scope of the invention. Wash conditions used to identify nucleic acids within the scope of the invention include e.g. a salt concentration of about 0.02 molar at pH 7 and a temperature of at least about 50 C. or about 55 C. to about 60 C. or a salt concentration of about 0.15 M NaCl at 72 C. for about 15 minutes or a salt concentration of about 0.2 SSC at a temperature of at least about 50 C. or about 55 C. to about 60 C. for about 15 to about 20 minutes or the hybridization complex is washed twice with a solution with a salt concentration of about 2 SSC containing 0.1 SDS at room temperature for 15 minutes and then washed twice by 0.1 SSC containing 0.1 SDS at 68 C. for 15 minutes or equivalent conditions. See Sambrook Tijssen and Ausubel for a description of SSC buffer and equivalent conditions.

These methods may be used to isolate nucleic acids of the invention. For example the preceding methods may be used to isolate nucleic acids having a sequence with at least about 97 at least 95 at least 90 at least 85 at least 80 at least 75 at least 70 at least 65 at least 60 at least 55 or at least 50 sequence identity homology to a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of one of the sequences of the invention or fragments comprising at least about 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 or 500 consecutive bases thereof and the sequences complementary thereto. Sequence identity homology may be measured using the alignment algorithm. For example the homologous polynucleotides may have a coding sequence which is a naturally occurring allelic variant of one of the coding sequences described herein. Such allelic variants may have a substitution deletion or addition of one or more nucleotides when compared to the nucleic acids of the invention. Additionally the above procedures may be used to isolate nucleic acids which encode polypeptides having at least about 99 95 at least 90 at least 85 at least 80 at least 75 at least 70 at least 65 at least 60 at least 55 or at least 50 sequence identity homology to a polypeptide of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 consecutive amino acids thereof as determined using a sequence alignment algorithm e.g. such as the FASTA version 3.0t78 algorithm with the default parameters .

The invention also provides nucleic acid probes that can be used e.g. for identifying nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide with an enzyme structural or binding activity or fragments thereof or for identifying polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein genes. In one aspect the probe comprises at least 10 consecutive bases of a nucleic acid of the invention. Alternatively a probe of the invention can be at least about 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 30 35 40 45 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 150 or about 10 to 50 about 20 to 60 about 30 to 70 consecutive bases of a sequence as set forth in a nucleic acid of the invention. The probes identify a nucleic acid by binding and or hybridization. The probes can be used in arrays of the invention see discussion below including e.g. capillary arrays. The probes of the invention can also be used to isolate other nucleic acids or polypeptides.

The isolated nucleic acids of the invention the sequences complementary thereto or a fragment comprising at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 or 500 consecutive bases of one of the sequences of the invention or the sequences complementary thereto may also be used as probes to determine whether a biological sample such as a soil sample contains an organism having a nucleic acid sequence of the invention or an organism from which the nucleic acid was obtained. In such procedures a biological sample potentially harboring the organism from which the nucleic acid was isolated is obtained and nucleic acids are obtained from the sample. The nucleic acids are contacted with the probe under conditions which permit the probe to specifically hybridize to any complementary sequences from which are present therein.

Where necessary conditions which permit the probe to specifically hybridize to complementary sequences may be determined by placing the probe in contact with complementary sequences from samples known to contain the complementary sequence as well as control sequences which do not contain the complementary sequence. Hybridization conditions such as the salt concentration of the hybridization buffer the formamide concentration of the hybridization buffer or the hybridization temperature may be varied to identify conditions which allow the probe to hybridize specifically to complementary nucleic acids.

If the sample contains the organism from which the nucleic acid was isolated specific hybridization of the probe is then detected. Hybridization may be detected by labeling the probe with a detectable agent such as a radioactive isotope a fluorescent dye or an enzyme capable of catalyzing the formation of a detectable product.

Many methods for using the labeled probes to detect the presence of complementary nucleic acids in a sample are familiar to those skilled in the art. These include Southern Blots Northern Blots colony hybridization procedures and dot blots. Protocols for each of these procedures are provided in Ausubel et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley 503 Sons Inc. 1997 and Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989.

Alternatively more than one probe at least one of which is capable of specifically hybridizing to any complementary sequences which are present in the nucleic acid sample may be used in an amplification reaction to determine whether the sample contains an organism containing a nucleic acid sequence of the invention e.g. an organism from which the nucleic acid was isolated . Typically the probes comprise oligonucleotides. In one aspect the amplification reaction may comprise a PCR reaction. PCR protocols are described in Ausubel and Sambrook supra. Alternatively the amplification may comprise a ligase chain reaction 3SR or strand displacement reaction. See Barany F. The Ligase Chain Reaction in a PCR World 1 5 16 1991 E. Fahy et al. Self sustained Sequence Replication 3SR An Isothermal Transcription based Amplification System Alternative to PCR 1 25 33 1991 and Walker G. T. et al. Strand Displacement Amplification an Isothermal in vitro DNA Amplification Technique 20 1691 1696 1992 . In such procedures the nucleic acids in the sample are contacted with the probes the amplification reaction is performed and any resulting amplification product is detected. The amplification product may be detected by performing gel electrophoresis on the reaction products and staining the gel with an intercalator such as ethidium bromide. Alternatively one or more of the probes may be labeled with a radioactive isotope and the presence of a radioactive amplification product may be detected by autoradiography after gel electrophoresis.

Probes derived from sequences near the ends of the sequences of the invention may also be used in chromosome walking procedures to identify clones containing genomic sequences located adjacent to the sequences of the invention. Such methods allow the isolation of genes which encode additional proteins from the host organism.

The isolated nucleic acids of the invention the sequences complementary thereto or a fragment comprising at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 or 500 consecutive bases of one of the sequences of the invention or the sequences complementary thereto may be used as probes to identify and isolate related nucleic acids. In some aspects the related nucleic acids may be cDNAs or genomic DNAs from organisms other than the one from which the nucleic acid was isolated. For example the other organisms may be related organisms. In such procedures a nucleic acid sample is contacted with the probe under conditions which permit the probe to specifically hybridize to related sequences. Hybridization of the probe to nucleic acids from the related organism is then detected using any of the methods described above.

By varying the stringency of the hybridization conditions used to identify nucleic acids such as cDNAs or genomic DNAs which hybridize to the detectable probe nucleic acids having different levels of homology to the probe can be identified and isolated. Stringency may be varied by conducting the hybridization at varying temperatures below the melting temperatures of the probes. The melting temperature T is the temperature under defined ionic strength and pH at which 50 of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly complementary probe. Very stringent conditions are selected to be equal to or about 5 C. lower than the Tfor a particular probe. The melting temperature of the probe may be calculated using the following formulas 

For probes between 14 and 70 nucleotides in length the melting temperature T is calculated using the formula T 81.5 16.6 log Na 0.41 fraction G C 600 N where N is the length of the probe.

If the hybridization is carried out in a solution containing formamide the melting temperature may be calculated using the equation T 81.5 16.6 log Na 0.41 fraction G C 0.63 formamide 600 N where N is the length of the probe.

Prehybridization may be carried out in 6 SSC 5 Denhardt s reagent 0.5 SDS 100 g denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA or 6 SSC 5 Denhardt s reagent 0.5 SDS 100 g denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA 50 formamide. The formulas for SSC and Denhardt s solutions are listed in Sambrook et al. supra.

Hybridization is conducted by adding the detectable probe to the prehybridization solutions listed above. Where the probe comprises double stranded DNA it is denatured before addition to the hybridization solution. The filter is contacted with the hybridization solution for a sufficient period of time to allow the probe to hybridize to cDNAs or genomic DNAs containing sequences complementary thereto or homologous thereto. For probes over 200 nucleotides in length the hybridization may be carried out at 15 25 C. below the T. For shorter probes such as oligonucleotide probes the hybridization may be conducted at 5 10 C. below the T. In one aspect for hybridizations in 6 SSC the hybridization is conducted at approximately 68 C. Usually for hybridizations in 50 formamide containing solutions the hybridization is conducted at approximately 42 C.

The invention provides nucleic acids complementary to e.g. antisense sequences to the nucleic acids of the invention e.g. nucleic acids comprising antisense iRNA ribozymes. Nucleic acids of the invention comprising antisense sequences can be capable of inhibiting the transport splicing or transcription of polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein genes. The inhibition can be effected through the targeting of genomic DNA or messenger RNA. The transcription or function of targeted nucleic acid can be inhibited for example by hybridization and or cleavage. In one aspect inhibitors of the invention include oligonucleotides which are able to either bind a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein gene or message in either case preventing or inhibiting the production or function of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. The association can be through sequence specific hybridization. Another useful class of inhibitors includes oligonucleotides which cause inactivation or cleavage of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein message. The oligonucleotide can have enzyme activity which causes such cleavage such as ribozymes. The oligonucleotide can be chemically modified or conjugated to an enzyme or composition capable of cleaving the complementary nucleic acid. A pool of many different such oligonucleotides can be screened for those with the desired activity. Thus the invention provides various compositions for the inhibition of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein expression on a nucleic acid and or protein level e.g. antisense iRNA and ribozymes comprising a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein sequences of the invention and the anti polypeptide anti enzyme anti protein e.g. anti structural or anti binding protein antibodies of the invention.

Inhibition of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein expression can have a variety of industrial applications. For example inhibition of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein expression can slow or prevent spoilage. In one aspect use of compositions of the invention that inhibit the expression and or activity of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein e.g. antibodies antisense oligonucleotides ribozymes and RNAi are used to slow or prevent spoilage. Thus in one aspect the invention provides methods and compositions comprising application onto a plant or plant product e.g. a cereal a grain a fruit seed root leaf etc. antibodies antisense oligonucleotides ribozymes and RNAi of the invention to slow or prevent spoilage. These compositions also can be expressed by the plant e.g. a transgenic plant or another organism e.g. a bacterium or other microorganism transformed with a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein gene of the invention .

The compositions of the invention for the inhibition of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein expression e.g. antisense iRNA e.g. siRNA miRNA ribozymes antibodies can be used as pharmaceutical compositions e.g. as anti pathogen agents or in other therapies e.g. as anti microbials for e.g. or to neutralize a biological warfare agent e.g. anthrax.

The invention provides antisense oligonucleotides capable of binding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein message which in one aspect can inhibit a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity by targeting mRNA. Strategies for designing antisense oligonucleotides are well described in the scientific and patent literature and the skilled artisan can design such a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein oligonucleotides using the novel reagents of the invention. For example gene walking RNA mapping protocols to screen for effective antisense oligonucleotides are well known in the art see e.g. Ho 2000 Methods Enzymol. 314 168 183 describing an RNA mapping assay which is based on standard molecular techniques to provide an easy and reliable method for potent antisense sequence selection. See also Smith 2000 Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 11 191 198.

Naturally occurring nucleic acids are used as antisense oligonucleotides. The antisense oligonucleotides can be of any length for example in alternative aspects the antisense oligonucleotides are between about 5 to 100 about 10 to 80 about 15 to 60 about 18 to 40. The optimal length can be determined by routine screening. The antisense oligonucleotides can be present at any concentration. The optimal concentration can be determined by routine screening. A wide variety of synthetic non naturally occurring nucleotide and nucleic acid analogues are known which can address this potential problem. For example peptide nucleic acids PNAs containing non ionic backbones such as N 2 aminoethyl glycine units can be used. Antisense oligonucleotides having phosphorothioate linkages can also be used as described in WO 97 03211 WO 96 39154 Mata 1997 Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 144 189 197 Antisense Therapeutics ed. Agrawal Humana Press Totowa N.J. 1996 . Antisense oligonucleotides having synthetic DNA backbone analogues provided by the invention can also include phosphoro dithioate methylphosphonate phosphoramidate alkyl phosphotriester sulfamate 3 thioacetal methylene methylimino 3 N carbamate and morpholino carbamate nucleic acids as described above.

Combinatorial chemistry methodology can be used to create vast numbers of oligonucleotides that can be rapidly screened for specific oligonucleotides that have appropriate binding affinities and specificities toward any target such as the sense and antisense a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein sequences of the invention see e.g. Gold 1995 J. of Biol. Chem. 270 13581 13584 .

The invention provides ribozymes capable of binding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein message. These ribozymes can inhibit a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity by e.g. targeting mRNA. Strategies for designing ribozymes and selecting the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein specific antisense sequence for targeting are well described in the scientific and patent literature and the skilled artisan can design such ribozymes using the novel reagents of the invention. Ribozymes act by binding to a target RNA through the target RNA binding portion of a ribozyme which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the RNA that cleaves the target RNA. Thus the ribozyme recognizes and binds a target RNA through complementary base pairing and once bound to the correct site acts enzymatically to cleave and inactivate the target RNA. Cleavage of a target RNA in such a manner will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein if the cleavage occurs in the coding sequence. After a ribozyme has bound and cleaved its RNA target it can be released from that RNA to bind and cleave new targets repeatedly.

In some circumstances the enzymatic nature of a ribozyme can be advantageous over other technologies such as antisense technology where a nucleic acid molecule simply binds to a nucleic acid target to block its transcription translation or association with another molecule as the effective concentration of ribozyme necessary to effect a therapeutic treatment can be lower than that of an antisense oligonucleotide. This potential advantage reflects the ability of the ribozyme to act enzymatically. Thus a single ribozyme molecule is able to cleave many molecules of target RNA. In addition a ribozyme is typically a highly specific inhibitor with the specificity of inhibition depending not only on the base pairing mechanism of binding but also on the mechanism by which the molecule inhibits the expression of the RNA to which it binds. That is the inhibition is caused by cleavage of the RNA target and so specificity is defined as the ratio of the rate of cleavage of the targeted RNA over the rate of cleavage of non targeted RNA. This cleavage mechanism is dependent upon factors additional to those involved in base pairing. Thus the specificity of action of a ribozyme can be greater than that of antisense oligonucleotide binding the same RNA site.

The ribozyme of the invention e.g. an enzymatic ribozyme RNA molecule can be formed in a hammerhead motif a hairpin motif as a hepatitis delta virus motif a group I intron motif and or an RNaseP like RNA in association with an RNA guide sequence. Examples of hammerhead motifs are described by e.g. Rossi 1992 Aids Research and Human Retroviruses 8 183 hairpin motifs by Hampel 1989 Biochemistry 28 4929 and Hampel 1990 Nuc. Acids Res. 18 299 the hepatitis delta virus motif by Perrotta 1992 Biochemistry 31 16 the RNaseP motif by Guerrier Takada 1983 Cell 35 849 and the group I intron by Cech U.S. Pat. No. 4 987 071. The recitation of these specific motifs is not intended to be limiting. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a ribozyme of the invention e.g. an enzymatic RNA molecule of this invention can have a specific substrate binding site complementary to one or more of the target gene RNA regions. A ribozyme of the invention can have a nucleotide sequence within or surrounding that substrate binding site which imparts an RNA cleaving activity to the molecule.

In one aspect the invention provides an RNA inhibitory molecule a so called RNAi molecule comprising a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein sequence of the invention. The RNAi molecule comprises a double stranded RNA dsRNA molecule. The RNAi can inhibit expression of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein gene. In one aspect the RNAi is about 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 or more duplex nucleotides in length. While the invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action the RNAi can enter a cell and cause the degradation of a single stranded RNA ssRNA of similar or identical sequences including endogenous mRNAs. When a cell is exposed to double stranded RNA dsRNA mRNA from the homologous gene is selectively degraded by a process called RNA interference RNAi . A possible basic mechanism behind RNAi e.g. siRNA for inhibiting transcription and or miRNA to inhibit translation is the breaking of a double stranded RNA dsRNA matching a specific gene sequence into short pieces called short interfering RNA which trigger the degradation of mRNA that matches its sequence. In one aspect the RNAi s of the invention are used in gene silencing therapeutics see e.g. Shuey 2002 Drug Discov. Today 7 1040 1046. In one aspect the invention provides methods to selectively degrade RNA using the RNAi s of the invention. The process may be practiced in vitro ex vivo or in vivo. In one aspect the RNAi molecules of the invention can be used to generate a loss of function mutation in a cell an organ or an animal. Methods for making and using RNAi molecules for selectively degrade RNA are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 506 559 6 511 824 6 515 109 6 489 127.

The invention provides methods of generating variants of the nucleic acids of the invention e.g. those encoding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. These methods can be repeated or used in various combinations to generate a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein having an altered or different activity or an altered or different stability from that of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein encoded by the template nucleic acid. These methods also can be repeated or used in various combinations e.g. to generate variations in gene message expression message translation or message stability. In another aspect the genetic composition of a cell is altered by e.g. modification of a homologous gene ex vivo followed by its reinsertion into the cell.

A nucleic acid of the invention can be altered by any means. For example random or stochastic methods or non stochastic or directed evolution methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 361 974. Methods for random mutation of genes are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 830 696. For example mutagens can be used to randomly mutate a gene. Mutagens include e.g. ultraviolet light or gamma irradiation or a chemical mutagen e.g. mitomycin nitrous acid photoactivated psoralens alone or in combination to induce DNA breaks amenable to repair by recombination. Other chemical mutagens include for example sodium bisulfite nitrous acid hydroxylamine hydrazine or formic acid. Other mutagens are analogues of nucleotide precursors e.g. nitrosoguanidine 5 bromouracil 2 aminopurine or acridine. These agents can be added to a PCR reaction in place of the nucleotide precursor thereby mutating the sequence. Intercalating agents such as proflavine acriflavine quinacrine and the like can also be used.

Any technique in molecular biology can be used e.g. random PCR mutagenesis see e.g. Rice 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 5467 5471 or combinatorial multiple cassette mutagenesis see e.g. Crameri 1995 Biotechniques 18 194 196. Alternatively nucleic acids e.g. genes can be reassembled after random or stochastic fragmentation see e.g. U.S. Pat.

Non stochastic or directed evolution methods include e.g. saturation mutagenesis such as Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis GSSM synthetic ligation reassembly SLR or a combination thereof are used to modify the nucleic acids of the invention to generate a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein with new or altered properties e.g. activity under highly acidic or alkaline conditions high or low temperatures and the like . Polypeptides encoded by the modified nucleic acids can be screened for an activity before testing for glucan hydrolysis or other activity. Any testing modality or protocol can be used e.g. using a capillary array platform. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 361 974 6 280 926 5 939 250.

The invention also provides methods for making enzyme using Gene Site Saturation mutagenesis or GSSM as described herein and also in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 171 820 and 6 579 258.

In one aspect codon primers containing a degenerate N N G T sequence are used to introduce point mutations into a polynucleotide e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or an antibody of the invention so as to generate a set of progeny polypeptides in which a full range of single amino acid substitutions is represented at each amino acid position e.g. an amino acid residue in an enzyme active site or ligand binding site targeted to be modified. These oligonucleotides can comprise a contiguous first homologous sequence a degenerate N N G T sequence and optionally a second homologous sequence. The downstream progeny translational products from the use of such oligonucleotides include all possible amino acid changes at each amino acid site along the polypeptide because the degeneracy of the N N G T sequence includes codons for all 20 amino acids. In one aspect one such degenerate oligonucleotide comprised of e.g. one degenerate N N G T cassette is used for subjecting each original codon in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. In another aspect at least two degenerate cassettes are used either in the same oligonucleotide or not for subjecting at least two original codons in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. For example more than one N N G T sequence can be contained in one oligonucleotide to introduce amino acid mutations at more than one site. This plurality of N N G T sequences can be directly contiguous or separated by one or more additional nucleotide sequence s . In another aspect oligonucleotides serviceable for introducing additions and deletions can be used either alone or in combination with the codons containing an N N G T sequence to introduce any combination or permutation of amino acid additions deletions and or substitutions.

In one aspect simultaneous mutagenesis of two or more contiguous amino acid positions is done using an oligonucleotide that contains contiguous N N G T triplets i.e. a degenerate N N G T n sequence. In another aspect degenerate cassettes having less degeneracy than the N N G T sequence are used. For example it may be desirable in some instances to use e.g. in an oligonucleotide a degenerate triplet sequence comprised of only one N where said N can be in the first second or third position of the triplet. Any other bases including any combinations and permutations thereof can be used in the remaining two positions of the triplet. Alternatively it may be desirable in some instances to use e.g. in an oligo a degenerate N N N triplet sequence.

In one aspect use of degenerate triplets e.g. N N G T triplets allows for systematic and easy generation of a full range of possible natural amino acids for a total of 20 amino acids into each and every amino acid position in a polypeptide in alternative aspects the methods also include generation of less than all possible substitutions per amino acid residue or codon position . For example for a 100 amino acid polypeptide 2000 distinct species i.e. 20 possible amino acids per position 100 amino acid positions can be generated. Through the use of an oligonucleotide or set of oligonucleotides containing a degenerate N N G T triplet 32 individual sequences can code for all 20 possible natural amino acids. Thus in a reaction vessel in which a parental polynucleotide sequence is subjected to saturation mutagenesis using at least one such oligonucleotide there are generated 32 distinct progeny polynucleotides encoding 20 distinct polypeptides. In contrast the use of a non degenerate oligonucleotide in site directed mutagenesis leads to only one progeny polypeptide product per reaction vessel. Nondegenerate oligonucleotides can optionally be used in combination with degenerate primers disclosed for example nondegenerate oligonucleotides can be used to generate specific point mutations in a working polynucleotide. This provides one means to generate specific silent point mutations point mutations leading to corresponding amino acid changes and point mutations that cause the generation of stop codons and the corresponding expression of polypeptide fragments.

In one aspect each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel contains polynucleotides encoding at least 20 progeny polypeptide e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein molecules such that all 20 natural amino acids are represented at the one specific amino acid position corresponding to the codon position mutagenized in the parental polynucleotide other aspects use less than all 20 natural combinations . The 32 fold degenerate progeny polypeptides generated from each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel can be subjected to clonal amplification e.g. cloned into a suitable host e.g. E. coif host using e.g. an expression vector and subjected to expression screening. When an individual progeny polypeptide is identified by screening to display a favorable change in property when compared to the parental polypeptide such as increased glucan hydrolysis activity under alkaline or acidic conditions it can be sequenced to identify the correspondingly favorable amino acid substitution contained therein.

In one aspect upon mutagenizing each and every amino acid position in a parental polypeptide using saturation mutagenesis as disclosed herein favorable amino acid changes may be identified at more than one amino acid position. One or more new progeny molecules can be generated that contain a combination of all or part of these favorable amino acid substitutions. For example if 2 specific favorable amino acid changes are identified in each of 3 amino acid positions in a polypeptide the permutations include 3 possibilities at each position no change from the original amino acid and each of two favorable changes and 3 positions. Thus there are 3 3 3 or 27 total possibilities including 7 that were previously examined 6 single point mutations i.e. 2 at each of three positions and no change at any position.

In yet another aspect site saturation mutagenesis can be used together with shuffling chimerization recombination and other mutagenizing processes along with screening. This invention provides for the use of any mutagenizing process es including saturation mutagenesis in an iterative manner. In one exemplification the iterative use of any mutagenizing process es is used in combination with screening.

The invention also provides for the use of proprietary codon primers containing a degenerate N N N sequence to introduce point mutations into a polynucleotide so as to generate a set of progeny polypeptides in which a full range of single amino acid substitutions is represented at each amino acid position e.g. with Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis GSSM . The oligos used are comprised contiguously of a first homologous sequence a degenerate N N N sequence and in one aspect but not necessarily a second homologous sequence. The downstream progeny translational products from the use of such oligos include all possible amino acid changes at each amino acid site along the polypeptide because the degeneracy of the N N N sequence includes codons for all 20 amino acids.

In one aspect one such degenerate oligo comprised of one degenerate N N N cassette is used for subjecting each original codon in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. In another aspect at least two degenerate N N N cassettes are used either in the same oligo or not for subjecting at least two original codons in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. Thus more than one N N N sequence can be contained in one oligo to introduce amino acid mutations at more than one site. This plurality of N N N sequences can be directly contiguous or separated by one or more additional nucleotide sequence s . In another aspect oligos serviceable for introducing additions and deletions can be used either alone or in combination with the codons containing an N N N sequence to introduce any combination or permutation of amino acid additions deletions and or substitutions.

In a particular exemplification it is possible to simultaneously mutagenize two or more contiguous amino acid positions using an oligo that contains contiguous N N N triplets i.e. a degenerate N N N sequence.

In another aspect the present invention provides for the use of degenerate cassettes having less degeneracy than the N N N sequence. For example it may be desirable in some instances to use e.g. in an oligo a degenerate triplet sequence comprised of only one N where the N can be in the first second or third position of the triplet. Any other bases including any combinations and permutations thereof can be used in the remaining two positions of the triplet. Alternatively it may be desirable in some instances to use e.g. in an oligo a degenerate N N N triplet sequence N N G T or an N N G C triplet sequence.

It is appreciated however that the use of a degenerate triplet such as N N G T or an N N G C triplet sequence as disclosed in the instant invention is advantageous for several reasons. In one aspect this invention provides a means to systematically and fairly easily generate the substitution of the full range of possible amino acids for a total of 20 amino acids into each and every amino acid position in a polypeptide. Thus for a 100 amino acid polypeptide the invention provides a way to systematically and fairly easily generate 2000 distinct species i.e. 20 possible amino acids per position times 100 amino acid positions . It is appreciated that there is provided through the use of an oligo containing a degenerate N N G T or an N N G C triplet sequence 32 individual sequences that code for 20 possible amino acids. Thus in a reaction vessel in which a parental polynucleotide sequence is subjected to saturation mutagenesis using one such oligo there are generated 32 distinct progeny polynucleotides encoding 20 distinct polypeptides. In contrast the use of a non degenerate oligo in site directed mutagenesis leads to only one progeny polypeptide product per reaction vessel.

This invention also provides for the use of nondegenerate oligos which can optionally be used in combination with degenerate primers disclosed. It is appreciated that in some situations it is advantageous to use nondegenerate oligos to generate specific point mutations in a working polynucleotide. This provides a means to generate specific silent point mutations point mutations leading to corresponding amino acid changes and point mutations that cause the generation of stop codons and the corresponding expression of polypeptide fragments.

Thus in one aspect of this invention each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel contains polynucleotides encoding at least 20 progeny polypeptide molecules such that all 20 amino acids are represented at the one specific amino acid position corresponding to the codon position mutagenized in the parental polynucleotide. The 32 fold degenerate progeny polypeptides generated from each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel can be subjected to clonal amplification e.g. cloned into a suitable host using an expression vector and subjected to expression screening. When an individual progeny polypeptide is identified by screening to display a favorable change in property when compared to the parental polypeptide it can be sequenced to identify the correspondingly favorable amino acid substitution contained therein.

It is appreciated that upon mutagenizing each and every amino acid position in a parental polypeptide using saturation mutagenesis as disclosed herein favorable amino acid changes may be identified at more than one amino acid position. One or more new progeny molecules can be generated that contain a combination of all or part of these favorable amino acid substitutions. For example if 2 specific favorable amino acid changes are identified in each of 3 amino acid positions in a polypeptide the permutations include 3 possibilities at each position no change from the original amino acid and each of two favorable changes and 3 positions. Thus there are 3 3 3 or 27 total possibilities including 7 that were previously examined 6 single point mutations i.e. 2 at each of three positions and no change at any position.

Thus in a non limiting exemplification this invention provides for the use of saturation mutagenesis in combination with additional mutagenization processes such as process where two or more related polynucleotides are introduced into a suitable host cell such that a hybrid polynucleotide is generated by recombination and reductive reassortment.

In addition to performing mutagenesis along the entire sequence of a gene the instant invention provides that mutagenesis can be use to replace each of any number of bases in a polynucleotide sequence wherein the number of bases to be mutagenized is in one aspect every integer from 15 to 100 000. Thus instead of mutagenizing every position along a molecule one can subject every or a discrete number of bases in one aspect a subset totaling from 15 to 100 000 to mutagenesis. In one aspect a separate nucleotide is used for mutagenizing each position or group of positions along a polynucleotide sequence. A group of 3 positions to be mutagenized may be a codon. The mutations can be introduced using a mutagenic primer containing a heterologous cassette also referred to as a mutagenic cassette. Exemplary cassettes can have from 1 to 500 bases. Each nucleotide position in such heterologous cassettes be N A C G T A C A G A T C G C T G T C G T A G T A C T A C G or E where E is any base that is not A C G or T E can be referred to as a designer oligo .

In a general sense saturation mutagenesis is comprised of mutagenizing a complete set of mutagenic cassettes wherein each cassette is in one aspect about 1 500 bases in length in defined polynucleotide sequence to be mutagenized wherein the sequence to be mutagenized is in one aspect from about 15 to 100 000 bases in length . Thus a group of mutations ranging from 1 to 100 mutations is introduced into each cassette to be mutagenized. A grouping of mutations to be introduced into one cassette can be different or the same from a second grouping of mutations to be introduced into a second cassette during the application of one round of saturation mutagenesis. Such groupings are exemplified by deletions additions groupings of particular codons and groupings of particular nucleotide cassettes.

Defined sequences to be mutagenized include a whole gene pathway cDNA an entire open reading frame ORF and entire promoter enhancer repressor transactivator origin of replication intron operator or any polynucleotide functional group. Generally a defined sequences for this purpose may be any polynucleotide that a 15 base polynucleotide sequence and polynucleotide sequences of lengths between 15 bases and 15 000 bases this invention specifically names every integer in between . Considerations in choosing groupings of codons include types of amino acids encoded by a degenerate mutagenic cassette.

In one exemplification a grouping of mutations that can be introduced into a mutagenic cassette this invention specifically provides for degenerate codon substitutions using degenerate oligos that code for 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 amino acids at each position and a library of polypeptides encoded thereby.

The invention provides a non stochastic gene modification system termed synthetic ligation reassembly or simply SLR a directed evolution process to generate polypeptides e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or antibodies of the invention with new or altered properties. SLR is a method of ligating oligonucleotide fragments together non stochastically. This method differs from stochastic oligonucleotide shuffling in that the nucleic acid building blocks are not shuffled concatenated or chimerized randomly but rather are assembled non stochastically. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 773 900 6 740 506 6 713 282 6 635 449 6 605 449 6 537 776.

In one aspect SLR comprises the following steps a providing a template polynucleotide wherein the template polynucleotide comprises sequence encoding a homologous gene b providing a plurality of building block polynucleotides wherein the building block polynucleotides are designed to cross over reassemble with the template polynucleotide at a predetermined sequence and a building block polynucleotide comprises a sequence that is a variant of the homologous gene and a sequence homologous to the template polynucleotide flanking the variant sequence c combining a building block polynucleotide with a template polynucleotide such that the building block polynucleotide cross over reassembles with the template polynucleotide to generate polynucleotides comprising homologous gene sequence variations.

SLR does not depend on the presence of high levels of homology between polynucleotides to be rearranged. Thus this method can be used to non stochastically generate libraries or sets of progeny molecules comprised of over 10different chimeras. SLR can be used to generate libraries comprised of over 10different progeny chimeras. Thus aspects of the present invention include non stochastic methods of producing a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecule shaving an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. This method includes the steps of generating by design a plurality of specific nucleic acid building blocks having serviceable mutually compatible ligatable ends and assembling these nucleic acid building blocks such that a designed overall assembly order is achieved.

The mutually compatible ligatable ends of the nucleic acid building blocks to be assembled are considered to be serviceable for this type of ordered assembly if they enable the building blocks to be coupled in predetermined orders. Thus the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is specified by the design of the ligatable ends. If more than one assembly step is to be used then the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is also specified by the sequential order of the assembly step s . In one aspect the annealed building pieces are treated with an enzyme such as a ligase e.g. T4 DNA ligase to achieve covalent bonding of the building pieces.

In one aspect the design of the oligonucleotide building blocks is obtained by analyzing a set of progenitor nucleic acid sequence templates that serve as a basis for producing a progeny set of finalized chimeric polynucleotides. These parental oligonucleotide templates thus serve as a source of sequence information that aids in the design of the nucleic acid building blocks that are to be mutagenized e.g. chimerized or shuffled. In one aspect of this method the sequences of a plurality of parental nucleic acid templates are aligned in order to select one or more demarcation points. The demarcation points can be located at an area of homology and are comprised of one or more nucleotides. These demarcation points are in one aspect shared by at least two of the progenitor templates. The demarcation points can thereby be used to delineate the boundaries of oligonucleotide building blocks to be generated in order to rearrange the parental polynucleotides. The demarcation points identified and selected in the progenitor molecules serve as potential chimerization points in the assembly of the final chimeric progeny molecules. A demarcation point can be an area of homology comprised of at least one homologous nucleotide base shared by at least two parental polynucleotide sequences. Alternatively a demarcation point can be an area of homology that is shared by at least half of the parental polynucleotide sequences or it can be an area of homology that is shared by at least two thirds of the parental polynucleotide sequences. Even more in one aspect a serviceable demarcation points is an area of homology that is shared by at least three fourths of the parental polynucleotide sequences or it can be shared by at almost all of the parental polynucleotide sequences. In one aspect a demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by all of the parental polynucleotide sequences.

In one aspect a ligation reassembly process is performed exhaustively in order to generate an exhaustive library of progeny chimeric polynucleotides. In other words all possible ordered combinations of the nucleic acid building blocks are represented in the set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. At the same time in another aspect the assembly order i.e. the order of assembly of each building block in the 5 to 3 sequence of each finalized chimeric nucleic acid in each combination is by design or non stochastic as described above. Because of the non stochastic nature of this invention the possibility of unwanted side products is greatly reduced.

In another aspect the ligation reassembly method is performed systematically. For example the method is performed in order to generate a systematically compartmentalized library of progeny molecules with compartments that can be screened systematically e.g. one by one. In other words this invention provides that through the selective and judicious use of specific nucleic acid building blocks coupled with the selective and judicious use of sequentially stepped assembly reactions a design can be achieved where specific sets of progeny products are made in each of several reaction vessels. This allows a systematic examination and screening procedure to be performed. Thus these methods allow a potentially very large number of progeny molecules to be examined systematically in smaller groups. Because of its ability to perform chimerizations in a manner that is highly flexible yet exhaustive and systematic as well particularly when there is a low level of homology among the progenitor molecules these methods provide for the generation of a library or set comprised of a large number of progeny molecules. Because of the non stochastic nature of the instant ligation reassembly invention the progeny molecules generated in one aspect comprise a library of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. The saturation mutagenesis and optimized directed evolution methods also can be used to generate different progeny molecular species. It is appreciated that the invention provides freedom of choice and control regarding the selection of demarcation points the size and number of the nucleic acid building blocks and the size and design of the couplings. It is appreciated furthermore that the requirement for intermolecular homology is highly relaxed for the operability of this invention. In fact demarcation points can even be chosen in areas of little or no intermolecular homology. For example because of codon wobble i.e. the degeneracy of codons nucleotide substitutions can be introduced into nucleic acid building blocks without altering the amino acid originally encoded in the corresponding progenitor template. Alternatively a codon can be altered such that the coding for an originally amino acid is altered. This invention provides that such substitutions can be introduced into the nucleic acid building block in order to increase the incidence of intermolecular homologous demarcation points and thus to allow an increased number of couplings to be achieved among the building blocks which in turn allows a greater number of progeny chimeric molecules to be generated.

In one aspect the present invention provides a non stochastic method termed synthetic gene reassembly that is somewhat related to stochastic shuffling save that the nucleic acid building blocks are not shuffled or concatenated or chimerized randomly but rather are assembled non stochastically.

The synthetic gene reassembly method does not depend on the presence of a high level of homology between polynucleotides to be shuffled. The invention can be used to non stochastically generate libraries or sets of progeny molecules comprised of over 10different chimeras. Conceivably synthetic gene reassembly can even be used to generate libraries comprised of over 10different progeny chimeras.

Thus in one aspect the invention provides a non stochastic method of producing a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design which method is comprised of the steps of generating by design a plurality of specific nucleic acid building blocks having serviceable mutually compatible ligatable ends and assembling these nucleic acid building blocks such that a designed overall assembly order is achieved.

The mutually compatible ligatable ends of the nucleic acid building blocks to be assembled are considered to be serviceable for this type of ordered assembly if they enable the building blocks to be coupled in predetermined orders. Thus in one aspect the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is specified by the design of the ligatable ends and if more than one assembly step is to be used then the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is also specified by the sequential order of the assembly step s . In a one aspect of the invention the annealed building pieces are treated with an enzyme such as a ligase e.g. T4 DNA ligase to achieve covalent bonding of the building pieces.

In a another aspect the design of nucleic acid building blocks is obtained upon analysis of the sequences of a set of progenitor nucleic acid templates that serve as a basis for producing a progeny set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. These progenitor nucleic acid templates thus serve as a source of sequence information that aids in the design of the nucleic acid building blocks that are to be mutagenized i.e. chimerized or shuffled.

In one exemplification the invention provides for the chimerization of a family of related genes and their encoded family of related products. In a particular exemplification the encoded products are enzymes. The polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins of the present invention can be mutagenized in accordance with the methods described herein.

Thus according to one aspect of the invention the sequences of a plurality of progenitor nucleic acid templates e.g. polynucleotides of the invention are aligned in order to select one or more demarcation points which demarcation points can be located at an area of homology. The demarcation points can be used to delineate the boundaries of nucleic acid building blocks to be generated. Thus the demarcation points identified and selected in the progenitor molecules serve as potential chimerization points in the assembly of the progeny molecules.

Typically a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology comprised of at least one homologous nucleotide base shared by at least two progenitor templates but the demarcation point can be an area of homology that is shared by at least half of the progenitor templates at least two thirds of the progenitor templates at least three fourths of the progenitor templates and in one aspect at almost all of the progenitor templates. Even more in one aspect still a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by all of the progenitor templates.

In a one aspect the gene reassembly process is performed exhaustively in order to generate an exhaustive library. In other words all possible ordered combinations of the nucleic acid building blocks are represented in the set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. At the same time the assembly order i.e. the order of assembly of each building block in the 5 to 3 sequence of each finalized chimeric nucleic acid in each combination is by design or non stochastic . Because of the non stochastic nature of the method the possibility of unwanted side products is greatly reduced.

In another aspect the method provides that the gene reassembly process is performed systematically for example to generate a systematically compartmentalized library with compartments that can be screened systematically e.g. one by one. In other words the invention provides that through the selective and judicious use of specific nucleic acid building blocks coupled with the selective and judicious use of sequentially stepped assembly reactions an experimental design can be achieved where specific sets of progeny products are made in each of several reaction vessels. This allows a systematic examination and screening procedure to be performed. Thus it allows a potentially very large number of progeny molecules to be examined systematically in smaller groups.

Because of its ability to perform chimerizations in a manner that is highly flexible yet exhaustive and systematic as well particularly when there is a low level of homology among the progenitor molecules the instant invention provides for the generation of a library or set comprised of a large number of progeny molecules. Because of the non stochastic nature of the instant gene reassembly invention the progeny molecules generated in one aspect comprise a library of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. In a particularly aspect such a generated library is comprised of greater than 10to greater than 10different progeny molecular species.

In one aspect a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules produced as described is comprised of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. According to one aspect this polynucleotide is a gene which may be a man made gene. According to another aspect this polynucleotide is a gene pathway which may be a man made gene pathway. The invention provides that one or more man made genes generated by the invention may be incorporated into a man made gene pathway such as pathway operable in a eukaryotic organism including a plant .

In another exemplification the synthetic nature of the step in which the building blocks are generated allows the design and introduction of nucleotides e.g. one or more nucleotides which may be for example codons or introns or regulatory sequences that can later be optionally removed in an in vitro process e.g. by mutagenesis or in an in vivo process e.g. by utilizing the gene splicing ability of a host organism . It is appreciated that in many instances the introduction of these nucleotides may also be desirable for many other reasons in addition to the potential benefit of creating a serviceable demarcation point.

Thus according to another aspect the invention provides that a nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce an intron. Thus the invention provides that functional introns may be introduced into a man made gene of the invention. The invention also provides that functional introns may be introduced into a man made gene pathway of the invention. Accordingly the invention provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man made gene containing one or more artificially introduced intron s .

Accordingly the invention also provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man made gene pathway containing one or more artificially introduced intron s . In one aspect the artificially introduced intron s are functional in one or more host cells for gene splicing much in the way that naturally occurring introns serve functionally in gene splicing. The invention provides a process of producing man made intron containing polynucleotides to be introduced into host organisms for recombination and or splicing.

A man made gene produced using the invention can also serve as a substrate for recombination with another nucleic acid. Likewise a man made gene pathway produced using the invention can also serve as a substrate for recombination with another nucleic acid. In one aspect the recombination is facilitated by or occurs at areas of homology between the man made intron containing gene and a nucleic acid which serves as a recombination partner. In one aspect the recombination partner may also be a nucleic acid generated by the invention including a man made gene or a man made gene pathway. Recombination may be facilitated by or may occur at areas of homology that exist at the one or more artificially introduced intron s in the man made gene.

The synthetic gene reassembly method of the invention utilizes a plurality of nucleic acid building blocks each of which in one aspect has two ligatable ends. The two ligatable ends on each nucleic acid building block may be two blunt ends i.e. each having an overhang of zero nucleotides or in one aspect one blunt end and one overhang or more in one aspect still two overhangs.

A useful overhang for this purpose may be a 3 overhang or a 5 overhang. Thus a nucleic acid building block may have a 3 overhang or alternatively a 5 overhang or alternatively two 3 overhangs or alternatively two 5 overhangs. The overall order in which the nucleic acid building blocks are assembled to form a finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecule is determined by purposeful experimental design and is not random.

In one aspect a nucleic acid building block is generated by chemical synthesis of two single stranded nucleic acids also referred to as single stranded oligos and contacting them so as to allow them to anneal to form a double stranded nucleic acid building block.

A double stranded nucleic acid building block can be of variable size. The sizes of these building blocks can be small or large. Exemplary sizes for building block range from 1 base pair not including any overhangs to 100 000 base pairs not including any overhangs . Other exemplary size ranges are also provided which have lower limits of from 1 bp to 10 000 bp including every integer value in between and upper limits of from 2 bp to 100 000 bp including every integer value in between .

Many methods exist by which a double stranded nucleic acid building block can be generated that is serviceable for the invention and these are known in the art and can be readily performed by the skilled artisan.

According to one aspect a double stranded nucleic acid building block is generated by first generating two single stranded nucleic acids and allowing them to anneal to form a double stranded nucleic acid building block. The two strands of a double stranded nucleic acid building block may be complementary at every nucleotide apart from any that form an overhang thus containing no mismatches apart from any overhang s . According to another aspect the two strands of a double stranded nucleic acid building block are complementary at fewer than every nucleotide apart from any that form an overhang. Thus according to this aspect a double stranded nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce codon degeneracy. In one aspect the codon degeneracy is introduced using the site saturation mutagenesis described herein using one or more N N G T cassettes or alternatively using one or more N N N cassettes.

The in vivo recombination method of the invention can be performed blindly on a pool of unknown hybrids or alleles of a specific polynucleotide or sequence. However it is not necessary to know the actual DNA or RNA sequence of the specific polynucleotide.

The approach of using recombination within a mixed population of genes can be useful for the generation of any useful proteins for example interleukin I antibodies tPA and growth hormone. This approach may be used to generate proteins having altered specificity or activity. The approach may also be useful for the generation of hybrid nucleic acid sequences for example promoter regions introns exons enhancer sequences 31 untranslated regions or 51 untranslated regions of genes. Thus this approach may be used to generate genes having increased rates of expression. This approach may also be useful in the study of repetitive DNA sequences. Finally this approach may be useful to mutate ribozymes or aptamers.

In one aspect the invention described herein is directed to the use of repeated cycles of reductive reassortment recombination and selection which allow for the directed molecular evolution of highly complex linear sequences such as DNA RNA or proteins thorough recombination.

The invention provides a non stochastic gene modification system termed optimized directed evolution system to generate polypeptides e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or antibodies of the invention with new or altered properties. Optimized directed evolution is directed to the use of repeated cycles of reductive reassortment recombination and selection that allow for the directed molecular evolution of nucleic acids through recombination. Optimized directed evolution allows generation of a large population of evolved chimeric sequences wherein the generated population is significantly enriched for sequences that have a predetermined number of crossover events.

A crossover event is a point in a chimeric sequence where a shift in sequence occurs from one parental variant to another parental variant. Such a point is normally at the juncture of where oligonucleotides from two parents are ligated together to form a single sequence. This method allows calculation of the correct concentrations of oligonucleotide sequences so that the final chimeric population of sequences is enriched for the chosen number of crossover events. This provides more control over choosing chimeric variants having a predetermined number of crossover events.

In addition this method provides a convenient means for exploring a tremendous amount of the possible protein variant space in comparison to other systems. Previously if one generated for example 10chimeric molecules during a reaction it would be extremely difficult to test such a high number of chimeric variants for a particular activity. Moreover a significant portion of the progeny population would have a very high number of crossover events which resulted in proteins that were less likely to have increased levels of a particular activity. By using these methods the population of chimerics molecules can be enriched for those variants that have a particular number of crossover events. Thus although one can still generate 10chimeric molecules during a reaction each of the molecules chosen for further analysis most likely has for example only three crossover events. Because the resulting progeny population can be skewed to have a predetermined number of crossover events the boundaries on the functional variety between the chimeric molecules is reduced. This provides a more manageable number of variables when calculating which oligonucleotide from the original parental polynucleotides might be responsible for affecting a particular trait.

One method for creating a chimeric progeny polynucleotide sequence is to create oligonucleotides corresponding to fragments or portions of each parental sequence. Each oligonucleotide in one aspect includes a unique region of overlap so that mixing the oligonucleotides together results in a new variant that has each oligonucleotide fragment assembled in the correct order. Alternatively protocols for practicing these methods of the invention can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 773 900 6 740 506 6 713 282 6 635 449 6 605 449 6 537 776 6 361 974.

The number of oligonucleotides generated for each parental variant bears a relationship to the total number of resulting crossovers in the chimeric molecule that is ultimately created. For example three parental nucleotide sequence variants might be provided to undergo a ligation reaction in order to find a chimeric variant having for example greater activity at high temperature. As one example a set of 50 oligonucleotide sequences can be generated corresponding to each portions of each parental variant. Accordingly during the ligation reassembly process there could be up to 50 crossover events within each of the chimeric sequences. The probability that each of the generated chimeric polynucleotides will contain oligonucleotides from each parental variant in alternating order is very low. If each oligonucleotide fragment is present in the ligation reaction in the same molar quantity it is likely that in some positions oligonucleotides from the same parental polynucleotide will ligate next to one another and thus not result in a crossover event. If the concentration of each oligonucleotide from each parent is kept constant during any ligation step in this example there is a chance assuming 3 parents that an oligonucleotide from the same parental variant will ligate within the chimeric sequence and produce no crossover.

Accordingly a probability density function PDF can be determined to predict the population of crossover events that are likely to occur during each step in a ligation reaction given a set number of parental variants a number of oligonucleotides corresponding to each variant and the concentrations of each variant during each step in the ligation reaction. The statistics and mathematics behind determining the PDF is described below. By utilizing these methods one can calculate such a probability density function and thus enrich the chimeric progeny population for a predetermined number of crossover events resulting from a particular ligation reaction. Moreover a target number of crossover events can be predetermined and the system then programmed to calculate the starting quantities of each parental oligonucleotide during each step in the ligation reaction to result in a probability density function that centers on the predetermined number of crossover events. These methods are directed to the use of repeated cycles of reductive reassortment recombination and selection that allow for the directed molecular evolution of a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide through recombination. This system allows generation of a large population of evolved chimeric sequences wherein the generated population is significantly enriched for sequences that have a predetermined number of crossover events. A crossover event is a point in a chimeric sequence where a shift in sequence occurs from one parental variant to another parental variant. Such a point is normally at the juncture of where oligonucleotides from two parents are ligated together to form a single sequence. The method allows calculation of the correct concentrations of oligonucleotide sequences so that the final chimeric population of sequences is enriched for the chosen number of crossover events. This provides more control over choosing chimeric variants having a predetermined number of crossover events.

In addition these methods provide a convenient means for exploring a tremendous amount of the possible protein variant space in comparison to other systems. By using the methods described herein the population of chimerics molecules can be enriched for those variants that have a particular number of crossover events. Thus although one can still generate 10chimeric molecules during a reaction each of the molecules chosen for further analysis most likely has for example only three crossover events. Because the resulting progeny population can be skewed to have a predetermined number of crossover events the boundaries on the functional variety between the chimeric molecules is reduced. This provides a more manageable number of variables when calculating which oligonucleotide from the original parental polynucleotides might be responsible for affecting a particular trait.

In one aspect the method creates a chimeric progeny polynucleotide sequence by creating oligonucleotides corresponding to fragments or portions of each parental sequence. Each oligonucleotide in one aspect includes a unique region of overlap so that mixing the oligonucleotides together results in a new variant that has each oligonucleotide fragment assembled in the correct order. See also U.S. Ser. No. 09 332 835.

Aspects of the invention include a system and software that receive a desired crossover probability density function PDF the number of parent genes to be reassembled and the number of fragments in the reassembly as inputs. The output of this program is a fragment PDF that can be used to determine a recipe for producing reassembled genes and the estimated crossover PDF of those genes. The processing described herein is in one aspect performed in MATLAB The Mathworks Natick Mass. a programming language and development environment for technical computing.

In practicing the invention these processes can be iteratively repeated. For example a nucleic acid or the nucleic acid responsible for an altered or new a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein phenotype is identified re isolated again modified re tested for activity. This process can be iteratively repeated until a desired phenotype is engineered. For example an entire biochemical anabolic or catabolic pathway can be engineered into a cell including e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity.

Similarly if it is determined that a particular oligonucleotide has no affect at all on the desired trait e.g. a new a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein phenotype it can be removed as a variable by synthesizing larger parental oligonucleotides that include the sequence to be removed. Since incorporating the sequence within a larger sequence prevents any crossover events there will no longer be any variation of this sequence in the progeny polynucleotides. This iterative practice of determining which oligonucleotides are most related to the desired trait and which are unrelated allows more efficient exploration all of the possible protein variants that might be provide a particular trait or activity.

In vivo shuffling of molecules is use in methods of the invention that provide variants of polypeptides of the invention e.g. antibodies a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein and the like. In vivo shuffling can be performed utilizing the natural property of cells to recombine multimers. While recombination in vivo has provided the major natural route to molecular diversity genetic recombination remains a relatively complex process that involves 1 the recognition of homologies 2 strand cleavage strand invasion and metabolic steps leading to the production of recombinant chiasma and finally 3 the resolution of chiasma into discrete recombined molecules. The formation of the chiasma requires the recognition of homologous sequences.

In another aspect the invention includes a method for producing a hybrid polynucleotide from at least a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide. The invention can be used to produce a hybrid polynucleotide by introducing at least a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide e.g. one or both being an exemplary polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein encoding sequence of the invention which share at least one region of partial sequence homology into a suitable host cell. The regions of partial sequence homology promote processes which result in sequence reorganization producing a hybrid polynucleotide. The term hybrid polynucleotide as used herein is any nucleotide sequence which results from the method of the present invention and contains sequence from at least two original polynucleotide sequences. Such hybrid polynucleotides can result from intermolecular recombination events which promote sequence integration between DNA molecules. In addition such hybrid polynucleotides can result from intramolecular reductive reassortment processes which utilize repeated sequences to alter a nucleotide sequence within a DNA molecule.

In vivo reassortment is focused on inter molecular processes collectively referred to as recombination which in bacteria is generally viewed as a RecA dependent phenomenon. The invention can rely on recombination processes of a host cell to recombine and re assort sequences or the cells ability to mediate reductive processes to decrease the complexity of quasi repeated sequences in the cell by deletion. This process of reductive reassortment occurs by an intra molecular RecA independent process.

Therefore in another aspect of the invention novel polynucleotides can be generated by the process of reductive reassortment. The method involves the generation of constructs containing consecutive sequences original encoding sequences their insertion into an appropriate vector and their subsequent introduction into an appropriate host cell. The reassortment of the individual molecular identities occurs by combinatorial processes between the consecutive sequences in the construct possessing regions of homology or between quasi repeated units. The reassortment process recombines and or reduces the complexity and extent of the repeated sequences and results in the production of novel molecular species. Various treatments may be applied to enhance the rate of reassortment. These could include treatment with ultra violet light or DNA damaging chemicals and or the use of host cell lines displaying enhanced levels of genetic instability . Thus the reassortment process may involve homologous recombination or the natural property of quasi repeated sequences to direct their own evolution.

Repeated or quasi repeated sequences play a role in genetic instability. In the present invention quasi repeats are repeats that are not restricted to their original unit structure. Quasi repeated units can be presented as an array of sequences in a construct consecutive units of similar sequences. Once ligated the junctions between the consecutive sequences become essentially invisible and the quasi repetitive nature of the resulting construct is now continuous at the molecular level. The deletion process the cell performs to reduce the complexity of the resulting construct operates between the quasi repeated sequences. The quasi repeated units provide a practically limitless repertoire of templates upon which slippage events can occur. The constructs containing the quasi repeats thus effectively provide sufficient molecular elasticity that deletion and potentially insertion events can occur virtually anywhere within the quasi repetitive units.

When the quasi repeated sequences are all ligated in the same orientation for instance head to tail or vice versa the cell cannot distinguish individual units. Consequently the reductive process can occur throughout the sequences. In contrast when for example the units are presented head to head rather than head to tail the inversion delineates the endpoints of the adjacent unit so that deletion formation will favor the loss of discrete units. Thus it is preferable with the present method that the sequences are in the same orientation. Random orientation of quasi repeated sequences will result in the loss of reassortment efficiency while consistent orientation of the sequences will offer the highest efficiency. However while having fewer of the contiguous sequences in the same orientation decreases the efficiency it may still provide sufficient elasticity for the effective recovery of novel molecules. Constructs can be made with the quasi repeated sequences in the same orientation to allow higher efficiency.

Sequences can be assembled in a head to tail orientation using any of a variety of methods including the following 

The recovery of the re assorted sequences relies on the identification of cloning vectors with a reduced repetitive index RI . The re assorted encoding sequences can then be recovered by amplification. The products are re cloned and expressed. The recovery of cloning vectors with reduced RI can be affected by 

Encoding sequences for example genes from related organisms may demonstrate a high degree of homology and encode quite diverse protein products. These types of sequences are particularly useful in the present invention as quasi repeats. However while the examples illustrated below demonstrate the reassortment of nearly identical original encoding sequences quasi repeats this process is not limited to such nearly identical repeats.

The following example demonstrates a method of the invention. Encoding nucleic acid sequences quasi repeats derived from three 3 unique species are described. Each sequence encodes a protein with a distinct set of properties. Each of the sequences differs by a single or a few base pairs at a unique position in the sequence. The quasi repeated sequences are separately or collectively amplified and ligated into random assemblies such that all possible permutations and combinations are available in the population of ligated molecules. The number of quasi repeat units can be controlled by the assembly conditions. The average number of quasi repeated units in a construct is defined as the repetitive index RI .

Once formed the constructs may or may not be size fractionated on an agarose gel according to published protocols inserted into a cloning vector and transfected into an appropriate host cell. The cells are then propagated and reductive reassortment is effected. The rate of the reductive reassortment process may be stimulated by the introduction of DNA damage if desired. Whether the reduction in RI is mediated by deletion formation between repeated sequences by an intra molecular mechanism or mediated by recombination like events through inter molecular mechanisms is immaterial. The end result is a reassortment of the molecules into all possible combinations.

Optionally the method comprises the additional step of screening the library members of the shuffled pool to identify individual shuffled library members having the ability to bind or otherwise interact or catalyze a particular reaction e.g. such as catalytic domain of an enzyme with a predetermined macromolecule such as for example a proteinaceous receptor an oligosaccharide virion or other predetermined compound or structure.

The polypeptides that are identified from such libraries can be used for therapeutic diagnostic research and related purposes e.g. catalysts solutes for increasing osmolarity of an aqueous solution and the like and or can be subjected to one or more additional cycles of shuffling and or selection.

In another aspect it is envisioned that prior to or during recombination or reassortment polynucleotides generated by the method of the invention can be subjected to agents or processes which promote the introduction of mutations into the original polynucleotides. The introduction of such mutations would increase the diversity of resulting hybrid polynucleotides and polypeptides encoded therefrom. The agents or processes which promote mutagenesis can include but are not limited to CC 1065 or a synthetic analog such as CC 1065 N3 Adenine See Sun and Hurley 1992 an N acetylated or deacetylated 4 fluoro 4 aminobiphenyl adduct capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis See for example van de Poll et al. 1992 or a N acetylated or deacetylated 4 aminobiphenyl adduct capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis See also van de Poll et al. 1992 pp. 751 758 trivalent chromium a trivalent chromium salt a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH DNA adduct capable of inhibiting DNA replication such as 7 bromomethyl benz a anthracene BMA tris 2 3 dibromopropyl phosphate Tris BP 1 2 dibromo 3 chloropropane DBCP 2 bromoacrolein 2BA benzo a pyrene 7 8 dihydrodiol 9 10 epoxide BPDE a platinum II halogen salt N hydroxy 2 amino 3 methylimidazo 4 5 f quinoline N hydroxy IQ and N hydroxy 2 amino 1 methyl 6 phenylimidazo 4 5 f pyridine N hydroxy PhIP . Exemplary means for slowing or halting PCR amplification consist of UV light CC 1065 and CC 1065 N3 Adenine . Particularly encompassed means are DNA adducts or polynucleotides comprising the DNA adducts from the polynucleotides or polynucleotides pool which can be released or removed by a process including heating the solution comprising the polynucleotides prior to further processing.

In another aspect the invention is directed to a method of producing recombinant proteins having biological activity by treating a sample comprising double stranded template polynucleotides encoding a wild type protein under conditions according to the invention which provide for the production of hybrid or re assorted polynucleotides.

The invention also provides additional methods for making sequence variants of the nucleic acid e.g. polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein sequences of the invention. The invention also provides additional methods for isolating a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein using the nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention. In one aspect the invention provides for variants of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein coding sequence e.g. a gene cDNA or message of the invention which can be altered by any means including e.g. random or stochastic methods or non stochastic or directed evolution methods as described above.

The isolated variants may be naturally occurring. Variant can also be created in vitro. Variants may be created using genetic engineering techniques such as site directed mutagenesis random chemical mutagenesis Exonuclease III deletion procedures and standard cloning techniques. Alternatively such variants fragments analogs or derivatives may be created using chemical synthesis or modification procedures. Other methods of making variants are also familiar to those skilled in the art. These include procedures in which nucleic acid sequences obtained from natural isolates are modified to generate nucleic acids which encode polypeptides having characteristics which enhance their value in industrial or laboratory applications. In such procedures a large number of variant sequences having one or more nucleotide differences with respect to the sequence obtained from the natural isolate are generated and characterized. These nucleotide differences can result in amino acid changes with respect to the polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acids from the natural isolates.

For example variants may be created using error prone PCR. In error prone PCR PCR is performed under conditions where the copying fidelity of the DNA polymerase is low such that a high rate of point mutations is obtained along the entire length of the PCR product. Error prone PCR is described e.g. in Leung 1989 Technique 1 11 15 and Caldwell 1992 PCR Methods Applic. 2 28 33. Briefly in such procedures nucleic acids to be mutagenized are mixed with PCR primers reaction buffer MgCl MnCl Taq polymerase and an appropriate concentration of dNTPs for achieving a high rate of point mutation along the entire length of the PCR product. For example the reaction may be performed using 20 moles of nucleic acid to be mutagenized 30 pmole of each PCR primer a reaction buffer comprising 50 mM KCl 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.3 and 0.01 gelatin 7 mM MgCl2 0.5 mM MnCl 5 units of Taq polymerase 0.2 mM dGTP 0.2 mM dATP 1 mM dCTP and 1 mM dTTP. PCR may be performed for 30 cycles of 94 C. for 1 min 45 C. for 1 min and 72 C. for 1 min. However it will be appreciated that these parameters may be varied as appropriate. The mutagenized nucleic acids are cloned into an appropriate vector and the activities of the polypeptides encoded by the mutagenized nucleic acids are evaluated.

Variants may also be created using oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis to generate site specific mutations in any cloned DNA of interest. Oligonucleotide mutagenesis is described e.g. in Reidhaar Olson 1988 Science 241 53 57. Briefly in such procedures a plurality of double stranded oligonucleotides bearing one or more mutations to be introduced into the cloned DNA are synthesized and inserted into the cloned DNA to be mutagenized. Clones containing the mutagenized DNA are recovered and the activities of the polypeptides they encode are assessed.

Another method for generating variants is assembly PCR. Assembly PCR involves the assembly of a PCR product from a mixture of small DNA fragments. A large number of different PCR reactions occur in parallel in the same vial with the products of one reaction priming the products of another reaction. Assembly PCR is described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 965 408.

Still another method of generating variants is sexual PCR mutagenesis. In sexual PCR mutagenesis forced homologous recombination occurs between DNA molecules of different but highly related DNA sequence in vitro as a result of random fragmentation of the DNA molecule based on sequence homology followed by fixation of the crossover by primer extension in a PCR reaction. Sexual PCR mutagenesis is described e.g. in Stemmer 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 10747 10751. Briefly in such procedures a plurality of nucleic acids to be recombined are digested with DNase to generate fragments having an average size of 50 200 nucleotides. Fragments of the desired average size are purified and resuspended in a PCR mixture. PCR is conducted under conditions which facilitate recombination between the nucleic acid fragments. For example PCR may be performed by resuspending the purified fragments at a concentration of 10 30 ng l in a solution of 0.2 mM of each dNTP 2.2 mM MgCl 50 mM KCL 10 mM Tris HCl pH 9.0 and 0.1 Triton X 100. 2.5 units of Taq polymerase per 100 1 of reaction mixture is added and PCR is performed using the following regime 94 C. for 60 seconds 94 C. for 30 seconds 50 55 C. for 30 seconds 72 C. for 30 seconds 30 45 times and 72 C. for 5 minutes. However it will be appreciated that these parameters may be varied as appropriate. In some aspects oligonucleotides may be included in the PCR reactions. In other aspects the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I may be used in a first set of PCR reactions and Taq polymerase may be used in a subsequent set of PCR reactions. Recombinant sequences are isolated and the activities of the polypeptides they encode are assessed.

Variants may also be created by in vivo mutagenesis. In some aspects random mutations in a sequence of interest are generated by propagating the sequence of interest in a bacterial strain such as an strain which carries mutations in one or more of the DNA repair pathways. Such mutator strains have a higher random mutation rate than that of a wild type parent. Propagating the DNA in one of these strains will eventually generate random mutations within the DNA. Mutator strains suitable for use for in vivo mutagenesis are described in PCT Publication No. WO 91 16427 published Oct. 31 1991 entitled Methods for Phenotype Creation from Multiple Gene Populations .

Variants may also be generated using cassette mutagenesis. In cassette mutagenesis a small region of a double stranded DNA molecule is replaced with a synthetic oligonucleotide cassette that differs from the native sequence. The oligonucleotide often contains completely and or partially randomized native sequence.

Recursive ensemble mutagenesis may also be used to generate variants. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis is an algorithm for protein engineering protein mutagenesis developed to produce diverse populations of phenotypically related mutants whose members differ in amino acid sequence. This method uses a feedback mechanism to control successive rounds of combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis is described e.g. in Arkin 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 7811 7815.

In some aspects variants are created using exponential ensemble mutagenesis. Exponential ensemble mutagenesis is a process for generating combinatorial libraries with a high percentage of unique and functional mutants wherein small groups of residues are randomized in parallel to identify at each altered position amino acids which lead to functional proteins. Exponential ensemble mutagenesis is described e.g. in Delegrave 1993 Biotechnology Res. 11 1548 1552. Random and site directed mutagenesis are described e.g. in Arnold 1993 Current Opinion in Biotechnology 4 450 455.

In some aspects the variants are created using shuffling procedures wherein portions of a plurality of nucleic acids which encode distinct polypeptides are fused together to create chimeric nucleic acid sequences which encode chimeric polypeptides as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 965 408 filed Jul. 9 1996 entitled Method of DNA Reassembly by Interrupting Synthesis and U.S. Pat. No. 5 939 250 filed May 22 1996 entitled Production of Enzymes Having Desired Activities by Mutagenesis.

The variants of the polypeptides of the invention may be variants in which one or more of the amino acid residues of the polypeptides of the sequences of the invention are substituted with a conserved or non conserved amino acid residue in one aspect a conserved amino acid residue and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code.

Conservative substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the following replacements replacements of an aliphatic amino acid such as Alanine Valine Leucine and Isoleucine with another aliphatic amino acid replacement of a Serine with a Threonine or vice versa replacement of an acidic residue such as Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid with another acidic residue replacement of a residue bearing an amide group such as Asparagine and Glutamine with another residue bearing an amide group exchange of a basic residue such as Lysine and Arginine with another basic residue and replacement of an aromatic residue such as Phenylalanine Tyrosine with another aromatic residue.

Other variants are those in which one or more of the amino acid residues of a polypeptide of the invention includes a substituent group.

Still other variants are those in which the polypeptide is associated with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol .

Additional variants are those in which additional amino acids are fused to the polypeptide such as a leader sequence a secretory sequence a proprotein sequence or a sequence which facilitates purification enrichment or stabilization of the polypeptide.

In some aspects the fragments derivatives and analogs retain the same biological function or activity as the polypeptides of the invention. In other aspects the fragment derivative or analog includes a proprotein such that the fragment derivative or analog can be activated by cleavage of the proprotein portion to produce an active polypeptide.

The invention provides methods for modifying polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein encoding nucleic acids to modify codon usage. In one aspect the invention provides methods for modifying codons in a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein to increase or decrease its expression in a host cell. The invention also provides nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein modified to increase its expression in a host cell a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein so modified and methods of making the modified a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. The method comprises identifying a non preferred or a less preferred codon in a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein encoding nucleic acid and replacing one or more of these non preferred or less preferred codons with a preferred codon encoding the same amino acid as the replaced codon and at least one non preferred or less preferred codon in the nucleic acid has been replaced by a preferred codon encoding the same amino acid. A preferred codon is a codon over represented in coding sequences in genes in the host cell and a non preferred or less preferred codon is a codon under represented in coding sequences in genes in the host cell.

Host cells for expressing the nucleic acids expression cassettes and vectors of the invention include bacteria yeast fungi plant cells insect cells and mammalian cells. Thus the invention provides methods for optimizing codon usage in all of these cells codon altered nucleic acids and polypeptides made by the codon altered nucleic acids. Exemplary host cells include gram negative bacteria such as gram positive bacteria such as sp. . Exemplary host cells also include eukaryotic organisms e.g. various yeast such as sp. including and and mammalian cells and cell lines and insect cells and cell lines. Thus the invention also includes nucleic acids and polypeptides optimized for expression in these organisms and species.

For example the codons of a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein isolated from a bacterial cell are modified such that the nucleic acid is optimally expressed in a bacterial cell different from the bacteria from which the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein was derived a yeast a fungi a plant cell an insect cell or a mammalian cell. Methods for optimizing codons are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 795 737 Baca 2000 Int. J. Parasitol. 30 113 118 Hale 1998 Protein Expr. Purif. 12 185 188 Narum 2001 Infect.

The invention provides transgenic non human animals comprising a nucleic acid a polypeptide e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein an expression cassette or vector or a transfected or transformed cell of the invention. The invention also provides methods of making and using these transgenic non human animals.

The transgenic non human animals can be e.g. goats rabbits sheep pigs including all swine hogs and related animals cows rats and mice comprising the nucleic acids of the invention. These animals can be used e.g. as in vivo models to study a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity or as models to screen for agents that change the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity in vivo. The coding sequences for the polypeptides to be expressed in the transgenic non human animals can be designed to be constitutive or under the control of tissue specific developmental specific or inducible transcriptional regulatory factors. Transgenic non human animals can be designed and generated using any method known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 211 428 6 187 992 6 156 952 6 118 044 6 111 166 6 107 541 5 959 171 5 922 854 5 892 070 5 880 327 5 891 698 5 639 940 5 573 933 5 387 742 5 087 571 describing making and using transformed cells and eggs and transgenic mice rats rabbits sheep pigs and cows. See also e.g. Pollock 1999 J. Immunol. Methods 231 147 157 describing the production of recombinant proteins in the milk of transgenic dairy animals Baguisi 1999 Nat. Biotechnol. 17 456 461 demonstrating the production of transgenic goats. U.S. Pat. No. 6 211 428 describes making and using transgenic non human mammals which express in their brains a nucleic acid construct comprising a DNA sequence. U.S. Pat. No. 5 387 742 describes injecting cloned recombinant or synthetic DNA sequences into fertilized mouse eggs implanting the injected eggs in pseudo pregnant females and growing to term transgenic mice. U.S. Pat. No. 6 187 992 describes making and using a transgenic mouse.

 Knockout animals can also be used to practice the methods of the invention. For example in one aspect the transgenic or modified animals of the invention comprise a knockout animal e.g. a knockout mouse engineered not to express an endogenous gene which is replaced with a gene expressing a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention or a fusion protein comprising a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention.

The invention provides transgenic plants and seeds comprising a nucleic acid a polypeptide e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein an expression cassette or vector or a transfected or transformed cell of the invention. The invention also provides plant products e.g. oils seeds leaves extracts and the like comprising a nucleic acid and or a polypeptide e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention. The transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous a dicot or monocotyledonous a monocot . The invention also provides methods of making and using these transgenic plants and seeds. The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing a polypeptide of the present invention may be constructed in accordance with any method known in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 309 872.

Nucleic acids and expression constructs of the invention can be introduced into a plant cell by any means. For example nucleic acids or expression constructs can be introduced into the genome of a desired plant host or the nucleic acids or expression constructs can be episomes. Introduction into the genome of a desired plant can be such that the host s a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein production is regulated by endogenous transcriptional or translational control elements. The invention also provides knockout plants where insertion of gene sequence by e.g. homologous recombination has disrupted the expression of the endogenous gene. Means to generate knockout plants are well known in the art see e.g. Strepp 1998 Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 4368 4373 Miao 1995 Plant J 7 359 365. See discussion on transgenic plants below.

The nucleic acids of the invention can be used to confer desired traits on essentially any plant e.g. on starch producing plants such as potato wheat rice barley and the like. Nucleic acids of the invention can be used to manipulate metabolic pathways of a plant in order to optimize or alter host s expression of polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. The can change a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity in a plant. Alternatively a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention can be used in production of a transgenic plant to produce a compound not naturally produced by that plant. This can lower production costs or create a novel product.

In one aspect the first step in production of a transgenic plant involves making an expression construct for expression in a plant cell. These techniques are well known in the art. They can include selecting and cloning a promoter a coding sequence for facilitating efficient binding of ribosomes to mRNA and selecting the appropriate gene terminator sequences. One exemplary constitutive promoter is CaMV35S from the cauliflower mosaic virus which generally results in a high degree of expression in plants. Other promoters are more specific and respond to cues in the plant s internal or external environment. An exemplary light inducible promoter is the promoter from the cab gene encoding the major chlorophyll a b binding protein.

In one aspect the nucleic acid is modified to achieve greater expression in a plant cell. For example a sequence of the invention is likely to have a higher percentage of A T nucleotide pairs compared to that seen in a plant some of which prefer G C nucleotide pairs. Therefore A T nucleotides in the coding sequence can be substituted with G C nucleotides without significantly changing the amino acid sequence to enhance production of the gene product in plant cells.

Selectable marker gene can be added to the gene construct in order to identify plant cells or tissues that have successfully integrated the transgene. This may be necessary because achieving incorporation and expression of genes in plant cells is a rare event occurring in just a few percent of the targeted tissues or cells. Selectable marker genes encode proteins that provide resistance to agents that are normally toxic to plants such as antibiotics or herbicides. Only plant cells that have integrated the selectable marker gene will survive when grown on a medium containing the appropriate antibiotic or herbicide. As for other inserted genes marker genes also require promoter and termination sequences for proper function.

In one aspect making transgenic plants or seeds comprises incorporating sequences of the invention and optionally marker genes into a target expression construct e.g. a plasmid along with positioning of the promoter and the terminator sequences. This can involve transferring the modified gene into the plant through a suitable method. For example a construct may be introduced directly into the genomic DNA of the plant cell using techniques such as electroporation and microinjection of plant cell protoplasts or the constructs can be introduced directly to plant tissue using ballistic methods such as DNA particle bombardment. For example see e.g. Christou 1997 Plant Mol. Biol. 35 197 203 Pawlowski 1996 Mol. Biotechnol. 6 17 30 Klein 1987 Nature 327 70 73 Takumi 1997 Genes Genet. Syst. 72 63 69 discussing use of particle bombardment to introduce transgenes into wheat and Adam 1997 supra for use of particle bombardment to introduce YACs into plant cells. For example Rinehart 1997 supra used particle bombardment to generate transgenic cotton plants. Apparatus for accelerating particles is described U.S. Pat. No. 5 015 580 and the commercially available BioRad Biolistics PDS 2000 particle acceleration instrument see also John U.S. Pat. No. 5 608 148 and Ellis U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 730 describing particle mediated transformation of gymnosperms.

In one aspect protoplasts can be immobilized and injected with a nucleic acids e.g. an expression construct. Although plant regeneration from protoplasts is not easy with cereals plant regeneration is possible in legumes using somatic embryogenesis from protoplast derived callus. Organized tissues can be transformed with naked DNA using gene gun technique where DNA is coated on tungsten microprojectiles shot 1 100th the size of cells which carry the DNA deep into cells and organelles. Transformed tissue is then induced to regenerate usually by somatic embryogenesis. This technique has been successful in several cereal species including maize and rice.

Nucleic acids e.g. expression constructs can also be introduced in to plant cells using recombinant viruses. Plant cells can be transformed using viral vectors such as e.g. tobacco mosaic virus derived vectors Rouwendal 1997 Plant Mol. Biol. 33 989 999 see Porta 1996 Use of viral replicons for the expression of genes in plants Mol. Biotechnol. 5 209 221.

Alternatively nucleic acids e.g. an expression construct can be combined with suitable T DNA flanking regions and introduced into a conventional host vector. The virulence functions of the host will direct the insertion of the construct and adjacent marker into the plant cell DNA when the cell is infected by the bacteria. mediated transformation techniques including disarming and use of binary vectors are well described in the scientific literature. See e.g. Horsch 1984 233 496 498 Fraley 1983 80 4803 1983 Potrykus ed. Springer Verlag Berlin 1995 . The DNA in an cell is contained in the bacterial chromosome as well as in another structure known as a Ti tumor inducing plasmid. The Ti plasmid contains a stretch of DNA termed T DNA 20 kb long that is transferred to the plant cell in the infection process and a series of vir virulence genes that direct the infection process. can only infect a plant through wounds when a plant root or stem is wounded it gives off certain chemical signals in response to which the vir genes of become activated and direct a series of events necessary for the transfer of the T DNA from the Ti plasmid to the plant s chromosome. The T DNA enters the plant cell through the wound. One speculation is that the T DNA waits until the plant DNA is being replicated or transcribed then inserts itself into the exposed plant DNA. In order to use as a transgene vector the tumor inducing section of T DNA have to be removed while retaining the T DNA border regions and the vir genes. The transgene is then inserted between the T DNA border regions where it is transferred to the plant cell and becomes integrated into the plant s chromosomes.

The invention provides for the transformation of monocotyledonous plants using the nucleic acids of the invention including important cereals see Hiei 1997 Plant Mol. Biol. 35 205 218. See also e.g. Horsch Science 1984 233 496 Fraley 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 80 4803 Thykjaer 1997 supra Park 1996 Plant Mol. Biol. 32 1135 1148 discussing T DNA integration into genomic DNA. See also D Halluin U.S. Pat. No. 5 712 135 describing a process for the stable integration of a DNA comprising a gene that is functional in a cell of a cereal or other monocotyledonous plant.

In one aspect the third step can involve selection and regeneration of whole plants capable of transmitting the incorporated target gene to the next generation. Such regeneration techniques rely on manipulation of certain phytohormones in a tissue culture growth medium typically relying on a biocide and or herbicide marker that has been introduced together with the desired nucleotide sequences. Plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts is described in Evans et al. pp. 124 176 MacMillilan Publishing Company New York 1983 and Binding pp. 21 73 CRC Press Boca Raton 1985. Regeneration can also be obtained from plant callus explants organs or parts thereof. Such regeneration techniques are described generally in Klee 1987 Ann. Rev. of Plant Phys. 38 467 486. To obtain whole plants from transgenic tissues such as immature embryos they can be grown under controlled environmental conditions in a series of media containing nutrients and hormones a process known as tissue culture. Once whole plants are generated and produce seed evaluation of the progeny begins.

After the expression cassette is stably incorporated in transgenic plants it can be introduced into other plants by sexual crossing. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used depending upon the species to be crossed. Since transgenic expression of the nucleic acids of the invention leads to phenotypic changes plants comprising the recombinant nucleic acids of the invention can be sexually crossed with a second plant to obtain a final product. Thus the seed of the invention can be derived from a cross between two transgenic plants of the invention or a cross between a plant of the invention and another plant. The desired effects e.g. expression of the polypeptides of the invention to produce a plant in which flowering behavior is altered can be enhanced when both parental plants express the polypeptides e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention. The desired effects can be passed to future plant generations by standard propagation means.

The nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention are expressed in or inserted in any plant or seed. Transgenic plants of the invention can be dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous. Examples of monocot transgenic plants of the invention are grasses such as meadow grass blue grass forage grass such as temperate grass such as and cereals e.g. wheat oats rye barley rice sorghum and maize corn . Examples of dicot transgenic plants of the invention are tobacco legumes such as lupins potato sugar beet pea bean and soybean and cruciferous plants family Brassicaceae such as cauliflower rape seed and the closely related model organism . Thus the transgenic plants and seeds of the invention include a broad range of plants including but not limited to species from the genera and

In alternative embodiments the nucleic acids of the invention are expressed in plants which contain fiber cells including e.g. cotton silk cotton tree Kapok Ceiba pentandra desert willow creosote bush winterfat balsa ramie kenaf hemp roselle jute sisal abaca and flax. In alternative embodiments the transgenic plants of the invention can be members of the genus including members of any species such as and

The invention also provides for transgenic plants to be used for producing large amounts of the polypeptides e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or antibody of the invention. For example see Palmgren 1997 Trends Genet. 13 348 Chong 1997 Transgenic Res. 6 289 296 producing human milk protein beta casein in transgenic potato plants using an auxin inducible bidirectional mannopine synthase mas1 2 promoter with mediated leaf disc transformation methods .

Using known procedures one of skill can screen for plants of the invention by detecting the increase or decrease of transgene mRNA or protein in transgenic plants. Means for detecting and quantitation of mRNAs or proteins are well known in the art.

In one aspect the invention provides isolated or recombinant polypeptides having a sequence identity e.g. at least about 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or more or complete 100 sequence identity or homology to an exemplary sequence of the invention e.g. proteins having a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4 SEQ ID NO 6 SEQ ID NO 8 SEQ ID NO 10 etc. and all polypeptides disclosed in the SEQ ID listing which include all even numbered SEQ ID NO s from SEQ ID NO 2 through SEQ ID NO 26 898 . The percent sequence identity can be over the full length of the polypeptide or the identity can be over a region of at least about 50 60 70 80 90 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 or more residues.

 Amino acid or amino acid sequence as used herein refer to an oligopeptide peptide polypeptide or protein sequence or to a fragment portion or subunit of any of these and to naturally occurring or synthetic molecules. Amino acid or amino acid sequence include an oligopeptide peptide polypeptide or protein sequence or to a fragment portion or subunit of any of these and to naturally occurring or synthetic molecules. The term polypeptide as used herein refers to amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds i.e. peptide isosteres and may contain modified amino acids other than the 20 gene encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes such as post translational processing or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Modifications can occur anywhere in the polypeptide including the peptide backbone the amino acid side chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also a given polypeptide may have many types of modifications. Modifications include acetylation acylation ADP ribosylation amidation covalent attachment of flavin covalent attachment of a heme moiety covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative covalent attachment of a phosphatidylinositol cross linking cyclization disulfide bond formation demethylation formation of covalent cross links formation of cysteine formation of pyroglutamate formylation gamma carboxylation glycosylation GPI anchor formation hydroxylation iodination methylation myristolyation oxidation pegylation glucan hydrolase processing phosphorylation prenylation racemization selenoylation sulfation and transfer RNA mediated addition of amino acids to protein such as arginylation. See Creighton T. E. Proteins Structure and Molecular Properties 2nd Ed. W.H. Freeman and Company New York 1993 B. C. Johnson Ed. Academic Press New York pp. 1 12 1983 . The peptides and polypeptides of the invention also include all mimetic and peptidomimetic forms as described in further detail below.

As used herein the term isolated means that the material is removed from its original environment e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring . For example a naturally occurring polynucleotide or polypeptide present in a living animal is not isolated but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system is isolated. Such polynucleotides could be part of a vector and or such polynucleotides or polypeptides could be part of a composition and still be isolated in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. As used herein the term purified does not require absolute purity rather it is intended as a relative definition. Individual nucleic acids obtained from a library have been conventionally purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The sequences obtained from these clones could not be obtained directly either from the library or from total human DNA. The purified nucleic acids of the invention have been purified from the remainder of the genomic DNA in the organism by at least 10 10fold. However the term purified also includes nucleic acids which have been purified from the remainder of the genomic DNA or from other sequences in a library or other environment by at least one order of magnitude typically two or three orders and more typically four or five orders of magnitude.

 Recombinant polypeptides or proteins refer to polypeptides or proteins produced by recombinant DNA techniques i.e. produced from cells transformed by an exogenous DNA construct encoding the desired polypeptide or protein. Synthetic polypeptides or protein are those prepared by chemical synthesis. Solid phase chemical peptide synthesis methods can also be used to synthesize the polypeptide or fragments of the invention. Such method have been known in the art since the early 1960 s Merrifield R. B. 85 2149 2154 1963 See also Stewart J. M. and Young J. D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 2nd Ed. Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. pp. 11 12 and have recently been employed in commercially available laboratory peptide design and synthesis kits Cambridge Research Biochemicals . Such commercially available laboratory kits have generally utilized the teachings of H. M. Geysen et al 81 3998 1984 and provide for synthesizing peptides upon the tips of a multitude of rods or pins all of which are connected to a single plate.

Polypeptides of the invention can also be shorter than the full length of exemplary polypeptides. In alternative aspects the invention provides polypeptides peptides fragments ranging in size between about 5 and the full length of a polypeptide e.g. an enzyme such as a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein exemplary sizes being of about 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 100 125 150 175 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 or more residues e.g. contiguous residues of an exemplary a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention. Peptides of the invention e.g. a subsequence of an exemplary polypeptide of the invention can be useful as e.g. labeling probes antigens toleragens motifs a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein active sites e.g. catalytic domains signal sequences and or prepro domains.

In alternative aspects polypeptides of the invention having enzyme structural or binding activity are members of a genus of polypeptides sharing specific structural elements e.g. amino acid residues that correlate with enzyme structural or binding activity. These shared structural elements can be used for the routine generation of polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein variants. These shared structural elements of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention can be used as guidance for the routine generation of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein variants within the scope of the genus of polypeptides of the invention.

Polypeptides and peptides of the invention can be isolated from natural sources be synthetic or be recombinantly generated polypeptides. Peptides and proteins can be recombinantly expressed in vitro or in vivo. The peptides and polypeptides of the invention can be made and isolated using any method known in the art. Polypeptide and peptides of the invention can also be synthesized whole or in part using chemical methods well known in the art. See e.g. Caruthers 1980 Nucleic Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 215 223 Horn 1980 Nucleic Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 225 232 Banga A. K. Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins Formulation Processing and Delivery Systems 1995 Technomic Publishing Co. Lancaster Pa. For example peptide synthesis can be performed using various solid phase techniques see e.g. Roberge 1995 Science 269 202 Merrifield 1997 Methods Enzymol. 289 3 13 and automated synthesis may be achieved e.g. using the ABI 431A Peptide Synthesizer Perkin Elmer in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

The peptides and polypeptides of the invention can also be glycosylated. The glycosylation can be added post translationally either chemically or by cellular biosynthetic mechanisms wherein the later incorporates the use of known glycosylation motifs which can be native to the sequence or can be added as a peptide or added in the nucleic acid coding sequence. The glycosylation can be O linked or N linked.

The peptides and polypeptides of the invention as defined above include all mimetic and peptidomimetic forms. The terms mimetic and peptidomimetic refer to a synthetic chemical compound which has substantially the same structural and or functional characteristics of the polypeptides of the invention. The mimetic can be either entirely composed of synthetic non natural analogues of amino acids or is a chimeric molecule of partly natural peptide amino acids and partly non natural analogs of amino acids. The mimetic can also incorporate any amount of natural amino acid conservative substitutions as long as such substitutions also do not substantially alter the mimetic s structure and or activity. As with polypeptides of the invention which are conservative variants or members of a genus of polypeptides of the invention e.g. having about 50 or more sequence identity to an exemplary sequence of the invention routine experimentation will determine whether a mimetic is within the scope of the invention i.e. that its structure and or function is not substantially altered. Thus in one aspect a mimetic composition is within the scope of the invention if it has a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein s activity.

Polypeptide mimetic compositions of the invention can contain any combination of non natural structural components. In alternative aspect mimetic compositions of the invention include one or all of the following three structural groups a residue linkage groups other than the natural amide bond peptide bond linkages b non natural residues in place of naturally occurring amino acid residues or c residues which induce secondary structural mimicry i.e. to induce or stabilize a secondary structure e.g. a beta turn gamma turn beta sheet alpha helix conformation and the like. For example a polypeptide of the invention can be characterized as a mimetic when all or some of its residues are joined by chemical means other than natural peptide bonds. Individual peptidomimetic residues can be joined by peptide bonds other chemical bonds or coupling means such as e.g. glutaraldehyde N hydroxysuccinimide esters bifunctional maleimides N N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC or N N diisopropylcarbodiimide DIC . Linking groups that can be an alternative to the traditional amide bond peptide bond linkages include e.g. ketomethylene e.g. C O CH for C O NH aminomethylene CH NH ethylene olefin CH CH ether CH 0 thioether CH S tetrazole CN thiazole retroamide thioamide or ester see e.g. Spatola 1983 in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids Peptides and Proteins Vol. 7 pp 267 357 Peptide Backbone Modifications Marcell Dekker NY .

A polypeptide of the invention can also be characterized as a mimetic by containing all or some non natural residues in place of naturally occurring amino acid residues. Non natural residues are well described in the scientific and patent literature a few exemplary non natural compositions useful as mimetics of natural amino acid residues and guidelines are described below. Mimetics of aromatic amino acids can be generated by replacing by e.g. D or L naphylalanine D or L phenylglycine D or L 2 thieneylalanine D or L 1 2 3 or 4 pyreneylalanine D or L 3 thieneylalanine D or L 2 pyridinyl alanine D or L 3 pyridinyl alanine D or L 2 pyrazinyl alanine D or L 4 isopropyl phenylglycine D trifluoromethyl phenylglycine D trifluoromethyl phenylalanine D p fluoro phenylalanine D or L p biphenylphenylalanine D or L p methoxy biphenylphenylalanine D or L 2 indole alkyl alanines and D or L alkylainines where alkyl can be substituted or unsubstituted methyl ethyl propyl hexyl butyl pentyl isopropyl iso butyl sec isotyl iso pentyl or a non acidic amino acids. Aromatic rings of a non natural amino acid include e.g. thiazolyl thiophenyl pyrazolyl benzimidazolyl naphthyl furanyl pyrrolyl and pyridyl aromatic rings.

Mimetics of acidic amino acids can be generated by substitution by e.g. non carboxylate amino acids while maintaining a negative charge phosphono alanine sulfated threonine. Carboxyl side groups e.g. aspartyl or glutamyl can also be selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides R N C N R such as e.g. 1 cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinyl 4 ethyl carbodiimide or 1 ethyl 3 4 azonia 4 4 dimetholpentyl carbodiimide. Aspartyl or glutamyl can also be converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions. Mimetics of basic amino acids can be generated by substitution with e.g. in addition to lysine and arginine the amino acids ornithine citrulline or guanidino acetic acid or guanidino alkyl acetic acid where alkyl is defined above. Nitrile derivative e.g. containing the CN moiety in place of COOH can be substituted for asparagine or glutamine. Asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues can be deaminated to the corresponding aspartyl or glutamyl residues. Arginine residue mimetics can be generated by reacting arginyl with e.g. one or more conventional reagents including e.g. phenylglyoxal 2 3 butanedione 1 2 cyclo hexanedione or ninhydrin in one aspect under alkaline conditions. Tyrosine residue mimetics can be generated by reacting tyrosyl with e.g. aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. N acetylimidizol and tetranitromethane can be used to form O acetyl tyrosyl species and 3 nitro derivatives respectively. Cysteine residue mimetics can be generated by reacting cysteinyl residues with e.g. alpha haloacetates such as 2 chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide and corresponding amines to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteine residue mimetics can also be generated by reacting cysteinyl residues with e.g. bromo trifluoroacetone alpha bromo beta 5 imidozoyl propionic acid chloroacetyl phosphate N alkylmaleimides 3 nitro 2 pyridyl disulfide methyl 2 pyridyl disulfide p chloromercuribenzoate 2 chloromercuri 4 nitrophenol or chloro 7 nitrobenzo oxa 1 3 diazole. Lysine mimetics can be generated and amino terminal residues can be altered by reacting lysinyl with e.g. succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Lysine and other alpha amino containing residue mimetics can also be generated by reaction with imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate pyridoxal phosphate pyridoxal chloroborohydride trinitro benzenesulfonic acid O methylisourea 2 4 pentanedione and transamidase catalyzed reactions with glyoxylate. Mimetics of methionine can be generated by reaction with e.g. methionine sulfoxide. Mimetics of proline include e.g. pipecolic acid thiazolidine carboxylic acid 3 or 4 hydroxy proline dehydroproline 3 or 4 methylproline or 3 3 dimethylproline. Histidine residue mimetics can be generated by reacting histidyl with e.g. diethylprocarbonate or para bromophenacyl bromide. Other mimetics include e.g. those generated by hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the alpha amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine acetylation of the N terminal amine methylation of main chain amide residues or substitution with N methyl amino acids or amidation of C terminal carboxyl groups.

A residue e.g. an amino acid of a polypeptide of the invention can also be replaced by an amino acid or peptidomimetic residue of the opposite chirality. Thus any amino acid naturally occurring in the L configuration which can also be referred to as the R or S depending upon the structure of the chemical entity can be replaced with the amino acid of the same chemical structural type or a peptidomimetic but of the opposite chirality referred to as the D amino acid but also can be referred to as the R or S form.

The invention also provides methods for modifying the polypeptides of the invention by either natural processes such as post translational processing e.g. phosphorylation acylation etc or by chemical modification techniques and the resulting modified polypeptides. Modifications can occur anywhere in the polypeptide including the peptide backbone the amino acid side chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also a given polypeptide may have many types of modifications. Modifications include acetylation acylation ADP ribosylation amidation covalent attachment of flavin covalent attachment of a heme moiety covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative covalent attachment of a phosphatidylinositol cross linking cyclization disulfide bond formation demethylation formation of covalent cross links formation of cysteine formation of pyroglutamate formylation gamma carboxylation glycosylation GPI anchor formation hydroxylation iodination methylation myristolyation oxidation pegylation proteolytic processing phosphorylation prenylation racemization selenoylation sulfation and transfer RNA mediated addition of amino acids to protein such as arginylation.

Solid phase chemical peptide synthesis methods can also be used to synthesize the polypeptide or fragments of the invention. Such method have been known in the art since the early 1960 s Merrifield R. B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85 2149 2154 1963 See also Stewart J. M. and Young J. D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 2nd Ed. Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. pp. 11 12 and have recently been employed in commercially available laboratory peptide design and synthesis kits Cambridge Research Biochemicals . Such commercially available laboratory kits have generally utilized the teachings of H. M. Geysen et al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 3998 1984 and provide for synthesizing peptides upon the tips of a multitude of rods or pins all of which are connected to a single plate. When such a system is utilized a plate of rods or pins is inverted and inserted into a second plate of corresponding wells or reservoirs which contain solutions for attaching or anchoring an appropriate amino acid to the pin s or rod s tips. By repeating such a process step i.e. inverting and inserting the rod s and pin s tips into appropriate solutions amino acids are built into desired peptides. In addition a number of available FMOC peptide synthesis systems are available. For example assembly of a polypeptide or fragment can be carried out on a solid support using an Applied Biosystems Inc. Model 431A automated peptide synthesizer. Such equipment provides ready access to the peptides of the invention either by direct synthesis or by synthesis of a series of fragments that can be coupled using other known techniques.

The polypeptides of the invention include a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein in an active or inactive form. For example the polypeptides of the invention include proproteins before maturation or processing of prepro sequences e.g. by a proprotein processing enzyme such as a proprotein convertase to generate an active mature protein. The polypeptides of the invention include a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein inactive for other reasons e.g. before activation by a post translational processing event e.g. an endo or exo peptidase or proteinase action a phosphorylation event an amidation a glycosylation or a sulfation a dimerization event and the like. The polypeptides of the invention include all active forms including active subsequences e.g. catalytic domains or active sites of the enzyme.

The invention includes immobilized polypeptides enzymes proteins e.g. structural or binding proteins anti polypeptides anti enzymes anti proteins e.g. anti structural or anti binding proteins antibodies and fragments thereof. The invention provides methods for inhibiting a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity e.g. using dominant negative mutants or anti polypeptide anti enzyme anti protein e.g. anti structural or anti binding protein antibodies of the invention. The invention includes heterocomplexes e.g. fusion proteins heterodimers etc. comprising the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins of the invention.

Polypeptides of the invention can have an enzyme structural or binding activity under various conditions e.g. extremes in pH and or temperature oxidizing agents and the like. The invention provides methods leading to alternative a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein preparations with different catalytic efficiencies and stabilities e.g. towards temperature oxidizing agents and changing wash conditions. In one aspect a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein variants can be produced using techniques of site directed mutagenesis and or random mutagenesis. In one aspect directed evolution can be used to produce a great variety of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein variants with alternative specificities and stability.

The proteins of the invention are also useful as research reagents to identify a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein modulators e.g. activators or inhibitors of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity. Briefly test samples compounds broths extracts and the like are added to a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein assays to determine their ability to inhibit substrate cleavage. Inhibitors identified in this way can be used in industry and research to reduce or prevent undesired proteolysis. As with a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein inhibitors can be combined to increase the spectrum of activity.

The enzymes of the invention are also useful as research reagents to digest proteins or in protein sequencing. For example the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins may be used to break polypeptides into smaller fragments for sequencing using e.g. an automated sequencer.

The invention also provides methods of discovering new a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein using the nucleic acids polypeptides and antibodies of the invention. In one aspect phagemid libraries are screened for expression based discovery of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. In another aspect lambda phage libraries are screened for expression based discovery of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. Screening of the phage or phagemid libraries can allow the detection of toxic clones improved access to substrate reduced need for engineering a host by passing the potential for any bias resulting from mass excision of the library and faster growth at low clone densities. Screening of phage or phagemid libraries can be in liquid phase or in solid phase. In one aspect the invention provides screening in liquid phase. This gives a greater flexibility in assay conditions additional substrate flexibility higher sensitivity for weak clones and ease of automation over solid phase screening.

The invention provides screening methods using the proteins and nucleic acids of the invention and robotic automation to enable the execution of many thousands of biocatalytic reactions and screening assays in a short period of time e.g. per day as well as ensuring a high level of accuracy and reproducibility see discussion of arrays below . As a result a library of derivative compounds can be produced in a matter of weeks. For further teachings on modification of molecules including small molecules see PCT US94 09174.

In one aspect polypeptides or fragments of the invention may be obtained through biochemical enrichment or purification procedures. The sequence of potentially homologous polypeptides or fragments may be determined by a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein assays gel electrophoresis and or microsequencing. The sequence of the prospective polypeptide or fragment of the invention can be compared to an exemplary polypeptide of the invention or a fragment e.g. comprising at least about 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 or more consecutive amino acids thereof using any of the programs described above.

Another aspect of the invention is an assay for identifying fragments or variants of the invention which retain the enzymatic function of the polypeptides of the invention. For example the fragments or variants of said polypeptides may be used to catalyze biochemical reactions e.g. production of a nootkatone from a valencene which indicate that the fragment or variant retains the enzymatic activity of a polypeptide of the invention.

An exemplary assay for determining if fragments of variants retain the enzymatic activity of the polypeptides of the invention includes the steps of contacting the polypeptide fragment or variant with a substrate molecule under conditions which allow the polypeptide fragment or variant to function and detecting either a decrease in the level of substrate or an increase in the level of the specific reaction product of the reaction between the polypeptide and substrate.

The present invention exploits the unique catalytic properties of enzymes. Whereas the use of biocatalysts i.e. purified or crude enzymes non living or living cells in chemical transformations normally requires the identification of a particular biocatalyst that reacts with a specific starting compound the present invention uses selected biocatalysts and reaction conditions that are specific for functional groups that are present in many starting compounds such as small molecules. Each biocatalyst is specific for one functional group or several related functional groups and can react with many starting compounds containing this functional group.

The biocatalytic reactions produce a population of derivatives from a single starting compound. These derivatives can be subjected to another round of biocatalytic reactions to produce a second population of derivative compounds. Thousands of variations of the original small molecule or compound can be produced with each iteration of biocatalytic derivatization.

Enzymes react at specific sites of a starting compound without affecting the rest of the molecule a process which is very difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods. This high degree of biocatalytic specificity provides the means to identify a single active compound within the library. The library is characterized by the series of biocatalytic reactions used to produce it a so called biosynthetic history . Screening the library for biological activities and tracing the biosynthetic history identifies the specific reaction sequence producing the active compound. The reaction sequence is repeated and the structure of the synthesized compound determined. This mode of identification unlike other synthesis and screening approaches does not require immobilization technologies and compounds can be synthesized and tested free in solution using virtually any type of screening assay. It is important to note that the high degree of specificity of enzyme reactions on functional groups allows for the tracking of specific enzymatic reactions that make up the biocatalytically produced library.

Many of the procedural steps are performed using robotic automation enabling the execution of many thousands of biocatalytic reactions and screening assays per day as well as ensuring a high level of accuracy and reproducibility. As a result a library of derivative compounds can be produced in a matter of weeks which would take years to produce using current chemical methods.

In a particular aspect the invention provides a method for modifying small molecules comprising contacting a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide described herein or enzymatically active fragments thereof with a small molecule to produce a modified small molecule. A library of modified small molecules is tested to determine if a modified small molecule is present within the library which exhibits a desired activity. A specific biocatalytic reaction which produces the modified small molecule of desired activity is identified by systematically eliminating each of the biocatalytic reactions used to produce a portion of the library and then testing the small molecules produced in the portion of the library for the presence or absence of the modified small molecule with the desired activity. The specific biocatalytic reactions which produce the modified small molecule of desired activity is optionally repeated. The biocatalytic reactions are conducted with a group of biocatalysts that react with distinct structural moieties found within the structure of a small molecule each biocatalyst is specific for one structural moiety or a group of related structural moieties and each biocatalyst reacts with many different small molecules which contain the distinct structural moiety.

The invention provides a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein signal sequences e.g. signal peptides SPs prepro domains and catalytic domains CDs . The SPs prepro domains and or CDs of the invention can be isolated or recombinant peptides or can be part of a fusion protein e.g. as a heterologous domain in a chimeric protein. The invention provides nucleic acids encoding these catalytic domains CDs prepro domains and signal sequences SPs e.g. a peptide having a sequence comprising consisting of amino terminal residues of a polypeptide of the invention .

The invention provides isolated or recombinant signal sequences e.g. signal peptides consisting of or comprising a sequence as set forth in residues 1 to 14 1 to 15 1 to 16 1 to 17 1 to 18 1 to 19 1 to 20 1 to 21 1 to 22 1 to 23 1 to 24 1 to 25 1 to 26 1 to 27 1 to 28 1 to 28 1 to 30 1 to 31 1 to 32 1 to 33 1 to 34 1 to 35 1 to 36 1 to 37 1 to 38 1 to 40 1 to 41 1 to 42 1 to 43 1 to 44 1 to 45 1 to 46 or 1 to 47 or more of a polypeptide of the invention e.g. SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 5 SEQ ID NO 7 SEQ ID NO 9 SEQ ID NO 11 SEQ ID NO 13 SEQ ID NO 15 SEQ ID NO 17 SEQ ID NO 19 SEQ ID NO 21 SEQ ID NO 23 SEQ ID NO 25 SEQ ID NO 27 SEQ ID NO 29 SEQ ID NO 31 SEQ ID NO 33 SEQ ID NO 35 SEQ ID NO 37 SEQ ID NO 39 SEQ ID NO 41 SEQ ID NO 43 SEQ ID NO 45 SEQ ID NO 47 SEQ ID NO 49 SEQ ID NO 51 SEQ ID NO 53 SEQ ID NO 55 SEQ ID NO 57 SEQ ID NO 59 SEQ ID NO 61 SEQ ID NO 63 SEQ ID NO 65 SEQ ID NO 67 SEQ ID NO 69 SEQ ID NO 71 SEQ ID NO 73 SEQ ID NO 75 SEQ ID NO 77 SEQ ID NO 79 SEQ ID NO 81 SEQ ID NO 83 SEQ ID NO 85 SEQ ID NO 87 SEQ ID NO 89 SEQ ID NO 91 SEQ ID NO 93 SEQ ID NO 95 SEQ ID NO 97 SEQ ID NO 99 SEQ ID NO 101 SEQ ID NO 103 SEQ ID NO 105 and all polypeptides disclosed in the SEQ ID listing which include all odd numbered SEQ ID NO s from SEQ ID NO 3 through SEQ ID NO 26 898. In one aspect the invention provides signal sequences comprising the first 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 or more amino terminal residues of a polypeptide of the invention.

The invention also provides isolated or recombinant signal sequences comprising consisting of the signal sequences set forth in Table 4 and polypeptides comprising these signal sequences. The polypeptide can be enzyme or protein of the invention. For example reading Table 4 the invention provides an isolated or recombinant signal sequence as set forth by residues 1 to 16 of SEQ ID NO 10010. This can be determined by reading the second column for the first row Probability 0.992 AA1 16 AA2 17 wherein the cleavage of signal sequence takes place between amino acid 16 AA16 and amino acid 17 AA17 with a probability of 0.992 that this is the correct cleavage site. Therefore the signal sequence is predicted to be from the amino acid in position 1 of SEQ ID NO 10010 up to and including the amino acid in position 16 of SEQ ID NO 10010. This signal sequence in one aspect is encoded by a subsequence of SEQ ID NO 10009.

Methods for identifying prepro domain sequences and signal sequences are well known in the art see e.g. Van de Ven 1993 Crit. Rev. Oncog. 4 2 115 136. For example to identify a prepro sequence the protein is purified from the extracellular space and the N terminal protein sequence is determined and compared to the unprocessed form.

The invention includes polypeptides with or without a signal sequence and or a prepro sequence. The invention includes polypeptides with heterologous signal sequences and or prepro sequences. The prepro sequence including a sequence of the invention used as a heterologous prepro domain can be located on the amino terminal or the carboxy terminal end of the protein. The invention also includes isolated or recombinant signal sequences prepro sequences and catalytic domains e.g. active sites comprising sequences of the invention. The polypeptide comprising a signal sequence of the invention can be a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention or another polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or another enzyme or other polypeptide.

The polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein signal sequences SPs and or prepro sequences of the invention can be isolated peptides or sequences joined to another a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or a non polypeptide non enzyme non protein e.g. non structural or non binding protein e.g. as a fusion chimeric protein. In one aspect the invention provides polypeptides comprising a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein signal sequences of the invention. In one aspect polypeptides comprising polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein signal sequences SPs and or prepro of the invention comprise sequences heterologous to a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention e.g. a fusion protein comprising an SP and or prepro of the invention and sequences from another a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or a non polypeptide non enzyme non protein e.g. non structural or non binding protein . In one aspect the invention provides a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention with heterologous SPs and or prepro sequences e.g. sequences with a yeast signal sequence. A polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention can comprise a heterologous SP and or prepro in a vector e.g. a pPIC series vector Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. .

In one aspect SPs and or prepro sequences of the invention are identified following identification of novel a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. The pathways by which proteins are sorted and transported to their proper cellular location are often referred to as protein targeting pathways. One of the most important elements in all of these targeting systems is a short amino acid sequence at the amino terminus of a newly synthesized polypeptide called the signal sequence. This signal sequence directs a protein to its appropriate location in the cell and is removed during transport or when the protein reaches its final destination. Most lysosomal membrane or secreted proteins have an amino terminal signal sequence that marks them for translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The signal sequences can vary in length from about 10 to 65 or more amino acid residues. Various methods of recognition of signal sequences are known to those of skill in the art. For example in one aspect novel a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein signal peptides are identified by a method referred to as SignalP. SignalP uses a combined neural network which recognizes both signal peptides and their cleavage sites. Nielsen 1997 Identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal peptides and prediction of their cleavage sites. Protein Engineering 10 1 6.

It should be understood that in some aspects a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention may not have SPs and or prepro sequences or domains. In one aspect the invention provides the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins of the invention lacking all or part of an SP and or a prepro domain. In one aspect the invention provides a nucleic acid sequence encoding a signal sequence SP and or prepro from one a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence of a different a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or optionally a signal sequence SPs and or prepro domain from a non enzyme or non protein e.g. non structural or non binding protein may be desired.

The invention also provides isolated or recombinant polypeptides comprising signal sequences SPs prepro domain and or catalytic domains CDs of the invention and heterologous sequences. The heterologous sequences are sequences not naturally associated e.g. to a enzyme with an SP prepro domain and or CD. The sequence to which the SP prepro domain and or CD are not naturally associated can be on the SP s prepro domain and or CD s amino terminal end carboxy terminal end and or on both ends of the SP and or CD. In one aspect the invention provides an isolated or recombinant polypeptide comprising or consisting of a polypeptide comprising a signal sequence SP prepro domain and or catalytic domain CD of the invention with the proviso that it is not associated with any sequence to which it is naturally associated e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein sequence . Similarly in one aspect the invention provides isolated or recombinant nucleic acids encoding these polypeptides. Thus in one aspect the isolated or recombinant nucleic acid of the invention comprises coding sequence for a signal sequence SP prepro domain and or catalytic domain CD of the invention and a heterologous sequence i.e. a sequence not naturally associated with the a signal sequence SP prepro domain and or catalytic domain CD of the invention . The heterologous sequence can be on the 3 terminal end 5 terminal end and or on both ends of the SP prepro domain and or CD coding sequence.

Hybrid Chimeric a Polypeptide Enzyme Protein e.g. Structural or Binding Protein and Peptide Libraries

In one aspect the invention provides hybrid a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein and fusion proteins including peptide libraries comprising sequences of the invention. The peptide libraries of the invention can be used to isolate peptide modulators e.g. activators or inhibitors of targets such as a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein substrates receptors enzymes. The peptide libraries of the invention can be used to identify formal binding partners of targets such as ligands e.g. cytokines hormones and the like. In one aspect the invention provides chimeric proteins comprising a signal sequence SP prepro domain and or catalytic domain CD of the invention or a combination thereof and a heterologous sequence see above .

In one aspect the fusion proteins of the invention e.g. the peptide moiety are conformationally stabilized relative to linear peptides to allow a higher binding affinity for targets. The invention provides fusions of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention and other peptides including known and random peptides. They can be fused in such a manner that the structure of the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins is not significantly perturbed and the peptide is metabolically or structurally conformationally stabilized. This allows the creation of a peptide library that is easily monitored both for its presence within cells and its quantity.

Amino acid sequence variants of the invention can be characterized by a predetermined nature of the variation a feature that sets them apart from a naturally occurring form e.g. an allelic or interspecies variation of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein sequence. In one aspect the variants of the invention exhibit the same qualitative biological activity as the naturally occurring analogue. Alternatively the variants can be selected for having modified characteristics. In one aspect while the site or region for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example in order to optimize the performance of a mutation at a given site random mutagenesis may be conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein variants screened for the optimal combination of desired activity. Techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known as discussed herein for example M13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Screening of the mutants can be done using e.g. assays of glucan hydrolysis. In alternative aspects amino acid substitutions can be single residues insertions can be on the order of from about 1 to 20 amino acids although considerably larger insertions can be done. Deletions can range from about 1 to about 20 30 40 50 60 70 residues or more. To obtain a final derivative with the optimal properties substitutions deletions insertions or any combination thereof may be used. Generally these changes are done on a few amino acids to minimize the alteration of the molecule. However larger changes may be tolerated in certain circumstances.

The invention provides a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein where the structure of the polypeptide backbone the secondary or the tertiary structure e.g. an alpha helical or beta sheet structure has been modified. In one aspect the charge or hydrophobicity has been modified. In one aspect the bulk of a side chain has been modified. Substantial changes in function or immunological identity are made by selecting substitutions that are less conservative. For example substitutions can be made which more significantly affect the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the alteration for example a alpha helical or a beta sheet structure a charge or a hydrophobic site of the molecule which can be at an active site or a side chain. The invention provides substitutions in polypeptide of the invention where a a hydrophilic residues e.g. seryl or threonyl is substituted for or by a hydrophobic residue e.g. leucyl isoleucyl phenylalanyl valyl or alanyl b a cysteine or proline is substituted for or by any other residue c a residue having an electropositive side chain e.g. lysyl arginyl or histidyl is substituted for or by an electronegative residue e.g. glutamyl or aspartyl or d a residue having a bulky side chain e.g. phenylalanine is substituted for or by one not having a side chain e.g. glycine. The variants can exhibit the same qualitative biological activity i.e. an enzyme structural or binding activity although variants can be selected to modify the characteristics of the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins as needed.

In one aspect a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention comprise epitopes or purification tags signal sequences or other fusion sequences etc. In one aspect the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins of the invention can be fused to a random peptide to form a fusion polypeptide. By fused or operably linked herein is meant that the random peptide and the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein are linked together in such a manner as to minimize the disruption to the stability of the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein structure e.g. it retains a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity. The fusion polypeptide or fusion polynucleotide encoding the fusion polypeptide can comprise further components as well including multiple peptides at multiple loops.

In one aspect the peptides and nucleic acids encoding them are randomized either fully randomized or they are biased in their randomization e.g. in nucleotide residue frequency generally or per position. Randomized means that each nucleic acid and peptide consists of essentially random nucleotides and amino acids respectively. In one aspect the nucleic acids which give rise to the peptides can be chemically synthesized and thus may incorporate any nucleotide at any position. Thus when the nucleic acids are expressed to form peptides any amino acid residue may be incorporated at any position. The synthetic process can be designed to generate randomized nucleic acids to allow the formation of all or most of the possible combinations over the length of the nucleic acid thus forming a library of randomized nucleic acids. The library can provide a sufficiently structurally diverse population of randomized expression products to affect a probabilistically sufficient range of cellular responses to provide one or more cells exhibiting a desired response. Thus the invention provides an interaction library large enough so that at least one of its members will have a structure that gives it affinity for some molecule protein or other factor.

In one aspect a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention is a multidomain enzyme that comprises a signal peptide a carbohydrate binding module a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein catalytic domain a linker and or another catalytic domain.

The invention provides a means for generating chimeric polypeptides which may encode biologically active hybrid polypeptides e.g. hybrid a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein . In one aspect the original polynucleotides encode biologically active polypeptides. The method of the invention produces new hybrid polypeptides by utilizing cellular processes which integrate the sequence of the original polynucleotides such that the resulting hybrid polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide demonstrating activities derived from the original biologically active polypeptides. For example the original polynucleotides may encode a particular enzyme from different microorganisms. An enzyme encoded by a first polynucleotide from one organism or variant may for example function effectively under a particular environmental condition e.g. high salinity. An enzyme encoded by a second polynucleotide from a different organism or variant may function effectively under a different environmental condition such as extremely high temperatures. A hybrid polynucleotide containing sequences from the first and second original polynucleotides may encode an enzyme which exhibits characteristics of both enzymes encoded by the original polynucleotides. Thus the enzyme encoded by the hybrid polynucleotide may function effectively under environmental conditions shared by each of the enzymes encoded by the first and second polynucleotides e.g. high salinity and extreme temperatures.

A hybrid polypeptide resulting from the method of the invention may exhibit specialized enzyme activity not displayed in the original enzymes. For example following recombination and or reductive reassortment of polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein the resulting hybrid polypeptide encoded by a hybrid polynucleotide can be screened for specialized non enzyme non structural or non binding activities obtained from each of the original enzymes. Thus for example the hybrid polypeptide may be screened to ascertain those chemical functionalities which distinguish the hybrid polypeptide from the original parent polypeptides such as the temperature pH or salt concentration at which the hybrid polypeptide functions.

In one aspect the invention relates to a method for producing a biologically active hybrid polypeptide and screening such a polypeptide for enhanced activity by 

The invention provides methods for isolating and discovering a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein and the nucleic acids that encode them. Polynucleotides or enzymes may be isolated from individual organisms isolates collections of organisms that have been grown in defined media enrichment cultures or uncultivated organisms environmental samples . The organisms can be isolated by e.g. in vivo biopanning see discussion below . The use of a culture independent approach to derive polynucleotides encoding novel bioactivities from environmental samples is most preferable since it allows one to access untapped resources of biodiversity. Polynucleotides or enzymes also can be isolated from any one of numerous organisms e.g. bacteria. In addition to whole cells polynucleotides or enzymes also can be isolated from crude enzyme preparations derived from cultures of these organisms e.g. bacteria.

 Environmental libraries are generated from environmental samples and represent the collective genomes of naturally occurring organisms archived in cloning vectors that can be propagated in suitable prokaryotic hosts. Because the cloned DNA is initially extracted directly from environmental samples the libraries are not limited to the small fraction of prokaryotes that can be grown in pure culture. Additionally a normalization of the environmental DNA present in these samples could allow more equal representation of the DNA from all of the species present in the original sample. This can dramatically increase the efficiency of finding interesting genes from minor constituents of the sample which may be under represented by several orders of magnitude compared to the dominant species.

For example gene libraries generated from one or more uncultivated microorganisms are screened for an activity of interest. Potential pathways encoding bioactive molecules of interest are first captured in prokaryotic cells in the form of gene expression libraries. Polynucleotides encoding activities of interest are isolated from such libraries and introduced into a host cell. The host cell is grown under conditions which promote recombination and or reductive reassortment creating potentially active biomolecules with novel or enhanced activities.

In vivo biopanning may be performed utilizing a FACS based and non optical e.g. magnetic based machines. Complex gene libraries are constructed with vectors which contain elements which stabilize transcribed RNA. For example the inclusion of sequences which result in secondary structures such as hairpins which are designed to flank the transcribed regions of the RNA would serve to enhance their stability thus increasing their half life within the cell. The probe molecules used in the biopanning process consist of oligonucleotides labeled with reporter molecules that only fluoresce upon binding of the probe to a target molecule. These probes are introduced into the recombinant cells from the library using one of several transformation methods. The probe molecules bind to the transcribed target mRNA resulting in DNA RNA heteroduplex molecules. Binding of the probe to a target will yield a fluorescent signal which is detected and sorted by the FACS machine during the screening process.

Additionally subcloning may be performed to further isolate sequences of interest. In subcloning a portion of DNA is amplified digested generally by restriction enzymes to cut out the desired sequence the desired sequence is ligated into a recipient vector and is amplified. At each step in subcloning the portion is examined for the activity of interest in order to ensure that DNA that encodes the structural protein has not been excluded. The insert may be purified at any step of the subcloning for example by gel electrophoresis prior to ligation into a vector or where cells containing the recipient vector and cells not containing the recipient vector are placed on selective media containing for example an antibiotic which will kill the cells not containing the recipient vector. Specific methods of subcloning cDNA inserts into vectors are well known in the art Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 . In another aspect the enzymes of the invention are subclones. Such subclones may differ from the parent clone by for example length a mutation a tag or a label.

In one aspect the signal sequences of the invention are identified following identification of a novel polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein. The pathways by which proteins are sorted and transported to their proper cellular location are often referred to as protein targeting pathways. One of the most important elements in all of these targeting systems is a short amino acid sequence at the amino terminus of a newly synthesized polypeptide called the signal sequence. This signal sequence directs a protein to its appropriate location in the cell and is removed during transport or when the protein reaches its final destination. Most lysosomal membrane or secreted proteins have an amino terminal signal sequence that marks them for translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. More than 100 signal sequences for proteins in this group have been determined. The sequences vary in length from 13 to 36 amino acid residues. Various methods of recognition of signal sequences are known to those of skill in the art. In one aspect the peptides are identified by a method referred to as SignalP. SignalP uses a combined neural network which recognizes both signal peptides and their cleavage sites. See e.g. Nielsen 1997 Identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal peptides and prediction of their cleavage sites. Protein Engineering vol. 10 no. 1 p. 1 6. It should be understood that some of the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins of the invention may or may not contain signal sequences. It may be desirable to include a nucleic acid sequence encoding a signal sequence from a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence of a different a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein may be desired.

The microorganisms from which the polynucleotide may be discovered isolated or prepared include prokaryotic microorganisms such as and and lower eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi some algae and protozoa. Polynucleotides may be discovered isolated or prepared from environmental samples in which case the nucleic acid may be recovered without culturing of an organism or recovered from one or more cultured organisms. In one aspect such microorganisms may be extremophiles such as hyperthermophiles psychrophiles psychrotrophs halophiles barophiles and acidophiles. Polynucleotides encoding enzymes isolated from extremophilic microorganisms can be used. Such enzymes may function at temperatures above 100 C. in terrestrial hot springs and deep searmal vents at temperatures below 0 C. in arctic waters in the saturated salt environment of the Dead Sea at pH values around 0 in coal deposits and geothermal sulfur rich springs or at pH values greater than 11 in sewage sludge. For example several esterases and lipases cloned and expressed from extremophilic organisms show high activity throughout a wide range of temperatures and pHs.

Polynucleotides selected and isolated as hereinabove described are introduced into a suitable host cell. A suitable host cell is any cell which is capable of promoting recombination and or reductive reassortment. The selected polynucleotides are in one aspect already in a vector which includes appropriate control sequences. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell such as a mammalian cell or a lower eukaryotic cell such as a yeast cell or in one aspect the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection DEAE Dextran mediated transfection or electroporation Davis et al. 1986 .

As representative examples of appropriate hosts there may be mentioned bacterial cells such as fungal cells such as yeast insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 animal cells such as CHO COS or Bowes melanoma adenoviruses and plant cells. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

With particular references to various mammalian cell culture systems that can be employed to express recombinant protein examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS 7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts described in SV40 transformed simian cells support the replication of early SV40 mutants Gluzman 1981 and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector for example the C127 3T3 CHO HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication a suitable promoter and enhancer and also any necessary ribosome binding sites polyadenylation site splice donor and acceptor sites transcriptional termination sequences and 5 flanking nontranscribed sequences. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 splice and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements.

In another aspect it is envisioned the method of the present invention can be used to generate novel polynucleotides encoding biochemical pathways from one or more operons or gene clusters or portions thereof. For example bacteria and many eukaryotes have a coordinated mechanism for regulating genes whose products are involved in related processes. The genes are clustered in structures referred to as gene clusters on a single chromosome and are transcribed together under the control of a single regulatory sequence including a single promoter which initiates transcription of the entire cluster. Thus a gene cluster is a group of adjacent genes that are either identical or related usually as to their function. An example of a biochemical pathway encoded by gene clusters are polyketides.

Gene cluster DNA can be isolated from different organisms and ligated into vectors particularly vectors containing expression regulatory sequences which can control and regulate the production of a detectable protein or protein related array activity from the ligated gene clusters. Use of vectors which have an exceptionally large capacity for exogenous DNA introduction are particularly appropriate for use with such gene clusters and are described by way of example herein to include the f factor or fertility factor of . This f factor of is a plasmid which affects high frequency transfer of itself during conjugation and is ideal to achieve and stably propagate large DNA fragments such as gene clusters from mixed microbial samples. One aspect is to use cloning vectors referred to as fosmids or bacterial artificial chromosome BAC vectors. These are derived from f factor which is able to stably integrate large segments of genomic DNA. When integrated with DNA from a mixed uncultured environmental sample this makes it possible to achieve large genomic fragments in the form of a stable environmental DNA library. Another type of vector for use in the present invention is a cosmid vector. Cosmid vectors were originally designed to clone and propagate large segments of genomic DNA. Cloning into cosmid vectors is described in detail in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 . Once ligated into an appropriate vector two or more vectors containing different polyketide synthase gene clusters can be introduced into a suitable host cell. Regions of partial sequence homology shared by the gene clusters will promote processes which result in sequence reorganization resulting in a hybrid gene cluster. The novel hybrid gene cluster can then be screened for enhanced activities not found in the original gene clusters.

Methods for screening for various enzyme activities are known to those of skill in the art and are discussed throughout the present specification. Such methods may be employed when isolating the polypeptides and polynucleotides of the invention.

In one aspect the invention provides methods for discovering and isolating polypeptides enzymes proteins e.g. structural or binding proteins or compounds to modify the enzymatic activity using a whole cell approach. Putative clones encoding polypeptides enzymes proteins e.g. structural or binding proteins from genomic DNA library can be screened.

In practicing the methods of the invention a variety of apparatus and methodologies can be used to in conjunction with the polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention e.g. to screen polypeptides for a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity to screen compounds as potential modulators e.g. activators or inhibitors of an enzyme structural or binding activity for antibodies that bind to a polypeptide of the invention for nucleic acids that hybridize to a nucleic acid of the invention to screen for cells expressing a polypeptide of the invention and the like. In addition to the array formats described in detail below for screening samples alternative formats can also be used to practice the methods of the invention. Such formats include for example mass spectrometers chromatographs e.g. high throughput HPLC and other forms of liquid chromatography and smaller formats such as 1536 well plates 384 well plates and so on. High throughput screening apparatus can be adapted and used to practice the methods of the invention see e.g. U.S. Patent Application No. 20020001809.

Nucleic acids or polypeptides of the invention can be immobilized to or applied to an array. Arrays can be used to screen for or monitor libraries of compositions e.g. small molecules antibodies nucleic acids etc. for their ability to bind to or modulate the activity of a nucleic acid or a polypeptide of the invention. Capillary arrays such as the GIGAMATRIX Diversa Corporation San Diego Calif. and arrays described in e.g. U.S. Patent Application No. 20020080350 A1 WO 0231203 A WO 0244336 A provide an alternative apparatus for holding and screening samples. In one aspect the capillary array includes a plurality of capillaries formed into an array of adjacent capillaries wherein each capillary comprises at least one wall defining a lumen for retaining a sample. The lumen may be cylindrical square hexagonal or any other geometric shape so long as the walls form a lumen for retention of a liquid or sample. The capillaries of the capillary array can be held together in close proximity to form a planar structure. The capillaries can be bound together by being fused e.g. where the capillaries are made of glass glued bonded or clamped side by side. Additionally the capillary array can include interstitial material disposed between adjacent capillaries in the array thereby forming a solid planar device containing a plurality of through holes.

A capillary array can be formed of any number of individual capillaries for example a range from 100 to 4 000 000 capillaries. Further a capillary array having about 100 000 or more individual capillaries can be formed into the standard size and shape of a Microtiter plate for fitment into standard laboratory equipment. The lumens are filled manually or automatically using either capillary action or microinjection using a thin needle. Samples of interest may subsequently be removed from individual capillaries for further analysis or characterization. For example a thin needle like probe is positioned in fluid communication with a selected capillary to either add or withdraw material from the lumen.

In a single pot screening assay the assay components are mixed yielding a solution of interest prior to insertion into the capillary array. The lumen is filled by capillary action when at least a portion of the array is immersed into a solution of interest. Chemical or biological reactions and or activity in each capillary are monitored for detectable events. A detectable event is often referred to as a hit which can usually be distinguished from non hit producing capillaries by optical detection. Thus capillary arrays allow for massively parallel detection of hits .

In a multi pot screening assay a polypeptide or nucleic acid e.g. a ligand can be introduced into a first component which is introduced into at least a portion of a capillary of a capillary array. An air bubble can then be introduced into the capillary behind the first component. A second component can then be introduced into the capillary wherein the second component is separated from the first component by the air bubble. The first and second components can then be mixed by applying hydrostatic pressure to both sides of the capillary array to collapse the bubble. The capillary array is then monitored for a detectable event resulting from reaction or non reaction of the two components.

In a binding screening assay a sample of interest can be introduced as a first liquid labeled with a detectable particle into a capillary of a capillary array wherein the lumen of the capillary is coated with a binding material for binding the detectable particle to the lumen. The first liquid may then be removed from the capillary tube wherein the bound detectable particle is maintained within the capillary and a second liquid may be introduced into the capillary tube. The capillary is then monitored for a detectable event resulting from reaction or non reaction of the particle with the second liquid.

Nucleic acids or polypeptides of the invention can be immobilized to or applied to an array. Arrays can be used to screen for or monitor libraries of compositions e.g. small molecules antibodies nucleic acids etc. for their ability to bind to or modulate the activity of a nucleic acid or a polypeptide of the invention. For example in one aspect of the invention a monitored parameter is transcript expression of a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein gene. One or more or all the transcripts of a cell can be measured by hybridization of a sample comprising transcripts of the cell or nucleic acids representative of or complementary to transcripts of a cell by hybridization to immobilized nucleic acids on an array or biochip. By using an array of nucleic acids on a microchip some or all of the transcripts of a cell can be simultaneously quantified. Alternatively arrays comprising genomic nucleic acid can also be used to determine the genotype of a newly engineered strain made by the methods of the invention. Polypeptide arrays can also be used to simultaneously quantify a plurality of proteins. The present invention can be practiced with any known array also referred to as a microarray or nucleic acid array or polypeptide array or antibody array or biochip or variation thereof. Arrays are generically a plurality of spots or target elements each target element comprising a defined amount of one or more biological molecules e.g. oligonucleotides immobilized onto a defined area of a substrate surface for specific binding to a sample molecule e.g. mRNA transcripts.

The terms array or microarray or biochip or chip as used herein is a plurality of target elements each target element comprising a defined amount of one or more polypeptides including antibodies or nucleic acids immobilized onto a defined area of a substrate surface as discussed in further detail below.

The term antibody includes a peptide or polypeptide derived from modeled after or substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or immunoglobulin genes or fragments thereof capable of specifically binding an antigen or epitope see e.g. Fundamental Immunology Third Edition W. E. Paul ed. Raven Press N.Y. 1993 Wilson 1994 J. Immunol. Methods 175 267 273 Yarmush 1992 J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 25 85 97.

Single chain antibodies are also included by reference in the term antibody. 

The antibodies can be used in immunoprecipitation staining immunoaffinity columns and the like. If desired nucleic acid sequences encoding for specific antigens can be generated by immunization followed by isolation of polypeptide or nucleic acid amplification or cloning and immobilization of polypeptide onto an array of the invention. Alternatively the methods of the invention can be used to modify the structure of an antibody produced by a cell to be modified e.g. an antibody s affinity can be increased or decreased. Furthermore the ability to make or modify antibodies can be a phenotype engineered into a cell by the methods of the invention.

Methods of immunization producing and isolating antibodies polyclonal and monoclonal are known to those of skill in the art and described in the scientific and patent literature see e.g. Coligan CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY Wiley Greene NY 1991 Stites eds. BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 7th ed. Lange Medical Publications Los Altos Calif. Stites Goding MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE 2d ed. Academic Press New York N.Y. 1986 Kohler 1975 Nature 256 495 Harlow 1988 ANTIBODIES A LABORATORY MANUAL Cold Spring Harbor Publications New York. Antibodies also can be generated in vitro e.g. using recombinant antibody binding site expressing phage display libraries in addition to the traditional in vivo methods using animals. See e.g. Hoogenboom 1997 Trends Biotechnol. 15 62 70 Katz 1997 Annu Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 26 27 45.

The polypeptides of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 consecutive amino acids thereof may also be used to generate antibodies which bind specifically to the polypeptides or fragments. The resulting antibodies may be used in immunoaffinity chromatography procedures to isolate or purify the polypeptide or to determine whether the polypeptide is present in a biological sample. In such procedures a protein preparation such as an extract or a biological sample is contacted with an antibody capable of specifically binding to one of the polypeptides of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 consecutive amino acids thereof.

In immunoaffinity procedures the antibody is attached to a solid support such as a bead or other column matrix. The protein preparation is placed in contact with the antibody under conditions in which the antibody specifically binds to one of the polypeptides of the invention or fragment thereof. After a wash to remove non specifically bound proteins the specifically bound polypeptides are eluted.

The ability of proteins in a biological sample to bind to the antibody may be determined using any of a variety of procedures familiar to those skilled in the art. For example binding may be determined by labeling the antibody with a detectable label such as a fluorescent agent an enzymatic label or a radioisotope. Alternatively binding of the antibody to the sample may be detected using a secondary antibody having such a detectable label thereon. Particular assays include ELISA assays sandwich assays radioimmunoassays and Western Blots.

Polyclonal antibodies generated against the polypeptides of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 consecutive amino acids thereof can be obtained by direct injection of the polypeptides into an animal or by administering the polypeptides to an animal for example a nonhuman. The antibody so obtained can bind the polypeptide itself. In this manner even a sequence encoding only a fragment of the polypeptide can be used to generate antibodies which may bind to the whole native polypeptide. Such antibodies can then be used to isolate the polypeptide from cells expressing that polypeptide.

For preparation of monoclonal antibodies any technique which provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures can be used. Examples include the hybridoma technique Kohler and Milstein Nature 256 495 497 1975 the trioma technique the human B cell hybridoma technique Kozbor et al. Immunology Today 4 72 1983 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 .

No. 4 946 778 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 consecutive amino acids thereof. Alternatively transgenic mice may be used to express humanized antibodies to these polypeptides or fragments thereof.

Antibodies generated against the polypeptides of the invention or fragments comprising at least 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 75 100 or 150 consecutive amino acids thereof may be used in screening for similar polypeptides from other organisms and samples. In such techniques polypeptides from the organism are contacted with the antibody and those polypeptides which specifically bind the antibody are detected. Any of the procedures described above may be used to detect antibody binding. One such screening assay is described in Methods for Measuring Cellulase Activities Vol 160 pp. 87 116.

The invention provides kits comprising the compositions e.g. nucleic acids expression cassettes vectors cells transgenic seeds or plants or plant parts polypeptides and or antibodies of the invention. The kits also can contain instructional material teaching the methodologies and uses of the enzymes of the invention see e.g. Table 3 including the industrial experimental food and feed processing and medical uses of the compositions and methods of the invention as described herein.

The methods of the invention provide whole cell evolution or whole cell engineering of a cell to develop a new cell strain having a new phenotype e.g. a new or modified a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein activity by modifying the genetic composition of the cell. The genetic composition can be modified by addition to the cell of a nucleic acid of the invention e.g. a coding sequence for an enzyme of the invention. See e.g. WO0229032 WO0196551.

To detect the new phenotype at least one metabolic parameter of a modified cell is monitored in the cell in a real time or on line time frame. In one aspect a plurality of cells such as a cell culture is monitored in real time or on line. In one aspect a plurality of metabolic parameters is monitored in real time or on line. Metabolic parameters can be monitored using the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding proteins of the invention.

Metabolic flux analysis MFA is based on a known biochemistry framework. A linearly independent metabolic matrix is constructed based on the law of mass conservation and on the pseudo steady state hypothesis PSSH on the intracellular metabolites. In practicing the methods of the invention metabolic networks are established including the 

Once the metabolic network for a given strain is built mathematic presentation by matrix notion can be introduced to estimate the intracellular metabolic fluxes if the on line metabolome data is available. Metabolic phenotype relies on the changes of the whole metabolic network within a cell. Metabolic phenotype relies on the change of pathway utilization with respect to environmental conditions genetic regulation developmental state and the genotype etc. In one aspect of the methods of the invention after the on line MFA calculation the dynamic behavior of the cells their phenotype and other properties are analyzed by investigating the pathway utilization. For example if the glucose supply is increased and the oxygen decreased during the yeast fermentation the utilization of respiratory pathways will be reduced and or stopped and the utilization of the fermentative pathways will dominate. Control of physiological state of cell cultures will become possible after the pathway analysis. The methods of the invention can help determine how to manipulate the fermentation by determining how to change the substrate supply temperature use of inducers etc. to control the physiological state of cells to move along desirable direction. In practicing the methods of the invention the MFA results can also be compared with transcriptome and proteome data to design experiments and protocols for metabolic engineering or gene shuffling etc.

In practicing the methods of the invention any modified or new phenotype can be conferred and detected including new or improved characteristics in the cell. Any aspect of metabolism or growth can be monitored.

In one aspect of the invention the engineered phenotype comprises increasing or decreasing the expression of an mRNA transcript e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein message or generating new e.g. polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein transcripts in a cell.

J. Haematol. 114 313 318 Xia 2001 Transplantation 72 907 914 .

In one aspect of the invention the engineered phenotype is generated by knocking out expression of a homologous gene. The gene s coding sequence or one or more transcriptional control elements can be knocked out e.g. promoters or enhancers. Thus the expression of a transcript can be completely ablated or only decreased.

In one aspect of the invention the engineered phenotype comprises increasing the expression of a homologous gene. This can be effected by knocking out of a negative control element including a transcriptional regulatory element acting in cis or trans or mutagenizing a positive control element.

In one aspect of the invention the engineered phenotype comprises increasing or decreasing the expression of a polypeptide e.g. a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein or generating new polypeptides in a cell.

A formulation which includes dietary supplements can be admixtured with nontoxic pharmaceutically or orally acceptable excipients which are suitable for manufacture. Formulations may comprise one or more diluents emulsifiers preservatives buffers excipients etc. and may be provided in such forms as liquids powders emulsions lyophilized powders sprays creams lotions controlled release formulations tablets pills gels on patches in implants etc.

Pharmaceutical formulations and dietary supplements for oral administration can be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in appropriate and suitable dosages. Such carriers enable the pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements to be formulated in unit dosage forms as tablets pills powder dragees capsules liquids lozenges gels syrups slurries suspensions etc. suitable for ingestion by the patient. Pharmaceutical preparations and dietary supplements for oral use can be formulated as a solid excipient optionally grinding a resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable additional compounds if desired to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable solid excipients are carbohydrate or protein fillers include e.g. sugars including lactose sucrose mannitol or sorbitol starch from corn wheat rice potato or other plants cellulose such as methyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose or sodium carboxy methylcellulose and gums including arabic and tragacanth and proteins e.g. gelatin and collagen.

By using liposomes particularly where the liposome surface carries ligands specific for target cells or are otherwise preferentially directed to a specific organ one can focus the delivery of the active agent into target cells in vivo. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 063 400 6 007 839 Al Muhammed 1996 J. Microencapsul. 13 293 306 Chonn 1995 Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 6 698 708 Ostro 1989 Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 46 1576 1587.

In the methods of the invention a pharmaceutical composition is administered in an amount sufficient to treat e.g. ameliorate or prevent a disease related condition a diseases or a symptoms or to decrease or increase the amount of substance in a body fluid such as blood serum CSF and the like. The amount of composition e.g. pharmaceutical compositions formulations including dietary supplements adequate to accomplish this is defined as a therapeutically effective dose. The dosage schedule and amounts effective for this use i.e. the dosing regimen will depend upon a variety of factors including the stage of the disease or condition the severity of the disease or condition the general state of the patient s health the patient s physical status age and the like. In calculating the dosage regimen for a patient the mode of administration also is taken into consideration.

The dosage regimen also takes into consideration pharmacokinetics parameters well known in the art i.e. the active agents rate of absorption bioavailability metabolism clearance and the like see e.g. Hidalgo Aragones 1996 J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 58 611 617 Groning 1996 Pharmazie 51 337 341 Fotherby 1996 Contraception 54 59 69 Johnson 1995 J. Pharm. Sci. 84 1144 1146 Rohatagi 1995 Pharmazie 50 610 613 Brophy 1983 Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 24 103 108 the latest Remington s supra . The state of the art allows the clinician to determine the dosage regimen for each individual patient active agent and disease or condition treated. Guidelines provided for similar compositions used as pharmaceuticals can be used as guidance to determine the dosage regiment i.e. dose schedule and dosage levels administered practicing the methods of the invention are correct and appropriate.

Single or multiple administrations of compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions formulations including dietary supplements of the invention can be given depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. The compositions should provide a sufficient quantity of active agent to effectively treat ameliorate or prevent PKU or other PKU related conditions diseases or symptoms. For example an exemplary pharmaceutical formulation for oral administration of a protein of the invention is in a daily amount of between about 0.1 to 0.5 to about 20 50 100 or 1000 or more ug per kilogram of body weight per day. In an alternative embodiment dosages are from about 1 mg to about 4 mg per kg of body weight per patient per day are used. Lower dosages can be used in contrast to administration orally into the blood stream into a body cavity or into a lumen of an organ.

Alternatively feed additives of the invention can form a component of a pre mix. The granulated enzyme product of the invention may be coated or uncoated. The particle size of the enzyme granulates can be compatible with that of feed and pre mix components. This provides a safe and convenient mean of incorporating enzymes into feeds. Alternatively the animal feed additive of the invention may be a stabilized liquid composition. This may be an aqueous or oil based slurry. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 546.

A polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the present invention in the modification of animal feed or a food can process the food or feed either in vitro by modifying components of the feed or food or in vivo. Polypeptides of the invention can be added to animal feed or food compositions.

In one aspect an enzyme of the invention has any of the following enzyme activities or is added in combination with another enzyme e.g. beta galactosidases catalases laccases cellulases endoglycosidases endo beta 1 4 laccases amyloglucosidases glucose isomerases glycosyltransferases lipases phospholipases lipooxygenases beta laccases endo beta 1 3 4 laccases cutinases peroxidases amylases glucoamylases pectinases reductases oxidases decarboxylases phenoloxidases ligninases pullulanases arabinanases hemicellulases mannanases xylolaccases xylanases pectin acetyl esterases rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterases proteases peptidases proteinases polygalacturonases rhamnogalacturonases galactanases pectin lyases transglutaminases pectin methylesterases cellobiohydrolases and or transglutaminases. These enzyme digestion products are more digestible by the animal. Thus a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention can contribute to the available energy of the feed or food. Also a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention can improve the digestibility and uptake of carbohydrate and non carbohydrate feed or food constituents such as protein fat and minerals.

In another aspect a polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein of the invention can be supplied by expressing the enzymes directly in transgenic feed crops as e.g. transgenic plants seeds and the like such as grains cereals corn soy bean rape seed lupin and the like.

Alternatively the plant or plant part containing the recombinant polypeptide can be used as such for improving the quality of a food or feed e.g. improving nutritional value palatability etc.

The enzyme delivery matrix of the invention is in the form of discrete plural particles pellets or granules. By granules is meant particles that are compressed or compacted such as by a pelletizing extrusion or similar compacting to remove water from the matrix. Such compression or compacting of the particles also promotes intraparticle cohesion of the particles. For example the granules can be prepared by pelletizing the grain based substrate in a pellet mill. The pellets prepared thereby are ground or crumbled to a granule size suitable for use as an adjuvant in animal feed. Since the matrix is itself approved for use in animal feed it can be used as a diluent for delivery of enzymes in animal feed.

The polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein contained in the invention enzyme delivery matrix and methods is in one aspect thermostable polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein as described herein so as to resist inactivation of the polypeptide enzyme protein e.g. structural or binding protein during manufacture where elevated temperatures and or steam may be employed to prepare the palletized enzyme delivery matrix. During digestion of feed containing the invention enzyme delivery matrix aqueous digestive fluids will cause release of the active enzyme. Other types of thermostable enzymes and nutritional supplements that are thermostable can also be incorporated in the delivery matrix for release under any type of aqueous conditions.

A coating can be applied to the invention enzyme matrix particles for many different purposes such as to add a flavor or nutrition supplement to animal feed to delay release of animal feed supplements and enzymes in gastric conditions and the like. Or the coating may be applied to achieve a functional goal for example whenever it is desirable to slow release of the enzyme from the matrix particles or to control the conditions under which the enzyme will be released. The composition of the coating material can be such that it is selectively broken down by an agent to which it is susceptible such as heat acid or base enzymes or other chemicals .

The mold inhibitor and cohesiveness agent when used can be added at any suitable time and in one aspect are mixed with the grain based substrate in the desired proportions prior to pelletizing of the grain based substrate. Moisture content in the pellet mill feed in one aspect is in the ranges set forth above with respect to the moisture content in the finished product and in one aspect is about 14 15 . In one aspect moisture is added to the feedstock in the form of an aqueous preparation of the enzyme to bring the feedstock to this moisture content. The temperature in the pellet mill in one aspect is brought to about 82 C. with steam. The pellet mill may be operated under any conditions that impart sufficient work to the feedstock to provide pellets. The pelleting process itself is a cost effective process for removing water from the enzyme containing composition.

The compositions and methods of the invention can be used to make cocoa butter alternatives by structured synthetic techniques using the enzymes of the invention e.g. as described in Tables 1 2 and 3 including esterases acylases lipases phospholipases or proteases of the invention. For example in one aspect the methods of the invention process or synthesize triacylglycerides diacylglycerides and or monoacylglycerides for use as e.g. cocoa butter alternatives. In one aspect the methods of the invention generate a hard butter with a defined plastic region to maintain sufficient hardness below or at room temperature. In one aspect the processed or synthesized lipid is designed to have a very narrow plastic region e.g. in one aspect where it rapidly melts at about body temperature. Natural cacao butter begins to soften at approximately 30 C. to 32 C. and completely melts at approximately 36 C. Natural cacao butter can contain 70 wt or more of three 1 3 disaturated 2 oleoyl glycerols which are 1 3 dipalmitoyl 2 oleoyl glycerol POP 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl glycerol POSt and 1 3 distearoyl 2 oleoyl glycerol StOSt . These three glycerols show a similar melting behavior to each other and are responsible for melting properties of the cacao butter exhibiting a very narrow plastic region. The invention provides synthetic cacao butters or processed cacao butters synthesized or processed using a hydrolase of the invention all possible composition are referred to as cocoa butter alternatives with varying percentages of 3 dipalmitoyl 2 oleoyl glycerol POP 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl glycerol POSt and 1 3 distearoyl 2 oleoyl glycerol StOSt depending on the desired properties of the synthetic cacao butter and synthetic cacao butters with more or less than 70 wt of the three 1 3 disaturated 2 oleoyl glycerols. The synthetic cacao butters of the invention can partially or completely replace natural or unprocessed cacao butters and can maintain or improve essential hard butter properties.

The invention provides synthetic cacao butters or processed cacao butters synthesized or processed using a hydrolase of the invention with desired properties for use in confectionary bakery and pharmaceutical products. In one aspect the invention provides confectionary bakery and pharmaceutical products comprising a hydrolase of the invention. In one aspect the methods of the invention make or process a lipid a fat from a confection e.g. a chocolate or to be used in a confection. In one aspect a lipid is made or processed such that the chocolate shows less finger imprinting than chocolate made from natural cocoa butter while still having sharp melting characteristics in the mouth. In one aspect a lipid is made or processed such that a confection e.g. chocolate can be made at a comparatively high ambient temperature or be made using a cooling water at a comparatively high temperature. In one aspect the lipid is made or processed such that a confection e.g. chocolate can be stored under relatively warmer conditions e.g. tropical or semi tropical conditions or in centrally heated buildings. In one aspect the lipids are made or processed such that a confection e.g. chocolate will have a lipid fat content of consistent composition and quality. The enzymes of the invention can be used to provide a substitute composition for cacao butter which can significantly improve its thermal stability and replace it in a wide range of applications.

The invention provides synthetic or processed fats e.g. margarine and shortening synthesized or processed using an enzyme of the invention e.g. as described in Tables 1 2 and 3 such as a hydrolase of the invention. In one aspect the invention provides processed fats comprising a vegetable oil such as soybean oil corn oil rapeseed oil palm oil or lauric type oils synthesized or processed using a hydrolase of the invention. The synthetic or processed fats e.g. margarine and shortening are designed to have a desired plasticity. Many of the plastic fat products such as margarine and shortening are produced from hard stocks and liquid oils as raw materials. For example liquid oils such as soybean oil corn oil palm oil and rapeseed oil are blended with their hardened oils hard stocks and the blend is adjusted to have an appropriate consistency plasticity . The plastic fat products such as margarine and shortening so produced tend to cause the formation of relatively coarse crystallines because fats and oils used as the raw materials are composed of fatty acids having almost the same carbon chain length. In other words they have a highly unified composition of fatty acids. For this reason the plasticity of these products can be maintained at an appropriate degree only within a narrow temperature range so that the liquid oils contained therein have a tendency to exude. In one aspect the invention provides methods of making or processing fats designed such that they have a varied and defined composition of fatty acids. The resultant oil e.g. margarine or shortening can have a broader range of plasticity.

In one aspect the methods and compositions of the invention are used to make or process vegetable oils such as soybean oil corn oil rapeseed oil palm oil or lauric type oils using the hydrolases of the invention including inter esterification and enzymatic transesterification see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 288 619. The methods and compositions of the invention can be used in place of random inter esterification as described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 949 105. In one aspect the methods and compositions of the invention are used to in enzymatic transesterification for preparing an oil e.g. a margarine oil having both low trans acid and low intermediate chain fatty acid content.

In one aspect the symmetric structure of an oil e.g. a palm or lauric type oils is modified e.g. into a random structure. Thus the methods of the invention can be used to modify the properties of plastic fat products. In one aspect the modification of oils by the methods of the invention can be designed to prevent or slow gradually hardening of the oil with time particularly when the products are being stored.

In one aspect the methods and compositions of the invention in a trans esterification reaction mixture comprising a stearic acid source material and an edible liquid vegetable oil trans esterifying the stearic acid source material and the vegetable oil using a 1 3 positionally specific lipase of the invention and then hydrogenating the fatty acid mixture to provide a recycle stearic acid source material for a recyclic reaction with the vegetable oil. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 288 619.

In one aspect an inter esterification reaction is conducted with a lipase of the invention. In one aspect the lipase of the invention has a selectivity for the 1 and 3 positions of triglyceride to slow or inhibit an increase in the amount of tri saturated triglycerides in the oil. In this reaction of the invention deficiencies of conventional random inter esterification and the difficulty of inter esterification with a non specific lipase can be overcome because the inter esterification is conducted by an enzyme of the invention having a specificity for the 1 and 3 positions of triglycerides. In one aspect the exudation of liquid oils contained in the products is slowed or prevented with a temperature increase in the reaction to inhibit a rise in the melting point caused by an increase in the amount of tri saturated triglycerides. This addresses the problem of hardening of products during long term storage.

The invention provides methods of brewing e.g. fermenting beer comprising hydrolases of the invention. In one exemplary process starch containing raw materials are disintegrated and processed to form a malt. A hydrolase of the invention is used at any point in the fermentation process. For example hydrolases e.g. proteases of the invention can be used in the processing of barley malt. The major raw material of beer brewing is barley malt. This can be a three stage process. First the barley grain can be steeped to increase water content e.g. to around about 40 .
