The present invention relates generally to the field of content presentation and more particularly to control of content presentation based on audience feedback.

An important aspect of the art of the presentation is to keep the presentation relevant. This is typically accomplished by adjusting the content and flow of a presentation to tailor it to the target audience. In order to tailor the presentation information is gathered from the audience typically post presentation usually in the form of solicited feedback from a survey or request for comments. Systems also exist to receive audience feedback during a presentation such as a simple raise your hand response to a question from the presenter or more sophisticated systems such as electronic instant polling devices given to audience members. Useful information may also be obtained from observing the audience during a presentation for example for behavioral signs indicating level of interest and from ad hoc audience communications such as audience questions during the presentations and audience comments to the presenter after the presentation. In response to the gathered information future presentations can be adjusted to better address the perceived audience interest in various aspects of the presentation. If the presenter is adept adjustments to the presentation can be made on the fly for example by verbally expounding on certain perceived areas of audience interest or fast forwarding through portions of the presentation perceived to be of low audience interest.

Embodiments of the present invention disclose a method computer program product and system for selecting presentation content. Presentation content is displayed to an audience the presentation content includes a plurality of content elements. One or more feedback inputs are received from the audience each feedback input is associated with one of the content elements.

Embodiments of the present invention generally describe a presentation control system in which audience members provide feedback during a presentation to a presentation program on a computing device via audience feedback devices. The feedback is on a content element level which includes presentation elements such as a slide bullets and control elements such as slide level feedback buttons and can include for example an indication that the audience member would like the presenter to go into more depth on a particular point or to skip over a particular point. If enough specific feedback is received the presentation program can offer the presenter one or more alternative slide arrangements for the remainder of the presentation. If the presenter chooses one of the alternative presentations the presentation program will display the new presentation to the audience.

The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the Figures. is a functional block diagram illustrating a presentation control system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment presentation control system includes computing device for use by a presenter and feedback devices A through N which are connected to computing device . In exemplary embodiments feedback devices A through N can be directly connected to computing device for example via wired or wireless connections or through a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN such as the Internet or a combination of the networks and can include wired wireless or fiber optic connections.

Feedback devices represent devices accessible by audience members viewing a presentation for example on projection screen that allow the audience members to provide feedback to presentation program described below . In a preferred embodiment a feedback device is a computing device that displays a presentation and allows for user selection of a content element such as a slide bullet. In a first exemplary embodiment a feedback device is a PC style computing device for example a netbook notebook or laptop computer. In this embodiment user selection of a content element can be accomplished for example by clicking or right clicking on the portion of the presentation with a mouse device or with a keypad device. In a second exemplary embodiment a feedback device is a tablet style computing device for example the iPad by Apple Inc. having a touch screen user interface. In this embodiment user selection of a content element can be accomplished for example by touching the screen at the location that the content element is displayed. In general feedback devices can be any device capable of allowing an audience member to provide feedback on a content element in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

In certain embodiments user selection of a content element causes display of a feedback menu by which the audience member will register his her feedback. In other embodiments the selection of a content element causes feedback to be registered. For example selection of a content element always indicates that the audience member would like additional presentation material related to the selected content element.

In various embodiments of the present invention computing device which is described in more detail below with respect to can be a laptop computer tablet computer netbook computer personal computer PC a desktop computer or any programmable electronic device capable of communicating with feedback devices and supporting the functionality required of embodiments of the invention.

In a preferred embodiment computing device includes presentation program which further includes presentation control module feedback analysis module and presentation store . Presentation store stores the presentation content of one or more presentations. In an exemplary embodiment presentation content is one or more slides for example slide and a presentation is an arrangement of one or more slides. For example popular slide based presentation formats include PowerPoint by Microsoft Corporation and Impress part of the OpenOffice software suite by The Apache Software Foundation. In preferred embodiments one or more slides are associated with a presentation but are not included in the presentation. For example the associated slides may contain content that can optionally be included in the presentation. The optional content can be for example additional explanatory presentation material or additional material not included in the presentation. While the exemplary embodiment describes presentation content as slides other forms of presentation content can be used. For example the presentation content can include embedded or linked video or video segments animation sound files or slide presentations with highly animated transitions within and between slides. In general any presentation content may be used that satisfies requirements of embodiments of the invention.

Feedback analysis module operates to receive and process feedback from feedback devices . In a preferred embodiment feedback analysis module identifies categorizes and tabulates audience member feedback inputs and determines if an alternative presentation content is indicated. For example in response to the display of slide to an audience on projection screen one or more audience members may select slide bullet via their feedback devices and in response to the display of menu select the Describe More option. Indications of these feedback menu selection choices are transmitted to feedback analysis module . Feedback analysis module then determines for example if the number of Describe More feedback inputs related to slide bullet are above a threshold value and if so determines an alternative presentation content for the remainder of the presentation. As mentioned above in certain embodiments feedback can be in the form of natural language input for example comments entered by keyboard or keypad input via feedback devices . In these embodiments for example the feedback analysis module would process the natural language input and appropriately categorize the feedback such that it can be used in the determination of whether and which alternative presentation content is indicated. In general feedback analysis module can determine whether an alternative presentation content is indicated and what the alternative presentation content should be based on logical and arithmetical combinations and comparisons of audience feedback inputs from a current presentation content such as a slide currently being displayed feedback inputs from previously displayed presentation content in the current presentation and feedback inputs from previous presentations of the same content.

Table 1 shows a rule based example of several alternative presentation contents that may be applied to a presentation by feedback analysis module in response to audience feedback inputs for slide 1 of a presentation received via feedback devices . For example if audience feedback received by feedback analysis module indicates that the audience wants more description for presentation element 1 indicated in the table as E1 optional slides and residing in presentation store can be inserted after slide 2 indicated in the table as A2 . Similarly if audience feedback indicates that the audience wants less description for presentation element 2 indicated in the table as E2 slides 3 and 4 can be removed from the presentation indicated in the table as 3 4 .

Presentation control module operates to cause the display of a presentation for example on projection screen and on feedback devices . Presentation control module can also operate to change the presentation content of the remainder of a presentation such as adding or removing slides and change the order of the presentation content based on control information provided by feedback analysis module . Presentation control module also operates to display to the presenter indications of alternative presentation contents and a mechanism by which the presenter can select an alternative presentation content.

With respect to the embodiment of presenter sees the alternative presentation contents for example and on a display of computing device and can select one or the other or neither by for example the click of a mouse or touching the display screen. As additional audience feedback inputs are received and processed by feedback analysis module typically as the presentation progresses additional alternative presentation contents relative to the current content being displayed will be determined and displayed to presenter in alternative presentation selection display area . The information displayed within alternative presentation selection display area can be in any visual display format or style that allows for presenter to select an alternative presentation content. In preferred embodiments the format shows the current presentation content and alternative presentation contents indicating the specific audience feedback that caused the identification of an alternative content and a visual indication of changes in the alternative presentation content over the current presentation content.

The feedback inputs are then compared against threshold values to determine if alternative presentation content is indicated step . As mentioned above feedback analysis module can determine whether an alternative presentation content is indicated and what the alternative presentation content should be based on logical and arithmetical combinations and comparisons of audience feedback inputs from a current presentation content such as a slide currently being displayed feedback inputs from previous presentation content in the current presentation and feedback inputs from previous presentations of the same content.

If the feedback inputs for one or more presentation elements or slides are not above a threshold value decision step No branch then feedback analysis module continues to tally the received feedback inputs step . If the feedback inputs for one or more presentation elements or slides are above a threshold value decision step Yes branch then an alternative presentation content is determined step . In an exemplary embodiment the alternative presentation content is determined from a rules based analysis which can use for example a set of rules such as shown in Table 1.

After alternative presentation contents are determined step selectable alternative presentation content control elements are displayed on a display of computing device such that presenter may select one of the alternative presentation contents step . If an alternative presentation content is selected decision step Yes branch then the current presentation is modified to reflect the alternative presentation content and presentation control module causes the new content to be displayed to the audience on for example projection screen step . If an alternative presentation content is not selected decision step No branch then feedback analysis module continues to tally the received feedback inputs step .
