title: Common data format in knowledge-based authentication
abstract: An improved technique involves converting facts from multiple fact sources to a common data format. Along these lines, for each fact source having a source-specific format, a KBA system provides an adaptor that converts incoming facts in the source-specific format to the common data format prior to generating questions. The KBA system stores the facts in the common format in a database for subsequent access. In response to an authorization request, the KBA system then builds questions based on the facts from multiple sources in the common data format stored in the database.

In knowledge based authentication KBA an organization questions a user for particular personal information. Such questions may include when were you married what was the make and model of your first car and what was the name of your first pet . The user must answer the question correctly in order to prove to the organization that he or she is not an imposter.

A conventional KBA service provider forms the questions that an organization presents to users from data acquired through an information source. Examples of a suitable information source include credit bureaus public records and corporate data. The conventional KBA service provider forms a set of questions from a suitable information source.

Along these lines suppose that a conventional KBA service provider retrieves emails from a Microsoft Exchange server. When an organization wishes to authenticate a user within the organization the KBA system retrieves an email to the user discussing a meeting with another person at a particular time and place. The KBA system forms questions from data in the email e.g. With whom did you meet in Conference Room A at 10 AM last Thursday .

Unfortunately there are deficiencies with the above described conventional KBA service providers. For example a conventional KBA service provider forms questions from each information source independently from the other information sources. A reason for this lies in the fact that data formats used by different information sources tend to be incompatible.

A consequence of this data format incompatibility is that questions provided by conventional KBA service providers may be limited in scope or have contradictory answers. Along these lines suppose that a conventional KBA service provider retrieves for a corporate organization emails from a Microsoft Exchange server. When the organization wishes to authenticate a first person within the organization the KBA system retrieves an email to the first person discussing a dinner meeting with a second person at a particular time and place. Sometime later the KBA system retrieves an expense report from an SAP database detailing a dinner meeting involving the first person the second person and a third person outside of the organization the dinner meeting is at the particular time specified in the email but happens at a different place e.g. the participants changes their minds at the last minute . An answer to a question regarding the dinner meeting may be right or wrong depending on whether the question was derived from the email or the expense report.

One workaround to such a problem may be to apply post processing operations on sets of questions to find contradictory information such as that described above. A difficulty with this workaround however is that program logic for the post processing operations can become excessively complicated. Such complexity would inhibit conventional KBA service providers from generating questions to a person directly in response to an authentication request.

In addition it is very difficult to integrate new information sources into a conventional KBA service provider. It is not uncommon for such an integration project to consume a year of effort even in a simple case such as replacing one information source with another having the same data but in different formats. The difficulty stems in adapting the question building logic to different platforms immense effort is required in identifying data structures from and adapting name resolution and internationalization to the new source.

In contrast to conventional systems conventional KBA service providers in which it is difficult to form a robust set of questions from multiple information sources an improved technique involves converting facts from multiple fact sources to a common data format. Along these lines for each fact source having a source specific format a KBA system provides an adaptor that converts incoming facts in the source specific format to the common data format prior to generating questions. The KBA system stores the facts in the common format in a database for subsequent access. In response to an authorization request the KBA system then builds questions based on the facts from multiple sources in the common data format stored in the database.

Advantageously the improved technique allows for the KBA system to provide more robust questions to a user requesting authorization. A reason for this is that facts from all fact sources are presented together in the same format as entries in a database. It is simpler for the KBA system to apply logical rules in the question building process to deal with contradictions between two sources of data than it is to determine which of a set of contradicting questions to present to the user.

Further the individual fact sources do not need to be integrated into the complex logic of the question builder. The adaptors provided by the KBA system of the improved technique are lightweight only containing logic and hardware needed to convert facts from the fact sources to the common format for storage in a database. Accordingly integrating a new source into the KBA system takes relatively little time.

One embodiment of the improved technique is directed to a method of providing a set of questions in a KBA system. The method includes receiving facts from multiple fact sources each fact source being associated with a distinct data format. The method also includes providing a set of adaptors each adaptor being constructed and arranged to convert facts in a distinct data format with which a fact source is associated to a common data format. The method further includes generating the set of questions from the facts in the common data format the set of questions being configured to elicit from a user a corresponding set of responses from which a KBA result is produced.

Additionally some embodiments of the improved technique are directed to a system configured to provide a set of questions in a KBA system. The system includes a set of adaptors and a database server. Each adaptor of the set of adaptors includes a network interface memory and a controller the controller being configured to receive facts from multiple fact sources each fact source being associated with a distinct data format and convert the facts in a distinct data format with which a fact source is associated to a common data format. The database server includes a network interface memory and a controller the controller being configured to generate the set of questions from the facts in the common data format the set of questions being configured to elicit from a user a corresponding set of responses from which a KBA result is produced.

Furthermore some embodiments of the improved technique are directed to a computer program product having a non transitory computer readable storage medium which stores code including a set of instructions to carry the method of providing a set of questions in a KBA system.

Communication medium provides network connections between KBA system and fact sources . Communications medium may implement a variety of protocols such as TCP IP UDP ATM Ethernet Fibre Channel combinations thereof and the like. Furthermore communications media may include various components e.g. cables switches routers gateways bridges NAS SAN appliances nodes interfaces etc. . Moreover the communications medium are capable of having a variety of topologies e.g. queue manager and spoke ring backbone multi drop point to point irregular combinations thereof and so on .

Fact sources include various databases . . . in communication with KBA system . For example suppose that fact source is a Microsoft Exchange server fact source is an IBM Lotus Domino server and fact source is an SAP server. In some arrangements some or all of fact sources are remote from KBA server in other arrangements some or all of fact sources are in the same location as KBA server .

Application server is an electronic system in communication with database server and external systems such as enterprise app server that provide an application programming interface API for providing questions to user . Application server may also be in communication with a NetView terminal at which a service representative provides questions to user .

Database server is an electronic system in communication with the set of adaptors and application server . Database server includes storage device on which database is stored.

Database is a database which stores facts in a common format. Database includes entries each of which represents a fact. The common format is represented by various fields within each entry. In some arrangements database is a relational database in other arrangements database is a NoSQL database.

Set of adaptors includes adaptors . . . adaptors for corresponding fact sources . . . . In some arrangements adaptors take the form of specialized hardware connected to database server . In other arrangements adaptors take the form of software configured to run on database server . In still other arrangements adaptors take the form of hardware or software connected to corresponding fact sources .

In the examples provided below fact source is a Microsoft Exchange server fact source is an IBM Lotus Domino server and fact source is a SAP server. In these cases facts are contained in emails facts are contained in calendar entries and facts are contained in expense reports. The facts and each possess formatting defined by their respective fact source. For example facts are formatted according to the email formatting e.g. MIME plain type HTML etc. facts are formatted according to conventions used by Lotus Notes for storing calendar data and facts are formatted according to how SAP treats expense report data.

During operation fact sources send facts to adaptors provided by KBA system . In some arrangements fact sources send facts to KBA system on a regular basis as part of a subscription. In other arrangements fact sources send facts to KBA system in response to a request sent by KBA server .

Each adaptor receives facts from a corresponding fact source and upon receipt of the facts converts the received facts from fact sources in their respective formats into a common format. The common format is configured to allow KBA system to store all facts together in database independent of the fact source from where the facts originated. Further details of the common format will be described below with respect to .

In performing a conversion operation each adaptor scans for data such as keywords quantities and identifiers within the individual format. Such key data represents values to be stored in an individual entry of database representing a fact . In some arrangements the conversion operation runs on a continuous basis in other arrangements the conversion operation runs off line e.g. during certain hours of the night when the servers are off line .

In response to a request to authorize a user received at application server from either service representative or enterprise app server database server proceeds to build questions using the facts stored in database . Database server performs a lookup operation on database to find entries having a user identifier corresponding to user . From such entries database server constructs questions using the various fields in the entries which are defined by the common format.

Further details about the conversion and question building processes are discussed below with respect to and .

Network interface takes the form of an Ethernet card in some arrangements network interface takes other forms including a wireless receiver and a token ring card.

Memory is configured to store code which includes conversion code configured to convert facts see in a distinct data format with which a fact source is associated to the common data format. Memory also includes space for intermediate data in which intermediate results of the conversion process are stored. Memory generally takes the form of e.g. random access memory flash memory or a non volatile memory.

Processor takes the form of but is not limited to Intel or AMD based MPUs and can include a single or multi cores each running single or multiple threads. Processor is coupled to memory and is configured to execute instructions from conversion code . Processor includes conversion engine

During operation network interface receives facts and places data representing facts in space for intermediate data . Upon the space for intermediate data being filled conversion engine performs a conversion operation on the data representing facts . Analogous events occur with respect to facts and and conversion engines and . Details of the conversion process are described below with respect to .

Along these lines email is to a user having a user identifier User A from a user having a user identifier User B cc ed to a user having user identifier User C having a subject Dinner Meeting received on Mar. 8 2012. The body of email details a meeting taking place at Restaurant R at 8 PM because no other keywords e.g. tomorrow Friday etc. are present in the body of email the meeting is presumably a dinner meeting at 8 PM on Mar. 8 2012.

Also calendar entry belonging to the user having user identifier User C includes data representing an event including a dinner with the user having user identifier User C at Restaurant S at 8 PM on Mar. 8 2012.

Further expense report belonging to the user having user identifier User B indicates that a meal was had on Mar. 8 2012 with users having user identifiers User A and User C at Restaurant R. In addition a user having identifier Potential Client D was present at the meal. The meal cost 95.12.

Conversion engines and each extracts key information from each of the respective facts and and places this information in various fields within corresponding entries within database . How each conversion engine places information in database depends on the formatting of the corresponding facts . For example conversion engine extracts the values of the fields in the To From cc Time and Subject lines of email . In addition conversion engine searches the body of email for various keywords e.g. Restaurant R. Conversion engine on the other hand extracts the owner User B date March 8 and time 8 PM of the entry as well keywords from the description of the event in the entry e.g. B implying User B and Restaurant S. Conversion engine extracts the owner User C the event type Meal a location Restaurant B and an amount 95.12 as well as keywords in a description of the expense event e.g. Meal User A User C and Potential Client D. 

Conversion engines and places the respective extracted data into database entries and . Each database entry and has various fields corresponding to the extracted data a fact identifier fact type extracted user identifiers extracted location identifiers extracted keywords money amounts and times . The data in database represents the facts in a common format such data is ready to be processed for question building. Details of question building based on data in database are described below with respect to .

Results of a sample question building operation are summarized in the set of questions stored as intermediate data in memory see . There are six questions Q1 . . . Q6 shown in the set of questions these questions are WH questions i.e. who what when and where . The types of questions are reflective of the sources of the facts . For example when questions e.g. Q6 originate from calendar entry

In some arrangements however facts from each collected entry are cross checked against the others for consistency. Along these lines consider the where question Q2 in set of questions . Database entries and show that the meeting took place at Restaurant R while entry has the meeting taking place at Restaurant S. In this case question engine includes logic e.g. a rules table to decide at which location the meeting took place. For example because the majority of the database entries state that the location was Restaurant R Restaurant R is taken to be the correct location.

In some further arrangements set of questions are ranked according to ranking logic provided as part of a risk engine within an adaptive authentication system. Along these lines User B has a user profile from which risk engine generates a likelihood in the form of risk scores of user being User B given a correct response to questions in set of questions . The ranking of the questions in set of questions then ensures that questions presented to user have the lowest likelihoods of false positives or false negatives. Questions having a risk score above a threshold risk score may be discarded. In some arrangements questions having a sufficiently high risk score may be used for training purposes for risk engine .

In some further arrangements question engine may exclude facts involving user identifiers from users outside of an organization. For example Potential Client D from fact would not be a part of a company employing User A User B and User C. In this case Potential Client D posing as User B could gain access to data to which Potential Client D is not authorized to access by answering questions about the meeting in which he participated. In such a case only question Q1 of set of questions would be presented to user .

In some arrangements in step the facts are stored in a database when the facts have been converted to the common data format the database including a set of entries each entry of the set of entries being associated with a fact and including at least one identifier associated with a customer.
