Gaming machines which provide players awards in primary or base games are well known. Gaming machines generally require the player to place or make a wager to activate the primary or base game. In many of these gaming machines the award is based on the player obtaining a winning symbol or symbol combination and on the amount of the wager e.g. the higher the wager the higher the award . Generally symbols or symbol combinations which are less likely to occur usually provide higher awards. In such known gaming machines the amount of the wager made on the base game by the player may vary.

Secondary or bonus games are also known in gaming machines. The secondary or bonus games usually provide an additional award to the player. Secondary or bonus games usually do not require an additional wager by the player to be activated. Secondary or bonus games are generally activated or triggered upon an occurrence of a designated triggering symbol or triggering symbol combination in the primary or base game. For instance a bonus symbol occurring on the payline on the third reel of a three reel slot machine may trigger the secondary bonus game. When a secondary or bonus game is triggered the gaming machines generally indicates this to the player through one or more visual and or audio output devices such as the reels lights speakers video screens etc. Part of the enjoyment and excitement of playing certain gaming machines is the occurrence or triggering of the secondary or bonus game even before the player knows how much the bonus award will be .

Certain known secondary or bonus games include a group gaming aspect wherein a plurality of players participate in a group event for one or more bonus awards such as progressive awards. Certain known gaming machines are configured such that the players of these gaming machines compete for one or more awards. Other known gaming machines are configured such that the players share with each other or can each win one or more awards. These awards are sometimes displayed by one or more secondary display devices above the bank or group of gaming machines.

These types of group or community gaming systems where the players are competing for awards where the players are sharing awards or where the players are winning awards at the same time continue to grow in popularity. Certain of these group or community gaming systems create an aura of excitement and entertainment for the people playing the gaming machines and for people watching play. There is a continuing need to provide new and different gaming machines and gaming systems which excite and entertain players.

The present disclosure relates generally to gaming systems and methods for providing a group event eligibility sequence and a group event.

In various embodiments the gaming system disclosed herein includes one or more group event eligibility sequences. Each group event eligibility sequence is associated with a set duration. In these embodiments if one or more players at one or more gaming machines collectively satisfy a group event eligibility threshold within the set duration of an initiated or triggered group event eligibility sequence the gaming system determines that such players are eligible to participate in a group event. For the group event the gaming system provides one or more group event awards to such participating players.

In certain embodiments the gaming system disclosed herein enables one or more players to play one or more primary games. In association with the plays of the primary games the gaming system causes zero one or more of the players to accumulate zero one or more of a plurality of different group event eligibility units such as different game elements generated in such primary games. Each group event eligibility unit is associated with a set duration such as an amount of time or a quantity of games played before that group event eligibility unit expires.

In these embodiments upon the accumulation of one of a plurality of different group event eligibility units the gaming system begins to run lapse or incrementally modify the set duration associated with that accumulated group event eligibility unit. That is upon a group event eligibility unit accumulation event the gaming system initiates a group event eligibility sequence for the duration associated with the group event eligibility unit accumulation event which occurred. For example if the gaming system randomly generates a first designated symbol i.e. a first group event eligibility unit in a play of a game the gaming system accumulates that first designated symbol and begins counting down a timer from a set duration of five minutes associated with the generated first designated symbol.

In one embodiment in addition to initiating a group event eligibility sequence in association with the accumulated group event eligibility unit the gaming system provides the player associated with the accumulation of the group event eligibility unit an award associated with the accumulated group event eligibility unit. For example each individual group event eligibility unit is associated with a different progressive award wherein upon each individual group event eligibility unit being accumulated the gaming system provides the associated progressive award to a player and resets the provided progressive award to a base or reset amount.

Following the initiation of the group event eligibility sequence and in conjunction with the running of the duration associated with the accumulated group event eligibility unit the gaming system continues enabling one or more players to accumulate zero one or more of the different group event eligibility units. In such embodiments as the duration associated with one or more accumulated group event eligibility units approach expiration certain players experience a greater feeling of excitement and anticipation as these players frantically attempt to satisfy the group event eligibility threshold.

If the players fail to collectively accumulate a designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units within the set duration associated with one of the accumulated group event eligibility units the gaming system removes or otherwise eliminates that accumulated group event eligibility unit. In other words if a group event eligibility threshold i.e. one or more players collectively accumulating the designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units is not reached or satisfied within the set duration of an individual group event eligibility sequence the gaming system discards the accumulated group event eligibility unit which triggered the initiation of that individual group event eligibility sequence. Put differently upon the occurrence of a group event eligibility unit expiration event associated with a previously accumulated group event eligibility unit the gaming system eliminates that previously accumulated the group event eligibility unit. Continuing with the above example if the group event eligibility threshold includes collectively accumulating five different symbols and the players fail to collectively accumulate the five different symbols during the five minute duration associated with the accumulated first symbol the gaming system removes or eliminates the accumulated first symbol from the set of accumulated symbols. It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments the removal or elimination of one group event eligibility unit upon the conclusion of the duration associated with that accumulated group event eligibility unit does not affect any other currently accumulated group event eligibility units nor any running durations associated with such other currently accumulated group event eligibility units.

On the other hand if one or more players concurrently accumulate the designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units within the set duration associated with each of the currently accumulated group event eligibility units the gaming system enables the players having currently accumulated group event eligibility units to participate in a group event. The gaming system then provides a group event award to such players. That is if the group event eligibility threshold is reached prior to the durations of each of the currently accumulated group event eligibility units lapsing and thus prior to such group event eligibility units being eliminated the gaming system triggers a group bonus event for the players which accumulated such non eliminated gaming elements. Such embodiments create an aura of excitement and entertainment for certain players because such players cooperate to accumulate group event eligibility units and benefit from the collective accumulation of such group event eligibility units within a set duration. Continuing alternatively with the above example if the group event eligibility threshold includes collectively accumulating five game symbols and three players concurrently accumulate the five different symbols during the five minute duration associated with the accumulated first symbol and the durations associated with the four other accumulated symbols have not lapsed the gaming system causes these three players to each participate in a group event and further provides a group event award to each of these three participating players.

It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments upon each accumulation of each group event eligibility unit occurring before after or during the running of the set duration associated with a previously accumulated group event eligibility unit the gaming system begins to run or lapse the set duration associated with that accumulated group event eligibility unit i.e. the gaming system initiates another group event eligibility sequence . Accordingly if a plurality of group event eligibility units are accumulated at different points in time different durations associated with different accumulated group event eligibility units are concurrently running and thus different group event eligibility sequences are concurrently occurring . Thus even if one duration associated with one accumulated group event eligibility unit expires and thus that accumulated group event eligibility unit is eliminated one or more other durations associated with one or more other accumulated group event eligibility units may be pending with a partially satisfied group event eligibility threshold. Such a configuration of having multiple concurrently running group event eligibility sequences combats any group event eligibility fatigue which may occur upon the conclusion of a failed group event eligibility sequence while players await for another group event eligibility sequence to be initiated.

Additional features and advantages are described in and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.

In various embodiments the gaming system disclosed herein includes one or more group event eligibility sequences. Each group event eligibility sequence is associated with a set duration such as an amount of time or a quantity of games played. In these embodiments if one or more players at one or more gaming machines collectively satisfy a group event eligibility threshold within the set duration of an initiated or triggered group event eligibility sequence the gaming system determines that such players are eligible to participate in a group event. For the group event the gaming system provides one or more group event awards to such participating players.

While certain of the embodiments described below are directed to triggering a group event eligibility sequence and any associated group event as a secondary or bonus game it should be appreciated that the present disclosure may additionally or alternatively be employed in association with determining which player s participate in one or more plays of a primary or base wagering group event. Moreover while the player s credit balance the player s wager and any awards are displayed as an amount of monetary credits or currency in the embodiments described below one or more of such player s credit balance such player s wager and any awards provided to such player may be for non monetary credits promotional credits and or player tracking points or credits.

The present disclosure contemplates a variety of different gaming systems each having one or more of a plurality of different features attributes or characteristics. It should be appreciated that a gaming system as used herein refers to various configurations of a one or more central servers central controllers or remote hosts b one or more electronic gaming machines EGMs and or c one or more personal gaming devices such as desktop computers laptop computers tablet computers or computing devices personal digital assistants PDAs mobile telephones such as smart phones and other mobile computing devices.

Thus in various embodiments the gaming system of the present disclosure includes a one or more EGMs in combination with one or more central servers central controllers or remote hosts b one or more personal gaming devices in combination with one or more central servers central controllers or remote hosts c one or more personal gaming devices in combination with one or more EGMs d one or more personal gaming devices one or more EGMs and one or more central servers central controllers or remote hosts in combination with one another e a single EGM f a plurality of EGMs in combination with one another g a single personal gaming device h a plurality of personal gaming devices in combination with one another i a single central server central controller or remote host and or j a plurality of central servers central controllers or remote hosts in combination with one another.

For brevity and clarity each EGM and each personal gaming device of the present disclosure is collectively referred herein as an EGM. Additionally for brevity and clarity unless specifically stated otherwise EGM as used herein represents one EGM or a plurality of EGMs and central server central controller or remote host as used herein represents one central server central controller or remote host or a plurality of central servers central controllers or remote hosts.

Referring now to a flowchart of an example embodiment of a process for operating a gaming system or a gaming device disclosed herein is illustrated. In one embodiment this process is embodied in one or more software programs stored in one or more memories and executed by one or more processors or servers. Although this process is described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in it should be appreciated that many other methods of performing the acts associated with this process may be used. For example the order of certain steps described may be changed or certain steps described may be optional.

In one embodiment the gaming system enables each player at each of a plurality of EGMs to place a wager to play a primary game as indicated in block of .

For each player at each of the EGMs that places a wager the gaming system generates and displays a plurality of primary game symbols as indicated in block . The gaming system then determines and displays any primary game awards associated with the generated primary game symbols as indicated in block .

For example as seen in the gaming system i enables a first player i.e. Player A to wager on and play a primary game of a first EGM ii enables a second player i.e. Player B to wager on and play a primary game of a second EGM iii enables a third player i.e. Player C to wager on and play a primary game of a third EGM iv enables a fourth player i.e. Player D to wager on and play a primary game of a fourth EGM and v enables a fifth player i.e. Player E to wager on and play a primary game of a fifth EGM . In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as TRY AND ACCUMULATE GROUP EVENT TOKENS TO WIN AWARDS to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays such as community display device .

In different embodiments one or more of the primary games which generated one or more primary game symbols played by one or more of the EGMs include but are not limited to a play of any suitable slot game a play of any suitable free spins or free activations game a play of any suitable wheel game a play of any suitable card game a play of any suitable offer and acceptance game a play of any suitable award ladder game a play of any suitable puzzle type game a play of any suitable persistence game a play of any suitable selection game a play of any suitable cascading symbols game a play of any suitable ways to win game a play of any suitable scatter pay game a play of any suitable coin pusher game a play of any suitable elimination game a play of any suitable stacked wilds game a play of any suitable trail game a play of any suitable bingo game a play of any suitable video scratch off game a play of any suitable pick until complete game a play of any suitable shooting simulation game a play of any suitable racing game a play of any suitable promotional game a play of any suitable high low game a play of any suitable lottery game a play of any suitable number selection game a play of any suitable dice game a play of any suitable skill game a play of any suitable auction game a play of any suitable reverse auction game or a play of any other suitable type of game.

In addition to determining any primary game awards associated with the generated primary game symbols for each wagered on primary game the gaming system determines if any group event eligibility unit accumulation events occur as indicated in diamond of . In one embodiment a group event eligibility unit accumulation event occurs based on a displayed event associated with a play of a game. In one such embodiment a group event eligibility unit includes a game element of a play of a game such as a designated primary game symbol or a designated primary game symbol combination . In this embodiment the gaming system determines if a group event eligibility unit accumulation event occurs by determining if the designated primary game symbol or the designated primary game symbol combination was generated in association with the play of the primary game.

If the gaming system determines that no group event eligibility unit accumulation event occurred in association with any of the wagered on plays of the primary games the gaming system returns to block and proceeds as described above with enabling the placement of additional wagers on addition plays of the primary games.

On the other hand if the gaming system determines that at least one group event eligibility unit accumulation event occurred as indicated in block the gaming system accumulates a group event eligibility unit associated with the group event eligibility unit accumulation event which occurred. As further indicated in block the accumulated group event eligibility unit is associated with a set duration before that group event eligibility unit expires or lapses. In one such embodiment the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes an amount of time before that group event eligibility unit expires or lapses. In another such embodiment the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes a quantity of games played before that group event eligibility unit expires or lapses. In another such embodiment the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes a quantity of occurrence of any traceable event which occurs either in association with one or more games played or independent of one or more games played before that group event eligibility unit expires or lapses.

For example as seen in in association with the third EGM generating the single bar single bar single bar symbol combination the gaming system accumulates the single bar symbol group event eligibility unit which is illustrated as the single bar symbol group event token . As further seen in the accumulated single bar symbol group event token is associated with a duration of two minutes which as described below the gaming system begins counting down from . In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as PLAYER C ACCUMULATED THE SINGLE BAR GROUP EVENT TOKEN and THE GROUP NOW HAS TWO MINUTES TO ACCUMULATE THE REST OF THE GROUP EVENT TOKENS BEFORE THIS ACCUMULATED SINGLE BAR GROUP EVENT TOKEN EXPIRES to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays such as community display device .

In one embodiment in addition to being associated with a set duration one or more group event eligibility units are associated with a group event eligibility unit award such as a progressive award. In this embodiment if the gaming system accumulates a group event eligibility unit in association with a player the gaming system also provides the player the group event eligibility unit award associated with the accumulated group event eligibility unit. For example as seen in each of the three available group event eligibility units is associated with a separate progressive award. In this example i the single bar symbol group event eligibility unit is associated with a first progressive award currently valued at 75.89 ii the double bar symbol group event eligibility unit is associated with a second progressive award currently valued at 95.45 and iii the triple bar symbol group event eligibility unit is associated with a third progressive award currently valued at 85.23. As seen in in association with the third EGM causing an accumulation of the single bar symbol group event eligibility unit as a result of generating the single bar single bar single bar symbol combination the gaming system provides the first progressive award of 75.89 to the third player of the third EGM . As further seen in the gaming system resets this first progressive award to a reset or base amount of 25 00. In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as YOU WON THE SINGLE BAR PROGRESSIVE AWARD OF 75.89 and NICE WIN to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays.

In association with the accumulation of a group event eligibility unit the gaming system further sets a counter meter or timer at a predefined duration associated with the accumulated group event eligibility unit as indicated in block . The gaming system then modifies the set counter at designated intervals as indicated in block . In other words upon the accumulation of a group event eligibility unit the gaming system begins to run lapse or incrementally modify the set duration associated with that accumulated group event eligibility unit. Put differently upon a group event eligibility unit accumulation event the gaming system initiates a group event eligibility sequence for the duration associated with the group event eligibility unit accumulation event which occurred. In one such embodiment wherein the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes an amount of time the gaming system modifies the set counter at designated time intervals. In another such embodiment wherein the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes a quantity of games played the gaming system modifies the set counter at designated intervals based on one or more games played. In another such embodiment wherein the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes a quantity of occurrence of any traceable event the gaming system modifies the set counter at designated intervals based on such occurrences of these traceable events.

Following the setting of the counter for the accumulated group event eligibility unit and the periodic modification to the set counter at designated intervals the gaming system determines if the set counter meter or timer for any accumulated group eligibility units has lapsed or expired as indicated in diamond . In one such embodiment wherein the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes an amount of time the gaming system determines whether the amount of time has expired or lapsed. In another such embodiment wherein the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes a quantity of games played the gaming system determines if the quantity of games have been played. In another such embodiment wherein the set duration associated with an accumulated group event eligibility unit includes a quantity of occurrence of any traceable event the gaming system determines whether the quantity of such traceable events have occurred.

If the set counter for any of the accumulated group eligibility units has lapsed the gaming system eliminates discards or otherwise deems not currently accumulated that group eligibility unit as indicated in block . That is if the players fail to collectively accumulate a designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units within the set duration associated with one of the accumulated group event eligibility units the gaming system removes or otherwise eliminates that accumulated group event eligibility unit. In other words if a group event eligibility threshold i.e. one or more players collectively accumulating the designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units is not reached or satisfied within the set duration of an individual group event eligibility sequence the gaming system discards the accumulated group event eligibility unit which triggered the initiation of that individual group event eligibility sequence. It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments the removal or elimination of one group event eligibility unit upon the conclusion of the duration associated with that accumulated group event eligibility unit does not affect any other currently accumulated group event eligibility units nor any running durations associated with such other currently accumulated group event eligibility units. It should be further appreciated that as one or more counters approach expiring certain players experience a greater feeling of excitement and anticipation as these players frantically attempt to satisfy the group event eligibility threshold.

On the other hand if the set counter has not lapsed the gaming system returns to block and proceeds as described above. That is if the gaming system determines that the set counter meter or timer for an individually accumulated group eligibility unit has any remaining duration to enable the players of the EGMs to reach or satisfy a group event eligibility threshold the gaming system continues monitoring the duration of such accumulated group event eligibility units for any expiration.

Following the accumulation of a group event eligibility unit and concurrent with the periodic group event eligibility unit counter modifications and potential elimination of any previously accumulated group event eligibility units the gaming system determines if a designated quantity of different group event eligibility units are currently accumulated as indicated in diamond of . Put differently the gaming system determines if a group event eligibility threshold i.e. one or more players collectively accumulating the designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units is reached or satisfied within the set duration of an individual group event eligibility sequence.

If the gaming system determines that the designated quantity of different group eligibility units are not currently accumulated the gaming system returns to block and proceeds as described above with enabling the placement of additional wagers on addition plays of the primary games.

For example as seen in during the duration of the two minutes associated with the accumulated single bar symbol group eligibility unit in association with the fifth EGM generating the triple bar triple bar triple bar symbol combination the gaming system accumulates the triple bar symbol group event eligibility unit which is illustrated as the triple bar symbol group event token . As further seen in the accumulated triple bar symbol group event token is also associated with a duration of two minutes which the gaming system begins counting down from. In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as PLAYER E ACCUMULATED THE TRIPLE BAR GROUP EVENT TOKEN. THE GROUP NOW HAS ONE MINUTE AND EIGHT SECONDS REMAINING BEFORE THE ACCUMULATED SINGLE BAR GROUP EVENT TOKEN EXPIRES TO ACCUMULATE THE REST OF THE GROUP EVENT TOKENS to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays such as community display device .

As seen in in association with the fifth EGM causing the accumulation of the triple bar symbol group event eligibility unit the gaming system provides the third progressive award currently valued at 88.27 to the fifth player of the fifth EGM . Accordingly the gaming system resets this third progressive award to a reset or base amount of 25.00. In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as YOU WON THE SINGLE BAR PROGRESSIVE AWARD OF 88.27 and NICE WIN to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays.

In certain embodiments upon each accumulation of each group event eligibility unit occurring before after or during the running of the set duration associated with a previously accumulated group event eligibility unit the gaming system begins to run or lapse the set duration associated with that accumulated group event eligibility unit i.e. the gaming system initiates another group event eligibility sequence . Accordingly if a plurality of group event eligibility units are accumulated at different points in time different durations associated with different accumulated group event eligibility units are concurrently running and thus different group event eligibility sequences are concurrently occurring . For example as seen in because the double bar symbol group event eligibility unit was accumulated with one minute and eight seconds remaining on the set counter for the accumulated single bar symbol group event eligibility unit the group event eligibility sequences associated with these two accumulated group event eligibility units will overlap by one minute and eight seconds. Thus even if one duration associated with one accumulated group event eligibility unit expires and thus that accumulated group event eligibility unit is eliminated one or more other durations associated with one or more other accumulated group event eligibility units may be pending with a partially satisfied group event eligibility threshold.

Returning to if the gaming system determines that the designated quantity of different group eligibility units are currently accumulated the gaming system enables each player at each EGM associated with a currently accumulated group eligibility unit to participate in a group event as indicated in block . The gaming system then provides each participating player with a group event award as indicated in block . In this embodiment if the players concurrently accumulate the designated quantity of the different group event eligibility units within the set duration associated with each of the currently accumulated group event eligibility units the gaming system enables the players having currently accumulated group event eligibility units to participate in a group event and provides a group event award to such players. That is if the group event eligibility threshold is reached prior to the durations of each of the currently accumulated group event eligibility units lapsing and thus prior to such group event eligibility units being eliminated the gaming system triggers a group bonus event for the players which accumulated such non eliminated gaming elements.

In one embodiment the triggered group event is a cooperative group event wherein the participating players work in conjunction with one another such as by playing together as a team or group to win one or more group event awards. In one such embodiment any group event award won by the group is shared either equally or based on any suitable criteria amongst the different players of the group. In another embodiment the triggered group event is a competitive group event wherein the participating players compete against one another for one or more group event awards.

In different embodiments the play of the group event includes but is not limited to a play of any suitable slot group event a play of any suitable free spins or free activations group event a play of any suitable wheel group event a play of any suitable card group event a play of any suitable offer and acceptance group event a play of any suitable award ladder group event a play of any suitable puzzle type group event a play of any suitable persistence group event a play of any suitable selection group event a play of any suitable cascading symbols group event a play of any suitable ways to win group event a play of any suitable scatter pay group event a play of any suitable coin pusher group event a play of any suitable elimination group event a play of any suitable stacked wilds group event a play of any suitable trail group event a play of any suitable bingo group event a play of any suitable video scratch off group event a play of any suitable pick until complete group event a play of any suitable shooting simulation group event a play of any suitable racing group event a play of any suitable promotional group event a play of any suitable high low group event a play of any suitable lottery group event a play of any suitable number selection group event a play of any suitable dice group event a play of any suitable skill group event a play of any suitable auction group event a play of any suitable reverse auction group event a play of any suitable group game or a play of any other suitable type of group event.

In different embodiments the primary game awards group event eligibility unit awards and or group event awards include one or more of a quantity of monetary credits a quantity of non monetary credits a quantity of promotional credits a quantity of player tracking points a progressive award a modifier such as a multiplier a quantity of free plays of one or more games a quantity of plays of one or more secondary or bonus games a multiplier of a quantity of free plays of a game one or more lottery based awards such as lottery or drawing tickets a wager match for one or more plays of one or more games an increase in the average expected payback percentage for one or more plays of one or more games one or more comps such as a free dinner a free night s stay at a hotel a high value product such as a free car or a low value product such as a free teddy bear one or more bonus credits usable for online play a lump sum of player tracking points or credits a multiplier for player tracking points or credits an increase in a membership or player tracking level one or more coupons or promotions usable within and or outside of the gaming establishment e.g. a 20 off coupon for use at a convenience store virtual goods associated with the gaming system virtual goods not associated with the gaming system an access code usable to unlock content on the internet.

Continuing with the illustrated example as seen in during the duration of the two minutes associated with the accumulated single bar symbol group eligibility unit in association with the first EGM generating the double bar double bar double bar symbol combination the gaming system accumulates the double bar symbol group event eligibility unit which is illustrated as the double bar symbol group event token . Accordingly the gaming system determines that the single bar symbol group event token the double bar symbol group event token and the triple bar symbol group event token are each currently accumulated. Based on this determination the gaming system will trigger a group event for the first player of the first EGM associated with the accumulation of the double bar symbol group event token the third player of the third EGM associated with the accumulation of the single bar symbol group event token and the fifth player of the fifth EGM associated with the accumulation of the triple bar symbol group event token . In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as PLAYER A ACCUMULATED THE DOUBLE BAR GROUP EVENT TOKEN JUST IN TIME and PLAYER A PLAYER C AND PLAYER E WILL EACH PROCEED TO THE GROUP EVENT to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays such as community display device .

As also seen in in association with the first EGM causing the accumulation of the double bar symbol group event eligibility unit the gaming system provides the second progressive award currently valued at 99.96 to the first player of the first EGM . Accordingly the gaming system resets this second progressive award to a reset or base amount of 25.00. In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as YOU WON THE DOUBLE BAR PROGRESSIVE AWARD OF 99.96 and NICE WIN to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays.

As seen in for the triggered group event the gaming system provides part of a group event progressive award currently valued at 10 364.31 as seen in to the first player of the first EGM associated with the accumulation of the double bar symbol group event token the third player of the third EGM associated with the accumulation of the single bar symbol group event token and the fifth player of the fifth EGM associated with the accumulation of the triple bar symbol group event token . Following providing this group event progressive award to such players the gaming system resets this group event progressive award to a reset or base amount of 2 000.00. In this example the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as PLAYER A PLAYER C AND PLAYER E EACH WIN A 3 454 77 PORTION OF THE GROUP EVENT PROGRESSIVE AWARD OF 10 364.31 and GREAT WIN to one or more players visually or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays such as community display device .

In one embodiment as seen in the group event award is shared or split equally amongst each of the players associated with each of the accumulated group event eligibility units. In another embodiment the group event award is shared or split unequally amongst each of the players associated with each of the accumulated group event eligibility units. In one such embodiment different group event eligibility units have different probabilities of being accumulated and the gaming system provides the player associated with the accumulation of a group event eligibility unit with a lower probability of being accumulated with a greater portion of the group event award compared to the portion of the group event award provided to the player associated with the accumulation of a group event eligibility unit with a higher probability of being accumulated .

In one embodiment as described above the accumulation of one group event eligibility unit while the duration associated with another accumulated group event eligibility unit is pending does not affect any running durations associated with such other currently accumulated group event eligibility units. In another embodiment the accumulation of one group event eligibility unit while the duration associated with another accumulated group event eligibility unit is pending affects the running durations associated with such other currently accumulated group event eligibility units such as by resetting such durations.

In one embodiment as described above each of the designated quantity of group event eligibility units must be concurrently accumulated i.e. the durations of such group event eligibility units must each overlap at at least one point in time to trigger the group event. In another embodiment less than all of the designated quantity of group event eligibility units must be concurrently accumulated to trigger the group event. In one such embodiment different quantities of concurrently accumulated group event eligibility units are associated with different available group event awards. For example if a first quantity of group event eligibility units are concurrently accumulated the gaming system triggers a group event associated with a first group event award and if a second greater quantity of group event eligibility units are concurrently accumulated the gaming system triggers a group event associated with a second greater group event award.

In one embodiment if one or more players concurrently accumulate a plurality of the same group event eligibility unit the gaming system enables such player s to share any bonus event awards associated with that group event eligibility unit. In one such embodiment if one or more players concurrently accumulate a plurality of the same group event eligibility unit the gaming system enables does not affect any running durations associated with this accumulated group event eligibility unit. In another such embodiment if one or more players concurrently accumulate a plurality of the same group event eligibility unit the gaming system affects the running durations associated with this accumulated group event eligibility unit such as by resetting the duration associated with this accumulated group event eligibility unit.

In one embodiment the gaming system causes at least one display device of the players EGM to display the group event eligibility sequence and or group event. In another embodiment in addition or in alternative to each EGM displaying the group event eligibility sequence and or group event the gaming system causes one or more community or overhead display devices to display part or all of the group event eligibility sequence and or group event to one or more other players or bystanders either at a gaming establishment or viewing over a network such as the internet. In another embodiment in addition or in alternative to each EGM displaying the group event eligibility sequence and or group event the gaming system causes one or more internet sites to each display the group event eligibility sequence and or group event such that a player is enabled to log on from a personal web browser. In another such embodiment the gaming system enables the player to play one or more primary games on one device while viewing the group event eligibility sequence and or group event from another device. For example the gaming system enables the player to play one or more primary games on a mobile phone while viewing the status of the group event eligibility sequence and or group event on a desktop or laptop computer.

In one embodiment upon an accumulation of one of the plurality of different group event eligibility units i.e. an initiation of a group event eligibility sequence the gaming system enables one or more players currently participating in the initiated group event eligibility sequence to invite one or more other players to participate in the initiated group event eligibility sequence. That is as one or more group event eligibility sequences each include one or more persistence aspects i.e. based on the duration one or more of such group event eligibility sequences span across multiple plays of multiple games this embodiment enables one or more players to invite other players to participate in a partially completed persistence game.

In certain embodiments in which the primary game is a slot or spinning reel type game the gaming system includes one or more reels in either an electromechanical form with mechanical rotating reels or in a video form with simulated reels and movement thereof. Each reel displays a plurality of indicia or symbols such as bells hearts fruits numbers letters bars or other images that typically correspond to a theme associated with the gaming system. In certain such embodiments the gaming system includes one or more paylines associated with the reels. The example EGMs shown in each include a payline and a plurality of reels . In certain embodiments one or more of the reels are independent reels or unisymbol reels. In such embodiments each independent reel generates and displays one symbol.

In various embodiments one or more of the paylines is horizontal vertical circular diagonal angled or any suitable combination thereof. In other embodiments each of one or more of the paylines is associated with a plurality of adjacent symbol display positions on a requisite number of adjacent reels. In one such embodiment one or more paylines are formed between at least two symbol display positions that are adjacent to each other by either sharing a common side or sharing a common corner i.e. such paylines are connected paylines . The gaming system enables a wager to be placed on one or more of such paylines to activate such paylines. In other embodiments in which one or more paylines are formed between at least two adjacent symbol display positions the gaming system enables a wager to be placed on a plurality of symbol display positions which activates those symbol display positions.

In various embodiments the gaming system provides one or more awards after a spin of the reels when specified types and or configurations of the indicia or symbols on the reels occur on an active payline or otherwise occur in a winning pattern occur on the requisite number of adjacent reels and or occur in a scatter pay arrangement.

In certain embodiments the gaming system employs a ways to win award determination. In these embodiments any outcome to be provided is determined based on a number of associated symbols that are generated in active symbol display positions on the requisite number of adjacent reels i.e. not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations . If a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination is provided. At least U.S. Pat. No. 8 012 011 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008 0108408 and 2008 0132320 describe various examples of ways to win award determinations.

In various embodiments the gaming system includes a progressive award. Typically a progressive award includes an initial amount and an additional amount funded through a portion of each wager placed to initiate a play of a primary game. When one or more triggering events occurs the gaming system provides at least a portion of the progressive award. After the gaming system provides the progressive award an amount of the progressive award is reset to the initial amount and a portion of each subsequent wager is allocated to the next progressive award. At least U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 766 079 7 585 223 7 651 392 7 666 093 7 780 523 and 7 905 778 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008 0020846 2009 0123364 2009 0123363 and 201010227677 describe various examples of different progressive gaming systems.

As generally noted above in addition to providing winning credits or other awards for one or more plays of the primary game s in various embodiments the gaming system provides credits or other awards for one or more plays of one or more secondary games. The secondary game typically enables a prize or payout in to be obtained addition to any prize or payout obtained through play of the primary game s . The secondary game s typically produces a higher level of player excitement than the primary game s because the secondary game s provides a greater expectation of winning than the primary game s and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the primary game s . It should be appreciated that the secondary game s may be any type of suitable game either similar to or completely different from the primary game.

In various embodiments the gaming system automatically provides or initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of a triggering event or the satisfaction of a qualifying condition. In other embodiments the gaming system initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of the triggering event or the satisfaction of the qualifying condition and upon receipt of an initiation input. In certain embodiments the triggering event or qualifying condition is a selected outcome in the primary game s or a particular arrangement of one or more indicia on a display device for a play of the primary game s such as a BONUS symbol appearing on three adjacent reels along a payline following a spin of the reels for a play of the primary game. In other embodiments the triggering event or qualifying condition occurs based on a certain amount of game play such as number of games number of credits amount of time being exceeded or based on a specified number of points being earned during game play. It should be appreciated that any suitable triggering event or qualifying condition or any suitable combination of a plurality of different triggering events or qualifying conditions may be employed.

In other embodiments at least one processor of the gaming system randomly determines when to provide one or more plays of one or more secondary games. In one such embodiment no apparent reason is provided for the providing of the secondary game. In this embodiment qualifying for a secondary game is not triggered by the occurrence of an event in any primary game or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is qualification is provided without any explanation or alternatively with a simple explanation. In another such embodiment the gaming system determines qualification for a secondary game at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event such as at least partially based on play of a primary game.

In various embodiments after qualification for a secondary game has been determined the secondary game participation may be enhanced through continued play on the primary game. Thus in certain embodiments for each secondary game qualifying event such as a secondary game symbol that is obtained a given number of secondary game wagering points or credits is accumulated in a secondary game meter configured to accrue the secondary game wagering credits or entries toward eventual participation in the secondary game. In one such embodiment the occurrence of multiple such secondary game qualifying events in the primary game results in an arithmetic or exponential increase in the number of secondary game wagering credits awarded. In another such embodiment any extra secondary game wagering credits may be redeemed during the secondary game to extend play of the secondary game.

In certain embodiments no separate entry fee or buy in for the secondary game is required. That is entry into the secondary game cannot be purchased rather in these embodiments entry must be won or earned through play of the primary game thereby encouraging play of the primary game. In other embodiments qualification for the secondary game is accomplished through a simple buy in. For example qualification through other specified activities is unsuccessful payment of a fee or placement of an additional wager buys in to the secondary game. In certain embodiments a separate side wager must be placed on the secondary game or a wager of a designated amount must be placed on the primary game to enable qualification for the secondary game. In these embodiments the secondary game triggering event must occur and the side wager or designated primary game wager amount must have been placed for the secondary game to trigger.

In various embodiments in which the gaming system includes a plurality of EGMs the EGMs are configured to communicate with one another to provide a group gaming environment. In certain such embodiments the EGMs enable players of those EGMs to work in conjunction with one another such as by enabling the players to play together as a team or group to win one or more awards. In other such embodiments the EGMs enable players of those EGMs to compete against one another for one or more awards. In one such embodiment the EGMs enable the players of those EGMs to participate in one or more gaming tournaments for one or more awards. At least U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2007 0123341 200810070680 2008 0176650 and 2009 0124363 describe various examples of different group gaming systems.

In various embodiments the gaming system includes one or more player tracking systems. Such player tracking systems enable operators of the gaming system such as casinos or other gaming establishments to recognize the value of customer loyalty by identifying frequent customers and rewarding them for their patronage. Such a player tracking system is configured to track a player s gaming activity. In one such embodiment the player tracking system does so through the use of player tracking cards. In this embodiment a player is issued a player identification card that has an encoded player identification number that uniquely identifies the player. When the player s playing tracking card is inserted into a card reader of the gaming system to begin a gaming session the card reader reads the player identification number off the player tracking card to identify the player. The gaming system timely tracks any suitable information or data relating to the identified player s gaming session. The gaming system also timely tracks when the player tracking card is removed to conclude play for that gaming session. In another embodiment rather than requiring insertion of a player tracking card into the card reader the gaming system utilizes one or more portable devices such as a cell phone a radio frequency identification tag or any other suitable wireless device to track when a gaming session begins and ends. In another embodiment the gaming system utilizes any suitable biometric technology or ticket technology to track when a gaming session begins and ends.

In such embodiments during one or more gaming sessions the gaming system tracks any suitable information or data such as any amounts wagered average wager amounts and or the time at which these wagers are placed. In different embodiments for one or more players the player tracking system includes the player s account number the player s card number the player s first name the player s surname the player s preferred name the player s player tracking ranking any promotion status associated with the player s player tracking card the player s address the player s birthday the players anniversary the player s recent gaming sessions or any other suitable data. In various embodiments such tracked information and or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed on a player tracking display.
