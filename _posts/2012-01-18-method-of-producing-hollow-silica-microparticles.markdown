Patent document 9 proposes a method of using the inorganic compound particles with the average particle diameter of 50 nm or below for preventing whitening of a transparent coating film obtained by applying an embrocation for forming a transparent coating film in which A a acetylacetonato chelate compound and B inorganic compound microparticles are homogeneously dissolved or dispersed in a mixture solvent of water and an organic solvent to a base material and curing the embrocation.

As a transparent coating film containing hollow silica microparticles and an embrocation for forming the transparent coating film for instance Patent document 11 discloses an invention relating to a transparent film coated substrate formed thereon and the substrate comprises a base material and a transparent coating film provided on a surface of the substrate and the transparent coating film has i a matrix containing a silicon component in turn containing a fluorine substituted alkyl group and ii an outer shell layer and also contains inorganic compound particles which are porous or have many cavities therein. The transparent coating film is also characterized that the porosity or the cavities are preserved therein. In the transparent coating film containing hollow silica microparticles and a binder as described above however although the low refractive index of about 1.25 to about 1.45 specific to the hollow silica microparticles can be realized whitening of the coating film easily occurs and there is the need for further improving the adhesiveness to the base material and the abrasion resistance.

When a coating composition containing hollow silica microparticles and a binder is prepared and a transparent coating film is formed on a substrate using the coating composition a transparent coating film having a lower refractive index as compared to that when a composition containing ordinary silica microparticles and a binder is prepared and a transparent coating film is formed by using the composition but when hollow silica microparticles are used whitening more easily occurs in the transparent coating film which is disadvantageous and in addition there is also the need for further improving the abrasion resistance and adhesiveness.

The transparent coating film obtained by applying the compositions for forming a transparent coating film containing hollow silica microparticles and a binder according to the present invention has a low refractive index in the range from 1.25 to 1.45 and discoloring such as whitening hardly occurs in the compositions and the compositions are excellent in the abrasion resistance and the adhesiveness. Furthermore the transparent coating film is also excellent in the chemical resistance and the water resistance and for instance when water droplets dropped on a surface of the transparent coating film according to the present invention are wiped off advantageously no trace of the droplets is left.

With the production method according to the present invention the hollow silica microparticles can efficiently be produced.

Of the substrates each with a transparent coating film according to the present invention especially those having a transparent coating film in which a specific quantity of hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed in the layer state show the excellent characteristics based on the hollow silica microparticles such as the capability of suppressing reflection and the antistatic property . Furthermore in the transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention when prespecified hollow silica microparticles and prespecified metal oxide microparticles are unevenly distributed in the layered state respectively in addition to the characteristics provided by the hollow silica microparticles also the characteristics based on the metal oxide microparticles are easily and strongly shown. Especially with the compositions for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention in which prespecified hollow silica microparticles and prespecified metal oxide microparticles are contained it is possible to obtain a transparent coating film in which hollow silica microparticles and metal oxide microparticles are unevenly distributed in the layered state respectively or a substrate having the transparent coating film.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention have an outer shell with cavities formed therein and also have an average particle diameter of 5 to 300 nm and a specific surface area of 50 to 1500 m g and lose the weight by 1.0 W or more at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. when measured by the thermogravimetry TG . The hollow silica microparticles generally show a positive DTA peak when measured by the differential thermogravimetrical analysis at a temperature from 200 C. to 500 C.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are generally prepared by subjecting known hollow silica microparticles to a surface processing with a silane compound. More specifically because of a hydrolysis reaction between a silanol group on a surface of the hollow silica microparticles and the silane compound an organosilyl group monoorganosilyl diorganosilyl or triorganosilyl group directly bonds to a surface of the hollow silica microparticles and the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention have a number of organo silyl groups each directly bonding to a silicon atom on a surface thereof.

It is generally said that the organic group as described above bonds to a surface of the hollow silica microparticle with a structure like Si O SiA A an organic group through the reaction between the silane compound and the silanol group on a surface of the hollow silica microparticle.

The thermogravimetric analysis is performed to measure a change in a weight of a sample due to up and down of the atmospheric temperature around the sample and the change showing a change in a weight against that in a temperature is called TG curve. The differential thermogravimetric analysis is performed to measure a calorimetric change against a change in a temperature by detecting a difference between a temperature of a reference and that of a sample making use of a an electromotive force of a thermocouple provided in sample container and a curve showing a relation between a temperature change and a calorimetric change is referred to as DTA curve.

It is generally known that when an exothermal reaction occurs a positive peak appears on the DTA curve. Furthermore the thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis generally referred to as TG DTA is known as a method for simultaneously executing the thermogravimetry and the differential thermogravimetric analysis. In this TG DTA it is possible to simultaneously monitor a change in a weight of a sample and an endothermal or exothermal reaction when a sample is heated and therefore the technique can be applied to access compositions or thermal properties of various substances.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention show excellent effects not provided by conventional silica microparticles or hollow silica microparticles. More specifically because of the excellent effects for instance when a composition for forming a transparent coating film prepared by mixing the hollow silica microparticles according the present invention with a binder is cured on a substrate a transparent film coated substance having excellent properties can be obtained. Different from a transparent film coated substrate prepared by using the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing known silica microparticles or hollow silica microparticles with the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention it is possible to provide a transparent film coated substrate capable of suppressing whitening and having improved abrasion resistance and adhesiveness.

Namely in the transparent film coated substrate containing the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention which have the calorimetric and thermogravimetric properties as described above whitening can be suppressed and the abrasion resistance and the adhesiveness are improved. On the other hand in transparent film coated substrates containing the conventional type of hollow silica microparticles hollow silica microparticles not having been subjected to surface processing with a silane compound hollow silica microparticles not remarkable weight loss at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. or those having been subjected to surface process different from that employed in the method of producing hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention whitening occurs in the transparent coating films and the abrasion resistance and the adhesiveness are not sufficient.

In contrast in the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention the organosilyl groups present on a surface of the hollow silica microparticles directly bond to silicon atoms respectively with the structure of Si O SiR R an organic group also present on a surface of the particles in the stable state at a temperature of up to 200 C. which is guessed as a reason for suppression of aggregation of silica microparticles in the transparent coating film causing whitening in the transparent coating film because the organosilyl groups are present therein as substitutional groups tightly bonded to surfaces of the hollow silica microparticles when a transparent film coated substrate is formed. Furthermore it can be considered that presence of the organosilyl group contributes to improvement in dispersibility of silica microparticles in an organosol and a transparent coating film as well as to making more fine grained the transparent coating film because of a chemical bond with a binder resin and that the properties give excellent abrasion resistance and adhesiveness to the transparent coating film.

On the other hand in a case of the conventional hollow silica microparticles an organosilyl group is not present on a surface thereof so that the effects observed when the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are used is not provided by the conventional hollow silica microparticles. Furthermore in a case of hollow silica microparticles not subjected to surface processing by the method employed when the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are produced weight loss of 1.0 W or more due to heat can not be observed at a temperature of 200 C. or more and therefore it can be considered that a strong bond is not formed when the particles are subjected to surface processing and it may be said that the effects as provided by the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are hardly achieved also in this case like in a case of the conventional hollow silica microparticles.

In the case of the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention in addition to the thermogravimetric properties as described above a specific peak is observed at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. also in differential thermogravimetric analysis while the peak is not observed in the cases of conventional hollow silica microparticles and hollow silica microparticles not subjected to surface processing in the same way as that employed in the method of producing hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention.

It is known that a peak in the DTA curve indicates occurrence of an exothermal reaction associated with separation of an organic group. In the present invention generally a peak in the DTA curve appears at a temperature range from 200 C. to 500 C. where the thermogravimetric property described above appear.

An average particle diameter of the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention is preferably in the range from 5 to 300 nm. The hollow silica microparticles having the average particle diameter in this range are preferable for obtaining a transparent coating film. It is difficult to obtain hollow silica microparticles with the average particle diameter of less than 5 nm. When the average particle diameter is more than 300 nm scattering of light becomes remarkable and when the hollow silica microparticles are processed into a thin film the reflection is high which spoils the antireflection capability. The average diameter of the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention is more preferably in the range 10 to 200 nm and further more preferably in the range from 10 to 100 nm.

A specific surface area of the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention is preferably in the range from 50 to 1500 m g for obtaining dispersibility and stability of the hollow silica microparticles in a solvent or at the step of processing the hollow silica microparticles into a film. When the specific surface area is less than 50 m g it is difficult to obtain hollow silica microparticles having a low refractive index. On the other hand when the specific surface area is over 1500 m g the dispersibility and stability of the hollow silica microparticles become lower which is not desirable. The specific surface area of the hollow silica microparticles according the present invention is preferably in the range from 50 to 200 m g.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are required to show weight loss of 1.0 W or more in thermogravimetry at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. In a transparent film coated substrate in which the hollow silica microparticles showing weight loss due to heat of less than 1.0 W are blended therein whitening occurs and both the abrasion resistance and the adhesiveness are insufficient. A degree of the weight loss due to heat is preferably 1.05 W or more and more preferably 1.5 W or more at a temperature in the range from 200 to 500 C.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention preferably show a peak when measured by the differential thermogravimetric analysis at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. Generally when the hollow silica microparticles show the weight loss due to heat in the same temperature range at least one peak can be observed in the differential thermogravimetric analysis.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention have an organic group directly bonded to a silicon atom on a surface thereof. There is not specific restriction concerning a type of the organic group and any type of organic group is allowable on the condition that the organic group has affinity with a binder used when a composition for forming a transparent coating film is prepared especially with an organic resin does not cause whitening of a transparent coating film in a transparent film coated substrate obtained by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film on a substrate nor spoils the abrasion resistance and the adhesiveness. For instance the organic group may be a hydrocarbon group or that having an atom other than a carbon atom and a hydrogen atom. The hydrocarbon group may be either aliphatic or aromatic and also may be a saturated hydrocarbon group or an unsaturated one. The organic group may have a double bond or a triple bond and also may have an ether bond.

The atoms other than a carbon atom and a hydrogen atom include but not limited to an oxygen atom a nitrogen atom a fluorine atom a chlorine atom a bromide atom a sulfur atom a silicon atom a boron atom an aluminum atom a magnesium atom a sodium atom a lithium atom a calcium atom and a potassium atom.

A preferable example of the organic group directly bonding to a silicon atom is for instance one selected from the group consisting of saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms and halogenated hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms. More specifically the preferable organic groups include but not limited to a 3 methacryloxy propyl group a 3 acryloxy propyl group 3 3 3 trifluoropropyl group a methyl group a phenyl group an isobutyl group a vinyl group a glycidoxy tripropyl group a methacryloxy propyl group an N aminoethyl aminopropyl group an N aminoethyl aminopropyl group a aminopropyl group and an N phenyl aminopropyl group.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are generally dispersed in an organic solvent. A concentration of silica is preferable in the range from 1 to 70 W from the viewpoint of stability and more preferably in the range from 3 to 40 W .

From the view points of the adhesiveness of a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention capability to suppress whitening of a coating film and the abrasion resistance the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention preferably have the organic group expressed by general formula 1 or general formula 2 below and also preferably show weight loss of 1.5 W or more when measured by the thermogravimetry TG at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. R OC O CCH CH General formula 1 

Also for the similar reasons the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention preferably have the organic group expressed by the following general formula 3 R CFH General formula 3 

From the view points not only of the adhesiveness of a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention capability to suppress whitening of a coating film and the abrasion resistance but also of the effect to have the hollow silica microparticles unevenly distributed in the transparent coating film in the layered state as described above preferably the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention have an average particle diameter of 5 to 300 nm when measured by the dynamic light scattering method and a specific surface area of 50 to 1500 m g and also have an outer shell in which cavities are formed therein. Furthermore the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention preferably show weight loss of 1.0 W or more at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. and also show a positive DTA peak when measured by the differential thermogravimetric analysis in the same temperature range and have an organic group directly bonding to a silicon atom on a surface thereof. The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention especially preferably have the surface charge Q in the range from 5 to 20 eq g.

The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are produced by using any known hollow silica microparticles as a raw material. Generally the hollow silica microparticles have fine pores in the outer shell. In the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention the outer shell may have fine pores but the fine pores may disappear due to heating while being produced by the production method as described below.

The hollow silica microparticles used as a raw material in the present invention should have the average particle diameter of 5 to 300 nm and the specific surface area of 50 to 1500 m g.

The hollow silica microparticles which are used as a raw material in the present invention are produced by simultaneously adding an aqueous solution of a silicate and or an acidic silicic acid solution and an aqueous solution of an alkali soluble inorganic compound to an alkali aqueous solution with the pH of 10 or more or to an alkali aqueous solution with the pH of 10 or more in which seed particles are dispersed if required to prepare a dispersion liquid of core particles with the molar ratio of silica versus the inorganic compounds other than silica in the range from 0.3 to 1.0 adding a silica source to the dispersion liquid to form a first silica coating layer on the core particles and then adding an acid to the dispersion liquid to remove a portion or all of the elements constituting the core particles Refer to Patent document 6 . Furthermore an alkali aqueous solution an organic silicon compound and or a partial hydrolyte thereof are added to the dispersion liquid of the hollow silica microparticles as described above to form a second silica coating layer on the microparticles Also refer to Patent document 6 .

In the method of producing hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention at first an organosol of the hollow silica microparticles is prepared and a concentration of silica as a solid component is in the range from 1 to 70 W .

For instance a silica sol containing hollow silica microparticles prepared by using water as a dispersant is subjected to solvent substitution to obtain an organosol to be used in the present invention. Generally a ultrafilter membrane or a rotary evaporator is used to obtain an organosol with a concentration of silica as a solid component in the range from 1 to 70 W .

An organic solvent is used in solvent substitution for the silica sol containing hollow silica microparticles prepared by using water as a dispersant. There is no specific restriction over the type of organic solvent so long as the solvent does not give any negative influence to coating a surface of the hollow silica microparticles with a silane compound. Examples of the organic solvent include for instance alcohols glycols esters ketones nitrogen compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons. Generally alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are selected.

A concentration of silica as a solid component varies to solvents and when the concentration is 70 W or more the hollow silica microparticles are hardly dispersed in the solvent and the concentration of less than 1 W is not practical.

In the production method according to the present invention an organosol with a silica concentration of 1 to 70 W is prepared and a silane compound and an alkali catalyst are added to the organosol at a temperature in the range from 30 C. to 300 C. to react the silane compound to the hollow silica microparticles under the condition that a quantity of water against a quantity of added silica is in the range from 0.1 to 50 W .

A quantity of added silane compound is generally in the range from 1 to 50 weight portions against 100 weight portions of the hollow silica microparticles. When the quantity is less than 1 weight portions a percentage of the hollow silica microparticles not processed becomes too high which is not preferable. On the other hand when the percentage is over 50 weight portions a quantity of the silane compound is excessive and not economical. A quantity of added silane compound is preferably in the range from 3 to 25 weight portions.

The silane compound used in the production method according to the present invention is generally expressed with the chemical expression of RSiX R an organic group X a hydrolyzable group and n an integer of 0 to 3 . More specifically the silane compounds include but not limited to tetramethoxysilane tetraethoxysilane tetraisopropoxysilane methyl trimethoxysilane dimethyl dimethoxysilane phenyl trimethoxysilane diphenyl dimethoxysilane methyl triethoxysilane dimethyl diethoxysilane phenyl triethoxysilane diphenyl diethoxysilane isobutyl trimethoxysilane vinyl trimethoxysilane vinyl triethoxysilane vinyl tris methoxyethoxy silane 3 3 3 trifluoropropyl trimethoxysilane methyl 3 3 3 trifluoropropyl dimethoxysilane 3 4 epoxy cyclohexyl ethyl trimethoxysilane glycidoxytripropyl trimethoxysilane glycidoxypropyl methyl diethoxysilane glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane methacryloxypropyl methyl dimethoxysilane methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane methacryloxypropyl methy diethoxysilane methacryloxypropyl triethoxysilane N aminoethyl aminopropyl methyl dimethoxysilane N aminoethyl aminopropyl trimethoxysilane N aminoethyl aminopropyl triethoxysilane aminopropyl trimethoxysilane aminopropyl triethoxysilane N phenyl aminopropyl trimethoxysilane mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane trimethyl silanole methyl trichlorosilane methyl dichlorosilane dimethyl dichlorosilane trimethylchlorosilane phenyl trichlorosilane diphenyl dichlorosilane vinyl trichlorosilane trimethyl bromosilane diethylsilane and acryloxypropyl methoxysilane.

Of these substances silane having an acrylic group silane having a methacrylic group and the 3 3 3 trifluoropropyl trimethoxysilane are especially preferable.

There is no specific restriction over a quantity of added alkali catalyst and although the quantity varies according to a type of the alkali catalyst the quantity of added alkali is preferably in the range from 20 to 2 000 ppm against a quantity of the organosol in which the hollow silica microparticles are dispersed. When the quantity is less than 20 ppm sometimes the reaction of the silane compound on the surface of the hollow silica does not proceed. On the other hand when the quantity is over 2 000 ppm sometimes dispersibility of the hollow silica microparticles in a binder may drop because of the surplus alkali or other negative influences may occur due to the alkali catalyst remaining in the composition for forming a transparent coating film.

There is no specific restriction over a type of the alkali catalyst used in the present invention and such catalysts as an ammonia a hydroxide of an alkali metal or an amine compound are advantageously used. The alkali catalyst may be added as an aqueous solution thereof.

A quantity of water in a reactant solution is preferably in the range from 0.1 to 50 W more preferably 10 W or below and still further preferably 5 W or below against a quantity of added silica the hollow silica microparticles . When the quantity of water is in the range from 0.1 to 50 W a surface of the hollow silica microparticles reacts with the silane compound and the surface processing is carried out efficiently. When the quantity is less than 0.1 W the efficiency of the surface processing is low and the processing is not carried out in the stable state. When the quantity is 50 W or more the silane compounds are apt to react with themselves and as a result the surface processing of the hollow silica microparticles is not carried out sufficiently.

When a reaction between the hollow silica microparticles and the silane compound is performed at a temperature of less than 30 C. the reaction speed is low so that employment of a reaction temperature of less than 30 C. is not practical. On the other hand when the reaction temperature is over a boiling point of the organosol solvent the solvent evaporates to cause increase of the water content which is not preferable. When the reaction is carried out by using a pressure container the reaction may be carried out at a temperature of up to 300 C. Preferably the reaction temperature should be 40 C. or more but less than a boiling point of the solvent.

When a period of time for the reaction between the hollow silica microparticles and the silane compound is less than 0.1 hours sometimes the reaction does not proceed sufficiently and therefore employment of the reaction time of less than 0.1 hours is not practical. On the other hand when the reaction time is over 100 hours such parameters as the yield are not improved so that it is not necessary to make the reaction proceed for so long a time. Preferably the reaction time is set to the range from 3 hours to 30 hours.

There is no specific restriction over the sequence of adding the silane compound and the alkali catalyst to the organosol in which the hollow silica microparticles are dispersed and it is allowable 1 to add the alkali catalyst first and then add the silane compound 2 to add the silane compound first and then add the alkali catalyst or 3 to simultaneously add the silane compound and the alkali catalyst but the sequence 1 or 2 is relatively preferable.

Preferably the quantity of added silane compound is in the range from 1 to 50 weight portions against 100 weight portions of the hollow silica microparticles while the concentration of added alkali catalyst in the organosol is preferably in the range from 20 to 2 000 ppm.

The hollow silica microparticles obtained by the production method according to the present invention show weight loss of 1.0 W or more when measured by the thermogravimetry TG at a temperature in the range from 200 C. to 500 C. and also show a positive DTA peak when measured by the differential thermogravimetric analysis DTA in the same temperature range and the composition for forming a transparent film containing the hollow silica microparticles and the binder as described above is excellent in the adhesiveness with a substrate the capability of preventing whitening and abrasion resistance.

When the multifunctional acrylic acid ester resin having hydrophobicity is used there is not any specific restriction over the weight ratio of the resin versus the hollow silica microparticles a weight of the multifunctional acrylic acid ester resin having hydrophobicity versus a weight of the hollow silica microparticles but generally the ratio of 0.001 to 2 is preferable and the ratio of 0.005 to 1.5 is further preferable.

Examples of the photoinitiator and catalysts for curing include but not limited to radical initiators such as peroxides and azo compounds titanium compounds tin compounds platinum catalyst and isocyanate.

The composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention is generally prepared by mixing an organosol in which the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention are dispersed with a binder. The binder may be dispersed with an organic solvent as described above. Mixing of the organosol and the binder may be performed in the range of the weight ration described above by using a mixer or the like with active agitation to obtain the composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention.

The composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention contains an organic solvent originated from the organosol or the binder and is diluted with an organic solvent according to the application. In this case the composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention is preferably diluted with 100 to 5000 weight portions of an organic solvent against 100 weight portions of solid components including the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention and the binder.

The solvent may be subjected to solvent substitution according to a type of a surface functional group present on a surface of a used substrate or on a surface of the surface coated hollow silica microparticles. The solvents available for the purpose described above include but not limited to alcohols such as methanol ethanol isopropanol n butanol and methyl isocarbinol ketones such as acetone 2 butanone ethyl amyl ketone diacetone alcohol isohoron and cyclohexanone amides such as N N dimethyl formamide and N N dimethyl acetoamide ethers such as diethyl ether isopropyl ether tetrahydrofuran 1 4 dioxane 3 4 dihydro 2H pyran glycol ethers such as 2 methoxy ethanol 2 ethoxy ethanol 2 butoxy ethanol and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether glycol ether acetates such as 2 methoxy ethyl acetate 2 ethoxy ethyl acetate and 2 butoxy ethyl acetate esters such as methyl acetate ethyl acetate isobutyl acetate amyl acetate ethyl lactate and ethylene carbonate aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene toluene and xylene aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane heptane iso octane and cyclohexane halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride 1 2 dichlor ethane dichloropropane and chlorbenzene sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide and pyrrolidones such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone and N octyl 2 pyrrolidone. The dispersing medium may be used singly or in combination. Of these solvents a polar solvent is especially preferable.

It is allowable to add an antiseptic agent an antibiotic agent an antifoaming agent a ultraviolet degradation inhibiting agent a coloring agent a leveling agent or the like to the composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention if required.

A preferable example of the composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention contains the hollow silica microparticles having the surface charge Q in the range from 5 to 20 eq g the binder and a polar solvent. A concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles in the preferable example is in the range from 0.1 to 20 W and a concentration C of the binder as a solid component is in the range from 1 to 50 W .

The surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles is preferably in the range from 5 to 20 eq g and more preferably in the range from 6 to 18 eq g. When the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles is in the range described above the phenomenon that the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed easily occurs in a substrate with a coating film obtained by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles as described above on a substrate and the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the outer side from a middle point of the coating film in the thickness direction. The hollow silica microparticles may be dispersed either in the single layered state or in the multi layered state and also the hollow silica microparticles may be dotted.

When the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles is less than 5 eq g in the coating film obtained by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles the tendency for homogeneous dispersion of the hollow silica microparticles becomes stronger. When the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles is over 20 eq g sometimes the particles may not be hollow. Furthermore whitening easily occurs in the coating film obtained by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles and the hollow silica microparticles are apt to be dispersed homogeneously in the coating film.

As for a quantity of hollow silica microparticles contained in the composition for forming a transparent coating film the concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles is preferably in the range from 0.1 to 20 W and a concentration C of the binder as a solid content is preferably in the range from 1 to 50 W .

When the concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles is less than 0.1 W in the coating film prepared by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles it is difficult to achieve the optical characteristics and the electric characteristics provided by uneven distribution and dispersion of the hollow silica microparticles. When the concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles is over 20 W the tendency for homogeneous dispersion of the hollow silica microparticles becomes stronger in the coating film obtained by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles. The concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles is preferably in the range from 1 to 10 W .

An average particle diameter of the hollow silica microparticles used in the present invention is preferably in the range from 5 to 300 nm. The hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention should more preferably have the average particle diameter in the range from 10 to 200 nm and further preferably in the range from 10 to 100 nm.

The method of producing the composition for forming a transparent coating film described above is applied also to produce the composition for forming a transparent coating film in the preferable example 1 of the composition for forming a transparent coating film.

As another preferable example of the composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention there can be enlisted a composition for forming a transparent coating film containing hollow silica microparticles with the surface charge Q in the range from 5 to 20 eq g metal oxide particles with the surface charge Q in the range from 51 to 150 eq g a binder and a polar solvent and the composition is characterized in that a value of the difference between the surface charge Q of the metal oxide particles and the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles Q Q is in the range from 20 to 100 eq g the concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles is in the range from 0.1 to 20 W the concentration C of the metal oxide particles is in the range from 0.1 to 20 W and the concentration C of the binder as a solid component is in the range from 1 to 50 W .

Because the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles is in the range from 5 to 20 eq g the surface charge Q of the metal oxide particles is in the range from 51 to 150 eq g and a value of the difference between the surface charge Q of the metal oxide particles and the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles Q Q is in the range from 20 to 100 eq g when the composition for forming a transparent coating film is cured and converted to a coating film the tendency becomes stronger that the metal oxide particles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the inner side from the middle point of the transparent coating film in the thickness direction namely in the side closer to the substrate and the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the outer side from the middle point of the coating film in the thickness direction namely in the side closer to the surface.

It can be guessed that the phenomenon occurs because of the electrical repulsion between the hollow silica microparticles and the metal oxide particles. When the value of the difference between the surface charge Q of the metal oxide particles and the surface charge Q of the hollow silica microparticles Q Q is less than 20 eq g because the electrical repulsion between the hollow silica microparticles and the metal oxide particles is small the tendency becomes weaker that the two types of microparticles repulse each other and are distributed in different portions of the coating film.

When the value of Q Q is over 100 eq g a difference in surface charge between the two types of microparticles is too large and the hollow silica microparticles and the metal oxide particles easily aggregate respectively.

Both the concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles and the concentration C of the metal oxide particles are preferably in the range from 0.1 to 20 W respectively. When the concentrations are in this range the hollow silica microparticles and the metal oxide particles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the coating film respectively. On the other hand when the concentrations are lower than the range the effects provided by uneven distribution and dispersion of the two types of microparticles are hardly shown. When the two concentrations are over the range the tendency becomes stronger than the two types of microparticles are distributed and dispersed homogenously in the coating film. Both of the concentration C of the hollow silica microparticles and the concentration C of the metal oxide particles are preferably in the range from 1 to 10 W respectively.

As for the types of the metal oxide particles if the coating film is used as a hard coat film metal oxide microparticles of ZrO TiO SbO ZnO AlO SnO chained particles in which the microparticles above are coupled to each other in the chain like state or silica particles with the refractive index of 1.45 or below can advantageously be used.

When the transparent coating film is used as a high refractive index film it is preferable to use the metal oxide particles having a refractive index of 1.60 or more or further preferable to use the metal oxide particles having the refractive index of 1.80 or more and more specifically any of ZrO TiO SbO ZnO AlO SnO antimony doped tin oxide tin doped indium oxide tin oxide doped phosphorus PTO or the like can advantageously be used.

When the transparent coating film is used as a conductive film it is generally preferable to use as the metal oxide particles microparticles of SbO SnO antimony dopes tin oxide tin dopes indium oxide tin oxide doped phosphorus PTO silica based microparticles or silica based microparticles having cavities therein with the surface coated with any of the conductive materials.

If required the metal oxide particles having been processed with the silane compound may be used and furthermore in the method of producing hollow silica microparticles in the fifth aspect of the present invention it is allowable to use metal oxide particles in place of the hollow silica microparticles.

When the composition for forming a transparent coating film containing both hollow silica microparticles and metal oxide particles is used by applying the coating film onto a substrate it is possible to obtain a transparent coating film coated substrate coated with the transparent coating film in which the metal oxide particles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the inner side from the middle point of the coating film namely in the side closer to the substrate and the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the outer side from the middle point namely in the side closer to the surface thereof.

Also in the method of producing a composition for forming a transparent coating film in the preferable example 2 described above the metal oxide particles may be added during the process of producing the composition for forming a transparent coating film.

The transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention is prepared by curing the composition for forming a transparent coating film with or without any other coating film on a substrate.

There is not any specific restriction over a type of the substrate so long as the substrate is a solid material enabling formation of a coating film. It is allowable to use as the substrate for instance glass polycarbonate acryl resin PET TAC triacetyl cellulose an MS substrate a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and styrene a polyolefin based substrate or the like. Forms of the substrates include for instance a plastic sheet a plastic film a plastic lens a plastic panel a cathode ray tube a fluorescent display tube a liquid crystal display panel or the like.

As the other examples of coating film there can be enlisted for instance a hard coat film a flattened film a high refractive index film an insulating film a conductive resin film a conductive metal microparticle film a conductive metal oxide microparticle film a film made of a primer or the like.

It is to be noted that the transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention may be further coated for any specific application.

The transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention can be obtained by applying the composition for forming a transparent coating film onto a substrate with any known method such as the dip method the spray method the spinner method or the roll coat method drying the composition and furthermore curing the applied composition by heating or by irradiation of ultraviolet rays according to the necessity.

When the composition is cured by irradiating ultraviolet rays for instance the composition for forming a transparent coating film according to the present invention is applied onto a substrate then the applied composition is preliminarily dried at a temperature in the range from 70 C. to 100 C. and then is cured by irradiating ultraviolet rays with a high pressure mercury lamp or a fusion lamp by adjusting the wavelength to an absorption wavelength of the initiating agent namely to the range from 300 to 1 000

A refractive index of the transparent coating film according to the present invention formed on a substrate varies according to a mixing ratio of hollow silica microparticles versus a binder and also according to a refractive index of the binder generally the refractive index is low namely in the range from 1.15 to 1.42.

As a preferable example of the transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention there can be enlisted for instance a transparent film coated substrate in which the hollow silica microparticles having the average particle diameter of 5 to 300 nm and a binder are distributed on a surface thereof with the film thickness of 100 nm to 10000 nm . In this transparent film coated substrate the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the outer side from a middle point of the coating film namely in the side closer to the surface.

In the transparent film coated substrate the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the outer side from a middle point of the coating film in the thickness direction namely in the side closer to the surface as described above and also the hollow silica microparticles are present in the single layered state or in the multilayered state or may be dotted. When the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the single layered state or in the multilayered state the transparent coating film shows the strong effect of preventing reflection caused by a low refractive index of the hollow silica microparticles or of preventing electrification due to conductivity of the hollow silica microparticles.

Another preferable example of the transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention is a transparent film coated substrate having a transparent coating film with the film thickness of 100 nm to 10000 nm which is formed on a surface of the substrate and in which metal oxide microparticles with the average particle diameter of 1 to 50 nm the hollow silica microparticles with the average particle diameter of 5 to 300 nm and a binder are distributed. The transparent film coated substrate is furthermore characterized in that the metal oxide microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the inner side from a middle point of the transparent coating film namely in the side closer to the substrate and the hollow silica microparticles are unevenly distributed and dispersed in the outer side from the middle point namely in the side closer to the surface.

Because the hollow silica microparticles and the metal oxide microparticles are present in the single layered state or in the multilayered state the transparent film coated substrate has both the characteristics provided by the hollow silica microparticles including the property to prevent reflection and the property to prevent electrification and the characteristics provided by the metal oxide microparticles including the abrasion resistance adhesiveness to the substrate properties cause of the high refractive index conductivity and the like .

The composition for forming a transparent coating film containing the hollow silica microparticles according to the present invention and the transparent film coated substrate according to the present invention can be applicable to various applications requiring a low refractive index abrasion resistance and adhesiveness and can be used in surface coating for display devices in optical coating for lenses or the like.
