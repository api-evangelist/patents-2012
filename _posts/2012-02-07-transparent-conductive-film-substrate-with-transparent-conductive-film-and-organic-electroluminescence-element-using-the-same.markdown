The present invention relates to a transparent conductive film for use in various optical devices a substrate with the transparent conductive film and an organic electroluminescence element using the same.

In a general organic electroluminescence hereinafter referred to as organic EL element an organic light emitting layer is formed on a transparent substrate so as to be interposed between a pair of electrodes and light from the organic light emitting layer passes through one of the electrodes and is extracted from the substrate side. In such an organic EL element as the material of the electrode on the substrate side a material having electrical conductivity and translucency is used and indium tin oxide hereinafter referred to as ITO is widely used. However an electrode for which ITO is used as the material is fragile and is easy to break with respect to bending or physical stress. In addition in order to improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode for which ITO is used a high deposition temperature and or a high anneal temperature are needed and thus there is a concern over increased costs in the manufacturing of a device using an organic EL element.

Thus a technology of using a transparent conductive film including a plurality of thin metallic wires as an electrode instead of ITO is known e.g. see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2009 505358 . A configuration example of a substrate with such a transparent conductive film will be described with reference to . A transparent conductive film attached substrate includes a substrate having transparency and a transparent conductive film formed on the substrate . The transparent conductive film includes a plurality of thin metallic wires in the form of thin wires a first transparent resin layer as a binder and a second transparent resin layer covering the first transparent resin layer . The plurality of thin metallic wires are adhered on the substrate by the first transparent resin layer . In addition the plurality of thin metallic wires protrude from a surface of the first transparent resin layer which surface is opposite to a surface facing the substrate . Thus the surface is rugged and has poor smoothness. Therefore in order to improve the smoothness of the surface the second transparent resin layer is formed on the first transparent resin layer .

However in the case where the second transparent resin layer is applied onto the first transparent resin layer in an overlapping manner the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer may be mixed. In addition the second transparent resin layer may be damaged by the rugged first transparent resin layer . When the material of each transparent resin layer is mixed or one of the layers is damaged as described above there is the possibility that electrical conductivity is decreased or made ununiform. Furthermore the second transparent resin layer cannot be uniformly applied onto the first transparent resin layer and there is the possibility that the electrical conductivity is made ununiform on the surface of the transparent conductive film .

The present invention solves the above problem and an object of the present invention is to provide a transparent conductive film which includes a transparent resin layer including a thin metallic wire and a transparent resin layer smoothing the transparent resin layer which suppresses mixture of these transparent resin layers in which one of the transparent resin layers is less likely to be damaged by the other transparent resin layer and which has a smooth surface and uniform electrical conductivity a substrate with the transparent conductive film and an organic electroluminescence element using the same.

A transparent conductive film according to the present invention includes a first transparent resin layer including a thin metallic wire a second transparent resin layer including a conductive polymer and a third transparent resin layer provided between the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer. At least one of the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer comprises a resin which is soluble in water and the third transparent resin layer comprises a resin which is insoluble in water or has water resistance.

In the transparent conductive film the thin metallic wire is preferably a metallic nanowire or a carbon nanotube.

In the transparent conductive film preferably the third transparent resin layer is formed as a porous layer and a pore diameter of the third transparent resin layer is not less than 0.5 nm and not greater than 1 m.

In the transparent conductive film a film thickness of the porous layer is preferably not less than 5 nm and not greater than 1 m.

In the transparent conductive film a contact angle with respect to water on a surface of the third transparent resin layer is preferably not greater than 75 .

In the transparent conductive film the third transparent resin layer preferably includes a binder composed of a silicone resin.

The transparent conductive film is preferably formed on a substrate to constitute a transparent conductive film attached substrate.

The transparent conductive film attached substrate is preferably used in an organic electroluminescence element.

According to the transparent conductive film according to the present invention since the third transparent resin layer including the resin which is insoluble in water or has water resistance is provided between the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer when the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer are formed mixing of one of these layers with the other layer can be suppressed. In addition since the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer are not mixed one of these layers can be less likely to be damaged by the other. Therefore a transparent conductive film is obtained which has a smooth surface and uniform electrical conductivity.

Hereinafter a transparent conductive film according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. The transparent conductive film according to the present embodiment is formed on a substrate having translucency to constitute a transparent conductive film attached substrate and is used for example in an organic electroluminescence hereinafter referred to as organic EL element. shows a cross sectional configuration of the organic EL element. The organic EL element includes a substrate a transparent conductive film an organic light emitting layer and a conductor layer and has a configuration in which the transparent conductive film the organic light emitting layer and the conductor layer are laminated on the substrate in order. The substrate and the transparent conductive film constitute a transparent conductive film attached substrate . The transparent conductive film serves as an anode of the organic EL element to inject positive holes holes to the organic light emitting layer . Meanwhile the conductor layer serves as a cathode of the organic EL element to inject electrons to the organic light emitting layer .

It is preferred that a hole injection layer which prompts injection of positive holes from the transparent conductive film is provided between the transparent conductive film and the organic light emitting layer and it is preferred that an electron injection layer which prompts injection of electrons from the conductor layer is provided between the conductor layer and the organic light emitting layer . In addition a hole transport layer which efficiently transports positive holes and an electron transport layer which efficiently transports electrons may be provided.

In the organic EL element configured as described above when a voltage is applied between the transparent conductive film and the conductor layer with the transparent conductive film side being set at potential positive holes are injected from the transparent conductive film to the organic light emitting layer and electrons are injected from the conductor layer to the organic light emitting layer . Then the positive holes and the electrons injected to the organic light emitting layer are recombined within the organic light emitting layer whereby the organic light emitting layer emits light. The light emitted from the organic light emitting layer passes through the transparent conductive film attached substrate the transparent conductive film and the substrate and is extracted to the outside of the organic EL element . It is noted that the light applied to the conductor layer is reflected by the surface of the conductor layer passes through the transparent conductive film attached substrate and is extracted to the outside of the organic EL element .

It is noted that the material of the substrate is not particularly limited as long as it is a transparent material having translucency. As such a substrate for example a rigid transparent glass plate such as soda glass or alkali free glass a flexible transparent plastic plate such as polycarbonate or ethylene terephthalate or the like is used. In the case where the rigid transparent glass plate is used as the substrate a device using the substrate has excellent strength and the transparent conductive film can easily be formed onto the substrate . In the case where the flexible transparent plastic plate is used as the substrate a device using the substrate can be reduced in weight and can be made as a device having flexibility.

In addition as the material of the organic light emitting layer anthracene naphthalene pyrene tetracene coronene perylene phthaloperylene naphthaloperylene diphenylbutadiene tetraphenylbutadiene coumarin oxadiazole bisbenzoxazorine bisstyryl cyclopentadiene coumarin oxadiazole bisbenzoxazorine bisstyryl cyclopentadiene quinoline metal complex tris 8 hydroxyquinolinate aluminum complex tris 4 methyl 8 quinolinate aluminum complex tris 5 phenyl 8 quinolinate aluminum complex aminoquinoline metal complex benzoquinoline metal complex tri p terphenyl 4 yl amine pyrane quinacridone rubrene derivatives thereof a 1 aryl 2 5 di 2 thienyl pyrrole derivative a distyrylbenzene derivative a styrylarylene derivative a styrylamine derivative or compounds or polymers having groups composed of these luminescent materials in part of the molecules or the like is used. Furthermore for example light emitting materials such as an iridium complex an osmium complex a platinum complex or a europium complex or phosphorescence emitting materials such as compounds or polymers having these materials within the molecules can also be used. These materials can be selected and used as appropriate according to need.

In addition as the material of the conductor layer for example aluminum or the like is used. Furthermore the conductor layer may be made to have a lamination structure by combining aluminum and another material. Examples of such a combination include a laminate of an alkali metal and aluminum a laminate of an alkali metal and silver a laminate of aluminum and a halide of an alkali metal a laminate of aluminum and an oxide of an alkali metal a laminate of aluminum and an alkaline earth metal or a rare earth metal or alloys of these metal species and other metals. Specific examples thereof include a laminate of aluminum and sodium an alloy of sodium and potassium lithium magnesium or the like a laminate of a mixture of aluminum and a mixture of magnesium and silver a mixture of magnesium and indium an alloy of aluminum and lithium or lithium fluoride or a laminate of aluminum and a mixture of aluminum oxide AlO .

Next the transparent conductive film attached substrate will be described in detail with reference to . The transparent conductive film attached substrate includes the substrate and the transparent conductive film formed on the substrate . The transparent conductive film includes a first transparent resin layer including a plurality of thin metallic wires a second transparent resin layer containing a conductive polymer and a third transparent resin layer provided between the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer . The first transparent resin layer the third transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer are laminated on the substrate in order. The third transparent resin layer contains a resin which is insoluble in water or has water resistance and at least one of the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer contains a resin which is soluble in water. The first transparent resin layer the third transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer are applied onto the substrate in order.

The plurality of thin metallic wires are adhered on the substrate by the first transparent resin layer . In this state part of the plurality of thin metallic wires protrudes from a surface of the first transparent resin layer which surface is opposite to a surface facing the substrate and thus the surface of the first transparent resin layer is rugged.

The plurality of thin metallic wires included in the first transparent resin layer are in contact with or close to each other to constitute a three dimensional network. In addition part of the thin metallic wires which protrude from the first transparent resin layer extends through the third transparent resin layer to reach the second transparent resin layer . These protruding thin metallic wires electrically connect the second transparent resin layer and the first transparent resin layer and thus increased electrical conductivity of the entire transparent conductive film is kept

In the present embodiment the second transparent resin layer contains a resin which is soluble in water. When the second transparent resin layer is applied the second transparent resin layer is applied onto the third transparent resin layer formed on the first transparent resin layer with water used as a main solvent. In this case since the third transparent resin layer which contains the resin which is insoluble in water or has water resistance is interposed between the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer entry of the second transparent resin layer into the first transparent resin layer can be suppressed.

In addition in the present embodiment only the part of the thin metallic wires which protrude from the surface of the first transparent resin layer protrudes from a surface of the third transparent resin layer which surface is opposite to a surface facing the first transparent resin layer and thus the surface of the third transparent resin layer is smoothed. Therefore when the second transparent resin layer is applied the second transparent resin layer can be uniformly applied onto the third transparent resin layer .

Each thin metallic wire is composed of a fibrous metal having a line width of not less than several nm and not greater than several tens M a metal or metal fine particles. The length of each thin metallic wire is sufficiently longer than the diameter of its cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the thin metallic wire . The amount of the plurality of thin metallic wires included in the transparent conductive film is preferably not less than 0.1 mg mand not greater than 1000 mg m and more preferably not less than 1 mg mand not greater than 100 mg m. In view of the translucency of the transparent conductive film the length of each of the plurality of thin metallic wires is preferably not greater than 300 nm and the average diameter of the plurality of thin metallic wires is preferably not less than 0.3 nm and not greater than 200 nm. In addition similarly the average aspect ratio of the plurality of thin metallic wires is preferably not less than 10 and not greater than 10000. Furthermore in view of the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film the thickness of the first transparent resin layer is preferably not less than the average diameter of the plurality of thin metallic wires and not greater than 500 nm.

As the material of each thin metallic wire a fibrous carbon material a fibrous metallic material a fibrous metal oxide material a fibrous composite material or the like is used. As the fibrous carbon material for example a carbon nanotube a carbon nanofiber a carbon nanowire or the like is used. As the fibrous metallic material for example a metallic nanowire a metallic nanotube a metallic nanorod or the like is used. As the fibrous metal oxide material for example a metal oxide nanowire a metal oxide nanotube a metal oxide nanorod or the like is used. As the fibrous composite material for example an organic material fiber whose surface is coated with a metal or a metal oxide or the like is used.

Among the above materials for each thin metallic wire the metallic nanowire or the carbon nanotube is particularly preferably used. By so doing the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film can be improved and the resistance of the transparent conductive film can be reduced. In addition the light transmittance of the transparent conductive film can be improved.

The metallic nanowire is formed in the form of a thin wire and contains a metallic element. In view of the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film the length of the metallic nanowire is preferably not less than 3 m more preferably not less than 3 m and not greater than 500 m and further preferably not less than 3 m and not greater than 300 m. In addition the average diameter of the metallic nanowires is preferably not greater than 300 nm in view of the translucency of the transparent conductive film and is preferably not less than 10 nm in view of the electrical conductivity. Moreover in view of both the translucency and the electrical conductivity the average diameter of the thin metallic wires is preferably not less than 30 nm and not greater than 200 nm.

Examples of the metal contained in the metallic nanowire include silver copper gold aluminum rhodium iridium cobalt zinc nickel indium iron palladium platinum tin or titanium or alloys thereof. In order to improve the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film silver copper gold aluminum or cobalt is preferably used. The method of manufacturing the metallic nanowire is not particularly limited and a known method such as a liquid phase method or a gas phase method is used.

A carbon nanotube is a fibrous carbon material having a three dimensional structure in which a graphene sheet in which carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal net pattern is wound into a tube shape. Carbon nanotubes are classified into single layer nanotubes SWCNT single walled nanotubes composed of a single tube and multi layer nanotubes MWCNT multi walled nanotubes in which a plurality of tubes are laminated. In addition on the basis of difference in the structure of graphene sheet carbon nanotubes are classified into chiral type carbon nanotubes zigzag type carbon nanotubes and armchair type carbon nanotubes.

As the carbon nanotube a single walled nanotube having excellent electrical conductivity is preferably used and an armchair type carbon nanotube having metallic nature is more preferably used. The method of manufacturing the carbon nanotube is not particularly limited and a known method such as catalyst hydrogen reduction of carbon dioxide an arc discharge method a laser vaporization method a chemical vapor deposition CVD method or a HiPco method is used.

In view of the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film the aspect ratio of the carbon nanotube is preferably not less than 102 and more preferably not less than 103. In addition the average length of the carbon nanotubes is preferably not less than 3 m more preferably not less than 3 m and not greater than 500 m and further preferably not less than 3 m and not greater than 300 m. In addition the average diameter of the carbon nanotubes is preferably not less than 100 nm more preferably not less than 0.1 nm and not greater than 50 nm and further preferably not less than 1 nm and not greater than 30 nm.

The material of the first transparent resin layer is not particularly limited and for example silicon resin fluorine resin acrylic resin polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polymethyl methacrylate polystyrene polyether sulphone polyarylate polycarbonate resin polyurethane polyacrylonitrile polyvinyl acetal polyamide polyimide diacrylphthalate resin cellulose resin polyvinyl chloride polyvinylidene chloride polyvinyl acetate chlorinated polyethylene chlorinated polypropylene other thermoplastic resin or the like is used. In addition a copolymer of two or more of the monomers constituting these resins may be used.

In addition in order to improve the electrical conductivity and the light extraction efficiency of the first transparent resin layer nanoparticles may be added to the first transparent resin layer . As the nanoparticles for example fine particles of copper silver indium tin oxide ITO indium zinc oxide IZO tin oxide gold carbon titanium oxide zirconium oxide silicon dioxide aluminum oxide or the like are used. In addition the shapes of these nanoparticles are not particularly limited and for example these nanoparticles may be formed in spherical shapes.

The method of applying the first transparent resin layer is not particularly limited and a known method such as spin coating screen printing dip coating die coating casting spray coating or gravure coating is used. In addition in order to smooth the surfaces of the first transparent resin layer and stabilize the resistance values of these surfaces the surfaces of the first transparent resin layer may be pressed for example using a cylindrical roller.

As the conductive polymer contained in the second transparent resin layer polythiophene polyaniline polypyrrole polyphenylene polyphenylenevinylene polyacetylene polycarbazole polyacetylene or the like is used. In addition they may be used solely and may be used in combination. Moreover in order to increase the electrical conductivity doping may be performed using a dopant. The dopant is not particularly limited and for example sulphonic acid Lewis acid proton acid an alkali metal an alkaline earth metal or the like is used.

The material of the second transparent resin layer is not particularly limited and for example silicon resin fluorine resin acrylic resin polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polymethyl methacrylate polystyrene polyether sulphone polyarylate polycarbonate resin polyurethane polyacrylonitrile polyvinyl acetal polyamide polyimide diacrylphthalate resin cellulose resin polyvinyl chloride polyvinylidene chloride polyvinyl acetate chlorinated polyethylene chlorinated polypropylene other thermoplastic resin or the like is used. In addition a copolymer of two or more of the monomers constituting these resins may be used.

In addition in order to improve the electrical conductivity and the light extraction efficiency of the second transparent resin layer nanoparticles may be added to the second transparent resin layer similarly to the first transparent resin layer .

The method of applying the second transparent resin layer is the same as that for the first transparent resin layer . In addition similarly to the first transparent resin layer the surfaces of the second transparent resin layer may be pressed for example using a cylindrical roller.

The third transparent resin layer is formed as a porous layer and has a plurality of pores. In the case where the pore diameter of the third transparent resin layer is smaller than 0.5 nm the thin metallic wires cannot be caused to extend therethrough to the second transparent resin layer . Thus the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film cannot be ensured. In addition in the case where the pore diameter of the third transparent resin layer is larger than 1 m the second transparent resin layer which contains the resin which is soluble in water enters the first transparent resin layer and it is difficult to suppress mixing of the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer . Therefore the pore diameter of the third transparent resin layer is preferably not less than 0.5 nm and not greater than 1 m. Thus mixing of the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer can reliably be suppressed and the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film can be ensured.

In addition in the case where the thickness of the third transparent resin layer is smaller than 5 nm it is difficult to suppress mixing of the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer . Moreover in the case where the thickness of the third transparent resin layer is larger than 1 m the thin metallic wires cannot be caused to protrude from the surface of the third transparent resin layer and thus the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film is not kept. Therefore the thickness of the third transparent resin layer is preferably not less than 5 nm and not greater than 1 m. Thus the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film can be ensured and mixing of the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer can reliably be suppressed.

In addition the contact angle with respect to water on the surface of the third transparent resin layer is preferably not greater than 75 . Thus since coating agents that are the materials for forming the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer contain water as a main solvent in many cases the third transparent resin layer has increased wettability to such coating agents and is excellent in uniform application properties.

The material of the third transparent resin layer is not particularly limited as long as a porous layer can be formed therefrom and silicone resin fluorine resin acrylic resin polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polymethyl methacrylate polystyrene polyether sulphone polyarylate polycarbonate resin polyurethane polyacrylonitrile polyvinyl acetal polyamide polyimide diacrylphthalate resin cellulose resin polyvinyl chloride polyvinylidene chloride polyvinyl acetate chlorinated polyethylene chlorinated polypropylene other thermoplastic resin or the like is used. In addition a copolymer of two or more of the monomers constituting these resins may be used.

As the material of the third transparent resin layer a binder composed of a silicone resin is particularly preferably used. By so doing the third transparent resin layer has increased wettability to the coating agents for forming the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer and is excellent in uniform application properties.

As such a silicone resin tetraalkoxysilanes such as tetramethoxysilane tetraethoxysilane tetra n propoxysilane tetra 1 propoxysilane and tetra n butoxysilane trialkoxysilanes such as methyltrimethoxysilane methyltriethoxysilane ethyltrimethoxysilane ethyltriethoxysilane n propyltrimethoxysilane n propyltriethoxysilane i propyltrimethoxysilane i propyltriethoxysilane n butyltrimethoxysilane n butyltriethoxysilane n pentyltrimethoxysilane n hexyltrimethoxysilane n heptyltrimethoxysilane n octyltrimethoxysilane cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane cyclohexyltriethoxysilane phenyltrimethoxysilane phenyltriethoxysilane 3 chloropropyltrimethoxysilane 3 chloropropyltriethoxysilane 3 3 3 trifluoropropyltrimethoxysilane 3 3 3 trifluoropropyltriethoxysilane 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane 3 mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane 3 isocyanatepropyltrimethoxysilane 3 isocyanatepropyltriethoxysilane glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane 3 glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane 2 3 4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane 2 3 4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltriethoxysilane ureidopropyltrimethoxysilane and 3 ureidopropyltriethoxysilane or dialkoxysilanes such as dimethyldimethoxysilane dimethyldiethoxysilane diethyldimethoxysilane diethyldiethoxysilane di n propyldimethoxysilane di n propyldiethoxysilane di 1 propyldimethoxysilane di 1 propyldiethoxysilane di n butyldimethoxysilane di n butyldiethoxysilane di n pentyldimethoxysilane di n pentyldiethoxysilane di n hexyldimethoxysilane di n hexyldiethoxysilane di n heptyldimethoxysilane di n heptyldiethoxysilane di n octyldimethoxysilane di n octyldiethoxysilane di n yclohexyldimethoxysilane di n cyclohexyldiethoxysilane diphenyldimethoxysilane and diphenyldiethoxysilane are used. These alkoxysilanes can be used solely or two or more of them can be mixed and used. In addition to the polyfunctional alkoxysilane a monofunctional alkoxysilane can also be used in combination. As the monofunctional alkoxysilane for example trimethylmethoxysilane trimethylethoxysilane triethylmethoxysilane triethylethoxysilane or the like is used. Moreover methyl silicate ethyl silicate or the like which are condensates of them is also used.

In addition in order to improve the electrical conductivity and the light extraction efficiency of the third transparent resin layer nanoparticles may be added to the third transparent resin layer similarly to the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer .

The method of applying the third transparent resin layer is the same as those for the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer . In addition similarly to the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer the surfaces of the third transparent resin layer SIC correctly it should be 10 may be pressed for example using a cylindrical roller.

According to the transparent conductive film attached substrate of the present embodiment since the third transparent resin layer which contains the resin which is insoluble in water or has water resistance is provided between the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer mixing of the second transparent resin layer with the first transparent resin layer can be suppressed. In addition since the second transparent resin layer is formed on the third transparent resin layer the second transparent resin layer can be less likely to be damaged by the first transparent resin layer as compared to the case where the second transparent resin layer is formed directly on the first transparent resin layer . Moreover since the third transparent resin layer is smoother than the first transparent resin layer including the thin metallic wires the second transparent resin layer can be uniformly applied onto the third transparent resin layer . As a result the electrical conductivity of the transparent conductive film can be made uniform. When the transparent conductive film attached substrate described above is used as a substrate of an organic EL element light can be emitted with uniform brightness and a highly reliable surface emitting device can be provided.

The sample of Comparative Example 4 was produced in the same manner as Example 6 described above except that the sample of Comparative Example 1 was used as the anode of the organic EL element.

The sample of Comparative Example 5 was produced in the same manner as Example 6 described above except that the sample of Comparative Example 2 was used as the anode of the organic EL element.

The sample of Comparative Example 6 was produced in the same manner as Example 6 described above except that the sample of Comparative Example 3 was used as the anode of the organic EL element.

For the samples of Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 described above a test of measuring surface resistance a test of measuring surface roughness Ra and a test of evaluating application properties were conducted. In addition for Examples 6 to 10 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6 described above a test of evaluating operation of the organic EL element was conducted. Hereinafter the test of measuring surface resistance the test of measuring surface roughness Ra the test of evaluating application properties and the test of evaluating operation of the organic EL element will be described in order.

A surface resistance value of each sample was measured using LORESTA EP MCP T360 manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation.

A surface roughness of each sample was measured using Nanosearch Microscope SFT 3500 manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation where the measurement view was 30 m long and 30 m wide.

An inverse voltage in a direction opposite to that of a current flown when light is caused to be emitted of 5 V was applied to the organic EL element to check whether or not the organic EL lights up.

Table 1 shows the results of the above tests conducted for Examples 1 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6. It is noted that in Table 1 o indicates that application was favorably conducted on the surface of the sample and x indicates that application was unfavorably conducted on the surface of the sample.

As shown in Table 1 in measurement of surface resistance the surface resistance values were 8 to 15 in Examples 1 to 5. On the other hand in Comparative Example 3 the surface resistance value was 500 which is very high and in Comparative Example 2 the surface resistance value was unstable. In measurement of surface roughness Ra the surface roughnesses Ra were 2 to 8 nm in Examples 1 to 5. On the other hand the surface roughness Ra was 15 nm in Comparative Example 1 and the surface roughness Ra was 10 nm in Example 2 SIC correctly it should be Comparative Example 2 . In evaluation of application properties the application properties were favorable in each of Examples 1 to 5. On the other hand in Comparative Example 2 the application properties were not favorable and repellency occurred. In evaluation of operation of the organic EL element the organic EL element lit up in each of Examples 6 to 10. On the other hand the organic EL element did not light up in each of Comparative Examples 4 to 6.

These results indicate that the transparent conductive film attached substrate in which the third transparent resin layer is provided between the first transparent resin layer and the second transparent resin layer has a decreased surface resistance value and a decreased surface roughness and application properties thereof are also favorable. In addition these results also indicate that an organic EL element including such a transparent conductive film attached substrate is a highly reliable device.

The present invention is not limited to the configuration of the above embodiment and various modifications can be made without changing the gist of the present invention. For example the second transparent resin layer and the third transparent resin layer may be laminated on the substrate in order and the first transparent resin layer may contain a resin which is soluble in water. In other words in the case where a transparent resin layer which is an upper layer which is soluble in water is formed by application it suffices that in order that the transparent resin layer is not mixed with a transparent resin layer which is a lower layer a transparent resin layer containing a resin which is insoluble in water or has water resistance is provided between these layers. In addition the transparent conductive film can be used as a transparent electrode of a liquid crystal display a plasma display an organic solar cell or the like.

The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 053424 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
