The present invention concerns the use of low HER3 as a selection criterion for treating cancer patients such as ovarian cancer patients with a HER inhibitor such as pertuzumab.

Also the invention is related to the use of high HER2 HER3 ratio as a selection criterion for treating cancer patients such as ovarian cancer patients with a HER inhibitor such as pertuzumab.

In addition the invention relates to the use of high HER3 as a selection criterion for treating cancer patients with a chemotherapeutic agent for instance gemcitabine.

The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell growth differentiation and survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR ErbB1 or HER1 HER2 ErbB2 or p185 HER3 ErbB3 and HER4 ErbB4 or tyro2 .

EGFR encoded by the erbB1 gene has been causally implicated in human malignancy. In particular increased expression of EGFR has been observed in breast bladder lung head neck and stomach cancer as well as glioblastomas. Increased EGFR receptor expression is often associated with increased production of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor alpha TGF by the same tumor cells resulting in receptor activation by an autocrine stimulatory pathway. Baselga and Mendelsohn 64 127 154 1994 . Monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR or its ligands TGF and EGF have been evaluated as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such malignancies. See e.g. Baselga and Mendelsohn supra Masui et al. 44 1002 1007 1984 and Wu et al. 95 1897 1905 1995 .

The second member of the HER family p185 was originally identified as the product of the transforming gene from neuroblastomas of chemically treated rats. The activated form of the neu proto oncogene results from a point mutation valine to glutamic acid in the transmembrane region of the encoded protein. Amplification of the human homolog of nett is observed in breast and ovarian cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis Slamon et al. 235 177 182 1987 Slamon et al. 244 707 712 1989 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 968 603 . To date no point mutation analogous to that in the nett proto oncogene has been reported for human tumors. Overexpression of HER2 frequently but not uniformly due to gene amplification has also been observed in other carcinomas including carcinomas of the stomach endometrium salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreas and bladder. See among others King et al. 229 974 1985 Yokota et al. 1 765 767 1986 Fukushige et al. 6 955 958 1986 Guerin et al. 3 21 31 1988 Cohen et al. 4 81 88 1989 Yonemura et al. 51 1034 1991 Borst et al. 38 364 1990 Weiner et al. 50 421 425 1990 Kern et al. 50 5184 1990 Park et al. 49 6605 1989 Zhau et al. 3 254 257 1990 Aasland et al. 57 358 363 1988 Williams et al. 59 46 52 1991 and McCann et al. 65 88 92 1990 . HER2 may be overexpressed in prostate cancer Gu et al. 99 185 9 1996 Ross et al. 28 827 33 1997 Ross et al. 79 2162 70 1997 and Sadasivan et al. 150 126 31 1993 .

Drebin and colleagues have raised antibodies against the rat neu gene product p185See for example Drebin et al. 41 695 706 1985 Myers et al. 198 277 290 1991 and WO94 22478. Drebin et al. 2 273 277 1988 report that mixtures of antibodies reactive with two distinct regions of p185result in synergistic anti tumor effects on neu transformed NIH 3T3 cells implanted into nude mice. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 311 issued Oct. 20 1998.

Hudziak et al. 9 3 1165 1172 1989 describe the generation of a panel of HER2 antibodies which were characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SK BR 3. Relative cell proliferation of the SK BR 3 cells following exposure to the antibodies was determined by crystal violet staining of the monolayers after 72 hours. Using this assay maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56 . Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize HER2 overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF . See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 issued Oct. 14 1997. The HER2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al. 50 1550 1558 1990 Kotts et al. 26 3 59A 1990 Sarup et al. 1 72 82 1991 Shepard et al. 11 3 117 127 1991 Kumar et al. 11 2 979 986 1991 Lewis et al. 37 255 263 1993 Pietras et al. 9 1829 1838 1994 Vitetta et al. 54 5301 5309 1994 Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 Scott et al. 266 14300 5 1991 D souza et al. 91 7202 7206 1994 Lewis et al. 56 1457 1465 1996 and Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 .

A recombinant humanized version of the murine HER2 antibody 4D5 huMAb4D5 8 rhuMAb HER2 trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 is clinically active in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti cancer therapy Baselga et al. 14 737 744 1996 . Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration Sep. 25 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein.

Other HER2 antibodies with various properties have been described in Tagliabue et al. 47 933 937 1991 McKenzie et al. 4 543 548 1989 Maier et al. 51 5361 5369 1991 Bacus et al. 3 350 362 1990 Stancovski et al. 88 8691 8695 1991 Bacus et al. 52 2580 2589 1992 Xu et al. 53 401 408 1993 WO94 00136 Kasprzyk et al. 52 2771 2776 1992 Hancock et al. 51 4575 4580 1991 Shawver et al. 54 1367 1373 1994 Arteaga et al. 54 3758 3765 1994 Harwerth et al. 267 15160 15167 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 783 186 and Klapper et al. 14 2099 2109 1997 .

Homology screening has resulted in the identification of two other HER receptor family members HER3 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 183 884 and 5 480 968 as well as Kraus et al. 86 9193 9197 1989 and HER4 EP Pat Appln No 599 274 Plowman et al. 90 1746 1750 1993 and Plowman et al. 366 473 475 1993 . Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines.

The HER receptors are generally found in various combinations in cells and heterodimerization is thought to increase the diversity of cellular responses to a variety of HER ligands Earp et al. 35 115 132 1995 . EGFR is bound by six different ligands epidermal growth factor EGF transforming growth factor alpha TGF amphiregulin heparin binding epidermal growth factor HB EGF betacellulin and epiregulin Groenen et al. 11 235 257 1994 . A family of heregulin proteins resulting from alternative splicing of a single gene are ligands for HER3 and HER4. The heregulin family includes alpha beta and gamma heregulins Holmes et al. 256 1205 1210 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 869 and Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 neu differentiation factors NDFs glial growth factors GGFs acetylcholine receptor inducing activity ARIA and sensory and motor neuron derived factor SMDF . For a review see Groenen et al. 11 235 257 1994 Lemke G. . 7 247 262 1996 and Lee et al. 47 51 85 1995 . Recently three additional HER ligands were identified neuregulin 2 NRG 2 which is reported to bind either HER3 or HER4 Chang et al. 387 509 512 1997 and Carraway et at 387 512 516 1997 neuregulin 3 which binds HER4 Zhang et al. USA 94 18 9562 7 1997 and neuregulin 4 which binds HER4 Harari et al. 18 2681 89 1999 HB EGF betacellulin and epiregulin also bind to HER4.

While EGF and TGF do not bind HER2 EGF stimulates EGFR and HER2 to form a heterodimer which activates EGFR and results in transphosphorylation of HER2 in the heterodimer. Dimerization and or transphosphorylation appears to activate the HER2 tyrosine kinase. See Harp et al. supra. Likewise when HER3 is co expressed with HER2 an active signaling complex is formed and antibodies directed against HER2 are capable of disrupting this complex Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 . Additionally the affinity of HER3 for heregulin HRG is increased to a higher affinity state when co expressed with HER2. See also Levi et al. 15 1329 1340 1995 Morrissey et al. 92 1431 1435 1995 and Lewis et al. 56 1457 1465 1996 with respect to the HER2 HER3 protein complex. HER4 like HER3 forms an active signaling complex with HER2 Carraway and Cantley 78 5 8 1994 .

Pertuzumab also known as recombinant human monoclonal antibody 2C4 OMNITARG Genentech Inc South San Francisco represents the first in a new class of agents known as HER dimerization inhibitors HDI and functions to inhibit the ability of HER2 to form active heterodimers with other HER receptors such as EGFR HER1 HER3 and HER4 and is active irrespective of HER2 expression levels. See for example Harari and Yarden 19 6102 14 2000 Yarden and Sliwkowski 2 127 37 2001 Sliwkowski 10 158 9 2003 Cho et al. 421 756 60 2003 and Malik et al. 44 176 7 2003 .

Pertuzumab blockade of the formation of HER2 HER3 heterodimers in tumor cells has been demonstrated to inhibit critical cell signaling which results in reduced tumor proliferation and survival Agus et al. 2 127 37 2002 .

Pertuzumab has undergone testing as a single agent in the clinic with a phase Ia trial in patients with advanced cancers and phase II trials in patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer as well as lung and prostate cancer. In a Phase I study patients with incurable locally advanced recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard therapy were treated with pertuzumab given intravenously every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab was generally well tolerated. Tumor regression was achieved in 3 of 20 patients evaluable for response. Two patients had confirmed partial responses. Stable disease lasting for more than 2.5 months was observed in 6 of 21 patients Agus et al. 22 192 2003 . At doses of 2.0 15 mg kg the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab was linear and mean clearance ranged from 2.69 to 3.74 mL day kg and the mean terminal elimination half life ranged from 15.3 to 27.6 days.

This application relates at least in part to the surprising observation that cancer patients e.g. ovarian cancer patients whose cancer expresses HER3 at a low level respond better in human clinical trials to a HER dimerization inhibitor than those patients whose cancer expresses HER3 at a high level. Generally such patients have a high HER2 HER3 ratio due to the low level of HER3 so evaluating the relative levels of both HER2 and HER3 provides an additional or alternative means for selecting patients for therapy with a HER dimerization inhibitor.

Thus the invention herein concerns in a first aspect a method for treating a patient with a type of cancer which is able to respond to a HER inhibitor comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a HER inhibitor to the patient wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type. Examples of HER inhibitors contemplated include HER antibodies or small molecule inhibitors HER2 antibodies or small molecule inhibitors tyrosine kinase inhibitors including but not limited to lapatinib Tykerb etc. Most preferably the HER inhibitor is a HER dimerization inhibitor. Accordingly the invention provides a method for treating a patient with a type of cancer which is able to respond to a HER dimerization inhibitor comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a HER dimerization inhibitor to the patient wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type.

According to this embodiment preferably the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level which is less than the 25percentile for HER3 expression in the cancer type. Optionally such patient s cancer expresses HER2 HER3 at a level greater than 25percentile preferably greater than the median level and most preferably greater than the 75percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in the cancer type. The preferred assay for measuring HER3 and HER2 expression comprises polymerase chain reaction PCR most preferably quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qRT PCR .

Preferably the HER dimerization inhibitor is an antibody most preferably a HER2 antibody such as pertuzumab.

Preferably the cancer type to be treated or diagnosed herein is selected from the group consisting of ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer metastatic breast cancer MBC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Most preferably the cancer type treated or diagnosed herein is ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. The cancer type may be chemotherapy resistant platinum resistant advanced refractory and or recurrent. The method may extend survival including progression free survival PFS and overall survival OS in the patient.

The HER inhibitor may administered as a single anti tumor agent or may be combined with one or more other therapies. In one embodiment the HER inhibitor is administered with one or more chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine carboplatin paclitaxel docetaxel topotecan and liposomal doxorubicin and preferably an antimetabolite such as gemcitabine. The HER inhibitor may also be combined with trastuzumab erlotinib or bevacizumab.

In a further aspect the invention pertains to a method for treating a patient with ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of pertuzumab to the patient wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

 HER activation refers to activation or phosphorylation of any one or more HER receptors. Generally HER activation results in signal transduction e.g. that caused by an intracellular kinase domain of a HER receptor phosphorylating tyrosine residues in the HER receptor or a substrate polypeptide . HER activation may be mediated by HER ligand binding to a HER dimer comprising the HER receptor of interest. HER ligand binding to a HER dimer may activate a kinase domain of one or more of the HER receptors in the dimer and thereby results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in one or more of the HER receptors and or phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in additional substrate polypeptides s such as Akt or MAPK intracellular kinases see for example.

 Phosphorylation refers to the addition of one or more phosphate group s to a protein such as a HER receptor or substrate thereof.

An antibody which inhibits HER dimerization is an antibody which inhibits or interferes with formation of a HER dimer. Preferably such an antibody binds to HER2 at the heterodimeric binding site thereof. The most preferred dimerization inhibiting antibody herein is pertuzumab or MAb 2C4. Binding of 2C4 to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2 is illustrated in . Other examples of antibodies which inhibit HER dimerization include antibodies which bind to EGFR and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors for example EGFR monoclonal antibody 806 MAb 806 which binds to activated or untethered EGFR see Johns et al. 279 29 30375 30384 2004 antibodies which bind to HER3 and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors and antibodies which bind to HER4 and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors.

Preferably such an antibody blocks HER ligand activation of a HER receptor at least about as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 or a Fab fragment thereof or as pertuzumab or a Fab fragment thereof. One can evaluate the ability of an antibody to block ligand activation of a HER receptor by studying HER dimers directly or by evaluating HER activation or downstream signaling which results from HER dimerization and or by evaluating the antibody HER2 binding site etc. Assays for screening for antibodies with the ability to inhibit ligand activation of a HER receptor more effectively than trastuzumab are described in Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 and WO01 00245 Adams et al. . By way of example only one may assay for inhibition of HER dimer formation see e.g. FIG. 1A B of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 and WO01 00245 reduction in HER ligand activation of cells which express HER dimers WO01 00245 and FIG. 2A B of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for example blocking of HER ligand binding to cells which express HER dimers WO01 00245 and FIG. 2E of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for example cell growth inhibition of cancer cells e.g. MCF7 MDA MD 134 ZR 75 1 MD MB 175 T 47D cells which express HER dimers in the presence or absence of HER ligand WO01 00245 and FIGS. 3A D of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for instance inhibition of downstream signaling for instance inhibition of HRG dependent AKT phosphorylation or inhibition of HRG or TGF dependent MAPK phosphorylation see WO01 00245 and FIG. 2C D of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for example . One may also assess whether the antibody inhibits HER dimerization by studying the antibody HER2 binding site for instance by evaluating a structure or model such as a crystal structure of the antibody bound to HER2 See for example Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

A heterodimeric binding site on HER2 refers to a region in the extracellular domain of HER2 that contacts or interfaces with a region in the extracellular domain of EGFR HER3 or HER4 upon formation of a dimer therewith. The region is found in Domain II of HER2. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

The HER2 antibody may inhibit HRG dependent AKT phosphorylation and or inhibit HRG or TGF dependent MAPK phosphorylation more effectively for instance at least 2 fold more effectively than trastuzumab see Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 and WO01 00245 by way of example .

The HER2 antibody may be one which like pertuzumab does not inhibit HER2 ectodomain cleavage Molina et al. 61 4744 4749 2001 . Trastuzumab on the other hand can inhibit HER2 ectodomain cleavage.

A HER2 antibody that binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally also binds to residues in other of the domains of the HER2 extracellular domain such as domains I and III and can sterically hinder at least to some extent formation of a HER2 EGFR HER2 HER3 or HER2 HER4 heterodimer.

Herein a sample or cell that expresses a protein of interest such as a HER3 and or HER2 is one in which mRNA encoding the protein or the protein including fragments thereof is determined to be present in the sample or cell.

A sample cell tumor or cancer which expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in a type of cancer is one in which the level of HER3 expression is considered a low HER3 level to a skilled person for that type of cancer. Generally such level will be in the range from about 0 to less than about 50 relative to HER3 levels in a population of samples cells tumors or cancers of the same cancer type. For instance the population which is used to arrive at the median expression level may be ovarian cancer samples generally or subgroupings thereof such as chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer platinum resistant ovarian cancer as well as advanced refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer. The examples herein demonstrate how the median expression level can be determined. This may constitute an absolute value of expression. Thus with reference to herein the cut off for platinum resistant ovarian patients considered to express HER3 at a low level may be about 2.8 or less less than 60percentile about 2.41 or less less than 55percentile about 2.28 or less less than 50percentile about 1.88 or less less than 45percentile about 1.71 or less less than 40percentile about 1.57 or less less than 35percentile about 1.4 or less less than 30percentile about 1.19 or less less than 25percentile about 0.99 or less less than 20percentile etc. Such absolute values will be quantified in an assay under specified assay conditions such as qRT PCR disclosed herein and most preferably the qRT PCR assay as in Example 1. Preferably the level of HER3 expression is less than the 50percentile and most preferably less than the 30or 25percentile.

The expressions HER2 HER3 or HER2 to HER3 herein refer to the expression level of HER2 relative to the expression level of HER3 in a sample cell tumor or cancer. Such expression level s may be quantified using a variety of different techniques such as those disclosed herein. While this may be calculated as a ratio of HER2 expression to HER3 expression the present invention contemplates various other ways of evaluating the levels of HER2 and HER3 so as to select a patient for therapy herein including but not limited to using a decision tree where patients are selected if their expression of HER2 and or HER3 is over or under certain cut offs etc. Such various other means for comparing HER2 to HER3 are encompassed by the phrases HER2 HER3 or HER2 to HER3 herein.

A sample cell tumor or cancer which expresses HER2 HER3 a level which is greater than the 25percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in a type of cancer is one in which the ratio of HER2 expression relative to HER3 expression is not a low HER2 HER3 level for that type of cancer. Preferably such level will be in the range from greater than about 25 to about 100 relative to HER2 HER3 levels in a population of samples cells tumors or cancers of the same cancer type. For instance the population which is used to arrive at the such expression levels may be ovarian cancer samples generally or subgroupings thereof such as chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer platinum resistant ovarian cancer as well as advanced refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer. The examples herein demonstrate how the percentile expression levels can be determined. In one embodiment the HER2 HER3 level constitutes an absolute value of expression. Thus with reference to herein the cut off for platinum resistant ovarian patients expressing HER2 HER3 at this level may be about 0.82 or more greater than 25percentile about 0.90 or more greater than 30percentile about 1.06 or more greater than 35percentile about 1.13 or more greater than 40percentile about 1.26 or more greater than 45percentile about 1.53 or more greater than 50percentile about 1.70 or more greater than 55percentile about 1.86 or more greater than 60percentile about 2.15 or more greater than 65percentile about 2.49 or more greater than 70percentile about 2.62 or more greater than 75percentile about 2.92 or more greater than 80percentile etc. Such absolute values will be quantified in an assay under specified assay conditions such as qRT PCR disclosed herein and most preferably the qRT PCR assay as in Example 1. In one embodiment the level of HER2 HER3 expression is greater than the 50percentile preferably greater than the 70percentile and most preferably greater than the 75percentile. Patients whose cancer expresses HER2 HER3 at levels as described herein may or may not overexpress HER2.

The technique of polymerase chain reaction or PCR as used herein generally refers to a procedure wherein minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid RNA and or DNA are amplified as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 195 issued 28 Jul. 1987. Generally sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5 terminal nucleotides of the two primers may coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA bacteriophage or plasmid sequences etc. See generally Mullis et al. 51 263 1987 Erlich ed. PCR Technology Stockton Press NY 1989 . As used herein PCR is considered to be one but not the only example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid DNA or RNA as a primer and utilizes a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid or to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid which is complementary to a particular nucleic acid.

 Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction or qRT PCR refers to a form of PCR wherein the amount of PCR product is measured at each step in a PCR reaction. This technique has been described in various publications including Cronin et al. 164 1 35 42 2004 and Ma et al. 5 607 616 2004 .

The term microarray refers to an ordered arrangement of hybridizable array elements preferably polynucleotide probes on a substrate.

The term polynucleotide when used in singular or plural generally refers to any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. Thus for instance polynucleotides as defined herein include without limitation single and double stranded DNA DNA including single and double stranded regions single and double stranded RNA and RNA including single and double stranded regions hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single stranded or more typically double stranded or include single and double stranded regions. In addition the term polynucleotide as used herein refers to triple stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. The strands in such regions may be from the same molecule or from different molecules. The regions may include all of one or more of the molecules but more typically involve only a region of some of the molecules. One of the molecules of a triple helical region often is an oligonucleotide. The term polynucleotide specifically includes cDNAs. The term includes DNAs including cDNAs and RNAs that contain one or more modified bases. Thus DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons are polynucleotides as that term is intended herein. Moreover DNAs or RNAs comprising unusual bases such as inosine or modified bases such as tritiated bases are included within the term polynucleotides as defined herein. In general the term polynucleotide embraces all chemically enzymatically and or metabolically modified forms of unmodified polynucleotides as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells including simple and complex cells.

The term oligonucleotide refers to a relatively short polynucleotide including without limitation single stranded deoxyribonucleotides single or double stranded ribonucleotides RNA DNA hybrids and double stranded DNAs. Oligonucleotides such as single stranded DNA probe oligonucleotides are often synthesized by chemical methods for example using automated oligonucleotide synthesizers that are commercially available. However oligonucleotides can be made by a variety of other methods including in vitro recombinant DNA mediated techniques and by expression of DNAs in cells and organisms.

The phrase gene amplification refers to a process by which multiple copies of a gene or gene fragment are formed in a particular cell or cell line. The duplicated region a stretch of amplified DNA is often referred to as amplicon. Usually the amount of the messenger RNA mRNA produced also increases in the proportion of the number of copies made of the particular gene expressed.

 Stringency of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length washing temperature and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions see Ausubel et al. Wiley Interscience Publishers 1995 .

 Stringent conditions or high stringency conditions as defined herein typically 1 employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing for example 0.015 M sodium chloride 0.0015 M sodium citrate 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 C. 2 employ during hybridization a denaturing agent such as formamide for example 50 v v formamide with 0.1 bovine serum albumin 0.1 Ficoll 0.1 polyvinylpyrrolidone 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride 75 mM sodium citrate at 42 C. or 3 employ 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.75 M NaCl 0.075 M sodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 5 Denhardt s solution sonicated salmon sperm DNA 50 gr g ml 0.1 SDS and 10 dextran sulfate at 42 C. with washes at 42 C. in 0.2 SSC sodium chloride sodium citrate and 50 formamide at 55 C. followed by a high stringency wash consisting of 0.1 SSC containing EDTA at 55 C.

 Moderately stringent conditions may be identified as described by Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions e.g. temperature ionic strength and SDS less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37 C. in a solution comprising 20 formamide 5 SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 mg ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 1 SSC at about 37 50 C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature ionic strength etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.

A native sequence polypeptide is one which has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide e.g. HER receptor or HER ligand derived from nature including naturally occurring or allelic variants. Such native sequence polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. Thus a native sequence polypeptide can have the amino acid sequence of naturally occurring human polypeptide murine polypeptide or polypeptide from any other mammalian species.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments an antibody is purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by for example the Lowry method and in some embodiments to greater than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of for example a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using for example Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

 Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.

The variable region or variable domain of an antibody refers to the amino terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as VH. The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as VL. These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen binding sites.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions HVRs both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three HVRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the HVRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains antibodies immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in for example Abbas et al. 4th ed. W.B. Saunders Co. 2000 . An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule formed by covalent or non covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.

The terms full length antibody intact antibody and whole antibody are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain an Fc region.

A naked antibody for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen binding site. In one embodiment a two chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv scFv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six HVRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment contains the heavy and light chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see e.g. Pluckth n in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York 1994 pp. 269 315. scFv fragments herein specifically include small modular immunopharmaceuticals SMIPs such as disclosed in US2005 0180970A1 and US2005 0186216 A1 assigned to Trubion.

The term diabodies refers to antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 1993 01161 Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations e.g. naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler and Milstein 256 495 97 1975 Hongo et al. 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 phage display technologies see e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1992 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 and technologies for producing human or human like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences see e.g. WO 1998 24893 WO 1996 34096 WO 1996 33735 WO 1991 10741 Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATTZED antibodies wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin recipient antibody in which residues from a HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a HVR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and or capacity. In some instances FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see e.g. Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 . See also e.g. Vaswani and Hamilton 1 105 115 1998 Harris 23 1035 1038 1995 Hurle and Gross 5 428 433 1994 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 982 321 and 7 087 409.

Humanized HER2 antibodies include huMAb4D5 1 huMAb4D5 2 huMAb4D5 3 huMAb4D5 4 huMAb4D5 5 huMAb4D5 6 huMAb4D5 7 and huMAb4D5 8 or trastuzumab HERCEPTIN as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 expressly incorporated herein by reference humanized 520C9 WO93 21319 and humanized 2C4 antibodies such as pertuzumab as described herein.

For the purposes herein trastuzumab HERCEPTIN and huMAb4D5 8 refer to an antibody comprising the light and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 15 and 16 respectively.

Herein pertuzumab and OMNITARG refer to an antibody comprising the light and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 13 and 14 respectively.

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 . See also van Dijk and van de Winkel 5 368 74 2001 . Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled e.g. immunized xenomice see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 regarding XENOMOUSE technology . See also for example Li et al. 103 3557 3562 2006 regarding human antibodies generated via a human B cell hybridoma technology.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. supra. Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc. according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

Throughout the present specification and claims the Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain approximately residues 1 107 of the light chain and residues 1 113 of the heavy chain e.g Kabat et al. . 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 .

The EU numbering system or EU index is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region e.g. the EU index reported in Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 expressly incorporated herein by reference . Unless stated otherwise herein references to residues numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system e.g. see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 640 323 Figures for EU numbering .

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . In one embodiment an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies may be produced using certain procedures known in the art. For example Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and or framework residues is described by for example Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

The term Fc region herein is used to define a C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226 or from Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus thereof. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during production or purification of the antibody or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed antibody populations with no K447 residues removed and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

Unless indicated otherwise herein the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. supra. The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.

A functional Fc region possesses an effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include C1q binding CDC Fc receptor binding ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays as disclosed for example in definitions herein.

A native sequence Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region non A and A allotypes native sequence human IgG2 Fc region native sequence human IgG3 Fc region and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.

A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification preferably one or more amino acid substitution s . Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide and most preferably at least about 90 homology therewith more preferably at least about 95 homology therewith.

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see e.g. Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed for example in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein.

The term Fc receptor or FcR also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known see e.g. Ghetie and Ward. 18 12 592 598 1997 Ghetie et al. 15 7 637 640 1997 Hinton et al. 279 8 6213 6216 2004 WO 2004 92219 Hinton et al. .

Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates to which the polypeptides with a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2000 42072 Presta describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also e.g. Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function s . Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors Fcs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 or U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 Presta may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include PBMC and NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences polypeptides with a variant Fc region and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 B1 and WO 1999 51642. See also e.g. Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The term Fc region comprising antibody refers to an antibody that comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the antibody or by recombinant engineering of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody. Accordingly a composition comprising an antibody having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise an antibody with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

The term main species antibody herein refers to the antibody structure in a composition which is the quantitatively predominant antibody molecule in the composition. In one embodiment the main species antibody is a HER2 antibody such as an antibody that binds to Domain II of HER2 antibody that inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than trastuzumab and or an antibody which binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of the main species antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4 and most preferably comprising the light chain and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 13 and 14 pertuzumab .

An amino acid sequence variant antibody herein is an antibody with an amino acid sequence which differs from a main species antibody. Ordinarily amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70 homology with the main species antibody and preferably they will be at least about 80 more preferably at least about 90 homologous with the main species antibody. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions deletions and or additions at certain positions within or adjacent to the amino acid sequence of the main species antibody. Examples of amino acid sequence variants herein include an acidic variant e.g. deamidated antibody variant a basic variant an antibody with an amino terminal leader extension e.g. VHS on one or two light chains thereof an antibody with a C terminal lysine residue on one or two heavy chains thereof etc and includes combinations of variations to the amino acid sequences of heavy and or light chains. The antibody variant of particular interest herein is the antibody comprising an amino terminal leader extension on one or two light chains thereof optionally further comprising other amino acid sequence and or glycosylation differences relative to the main species antibody.

A glycosylation variant antibody herein is an antibody with one or more carbohydrate moeities attached thereto which differ from one or more carbohydate moieties attached to a main species antibody. Examples of glycosylation variants herein include antibody with a G1 or G2 oligosaccharide structure instead a G0 oligosaccharide structure attached to an Fc region thereof antibody with one or two carbohydrate moieties attached to one or two light chains thereof antibody with no carbohydrate attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody etc and combinations of glycosylation alterations.

Where the antibody has an Fc region an oligosaccharide structure may be attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody e.g. at residue 299 298 Eu numbering of residues . For pertuzumab G0 was the predominant oligosaccharide structure with other oligosaccharide structures such as G0 F G 1 Man5 Man6 G1 1 G1 1 6 G1 1 3 and G2 being found in lesser amounts in the pertuzumab composition.

Unless indicated otherwise a G1 oligosaccharide structure herein includes G 1 G1 1 G1 1 6 and G1 1 3 structures.

An amino terminal leader extension herein refers to one or more amino acid residues of the amino terminal leader sequence that are present at the amino terminus of any one or more heavy or light chains of an antibody. An exemplary amino terminal leader extension comprises or consists of three amino acid residues VHS present on one or both light chains of an antibody variant.

A deamidated antibody is one in which one or more asparagine residues thereof has been derivitized e.g. to an aspartic acid a succinimide or an iso aspartic acid.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A cancer type herein refers to a particular category or indication of cancer. Examples of such cancer types include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma including medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma sarcoma including liposarcoma and synovial cell sarcoma neuroendocrine tumors including carcinoid tumors gastrinoma and islet cell cancer mesothelioma schwannoma including acoustic neuroma meningioma adenocarcinoma melanoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer SCLC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer including metastatic breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma testicular cancer esophagael cancer tumors of the biliary tract as well as head and neck cancer as well as subtypes of any of such cancers including but not limited to chemotherapy resistant platinum resistant advanced refractory and or recurrent types thereof.

A cancer type which is able to respond to a HER inhibitor is one which when treated with a HER inhibitor such as a HER2 antibody or small molecule inhibitor shows a therapeutically effective benefit in the patient therewith according to any of the criteria for therapeutic effectiveness known to the skilled oncologist including those elaborated herein but particularly in terms of survival including progression free survival PFS and or overall survival OS . Preferably such cancer is selected from ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer metastatic breast cancer MBC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Most preferably the cancer is ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer including platinum resistant forms of such cancers as well as advanced refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer.

A cancer type which is able to respond to a HER dimerization inhibitor is one which when treated with a HER dimerization inhibitor such as pertuzumab shows a therapeutically effective benefit in the patient therewith according to any of the criteria for therapeutic effectiveness known to the skilled oncologist including those elaborated herein but particularly in terms of survival including progression free survival PFS and or overall survival OS . Preferably such cancer is selected from ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer metastatic breast cancer MBC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Most preferably the cancer is ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer including platinum resistant forms of such cancers as well as advanced refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer.

An effective response and similar wording refers to a response to the HER dimerization inhibitor HER inhibitor or chemotherapeutic agent that is significantly higher than a response from a patient that does not express HER3 at the designated level.

An advanced cancer is one which has spread outside the site or organ of origin either by local invasion or metastasis.

A refractory cancer is one which progresses even though an anti tumor agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent is being administered to the cancer patient. An example of a refractory cancer is one which is platinum refractory.

A recurrent cancer is one which has regrown either at the initial site or at a distant site after a response to initial therapy.

Herein a patient is a human patient. The patient may be a cancer patient i.e. one who is suffering or at risk for suffering from one or more symptoms of cancer.

A tumor sample herein is a sample derived from or comprising tumor cells from a patient s tumor. Examples of tumor samples herein include but are not limited to tumor biopsies circulating tumor cells circulating plasma proteins ascitic fluid primary cell cultures or cell lines derived from tumors or exhibiting tumor like properties as well as preserved tumor samples such as formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples or frozen tumor samples.

An embedded tumor sample is one surrounded by a firm and generally hard medium such as paraffin wax celloidin or a resin. Embedding makes possible the cutting of thin sections for microscopic examination or for generation of tissue microarrays TMAs .

A paraffin embedded tumor sample is one surrounded by a purified mixture of solid hydrocarbons derived from petroleum.

A cancer or biological sample which displays HER expression amplification or activation is one which in a diagnostic test expresses including overexpresses a HER receptor has amplified HER gene and or otherwise demonstrates activation or phosphorylation of a HER receptor.

A cancer cell with HER receptor overexpression or amplification is one which has significantly higher levels of a HER receptor protein or gene compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. HER receptor overexpression or amplification may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the HER protein present on the surface of a cell e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay IHC . Alternatively or additionally one may measure levels of HER encoding nucleic acid in the cell e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH see WO98 45479 published October 1998 southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques such as quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR . One may also study HER receptor overexpression or amplification by measuring shed antigen e.g. HER extracellular domain in a biological fluid such as serum see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 933 294 issued Jun. 12 1990 WO91 05264 published Apr. 18 1991 U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 638 issued Mar. 28 1995 and Sias et al. 132 73 80 1990 . Aside from the above assays various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.

Conversely a cancer which does not overexpress or amplify HER receptor is one which does not have higher than normal levels of HER receptor protein or gene compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Antibodies that inhibit HER dimerization such as pertuzumab may be used to treat cancer which does not overexpress or amplify HER2 receptor.

Herein an anti tumor agent refers to a drug used to treat cancer. Non limiting examples of anti tumor agents herein include chemotherapeutic agents HER inhibitors HER dimerization inhibitors HER antibodies antibodies directed against tumor associated antigens anti hormonal compounds cytokines EGFR targeted drugs anti angiogenic agents tyrosine kinase inhibitors growth inhibitory agents and antibodies cytotoxic agents antibodies that induce apoptosis COX inhibitors farnesyl transferase inhibitors antibodies that binds oncofetal protein CA 125 HER2 vaccines Raf or ras inhibitors liposomal doxorubicin topotecan taxane dual tyrosine kinase inhibitors TLK286 EMD 7200 pertuzumab trastuzumab erlotinib and bevacizumab.

An approved anti tumor agent is a drug used to treat cancer which has been accorded marketing approval by a regulatory authority such as the Food and Drug Administration FDA or foreign equivalent thereof.

Where a HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor is administered as a single anti tumor agent it is the only anti tumor agent administered to treat the cancer i.e. it is not administered in combination with another anti tumor agent such as chemotherapy.

By standard of care herein is intended the anti tumor agent or agents that are routinely used to treat a particular form of cancer. For example for platinum resistant ovarian cancer the standard of care is topotecan or liposomal doxorubicin.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell especially a HER expressing cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of HER expressing cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13.

Examples of growth inhibitory antibodies are those which bind to HER2 and inhibit the growth of cancer cells overexpressing HER2. Preferred growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies inhibit growth of SK BR 3 breast tumor cells in cell culture by greater than 20 and preferably greater than 50 e.g. from about 50 to about 100 at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml where the growth inhibition is determined six days after exposure of the SK BR 3 cells to the antibody see U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 issued Oct. 14 1997 . The SK BR 3 cell growth inhibition assay is described in more detail in that patent and hereinbelow. The preferred growth inhibitory antibody is a humanized variant of murine monoclonal antibody 4D5 e.g. trastuzumab.

An antibody which induces apoptosis is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies . The cell is usually one which overexpresses the HER2 receptor. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell e.g. a breast ovarian stomach endometrial salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreatic or bladder cell. In vitro the cell may be a SK BR 3 BT474 Calu 3 cell MDA MB 453 MDA MB 361 or SKOV3 cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example phosphatidyl serine PS translocation can be measured by annexin binding DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering and nuclear chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably the antibody which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold preferably about 5 to 50 fold and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay using BT474 cells see below . Examples of HER2 antibodies that induce apoptosis are 7C2 and 7F3.

The epitope 2C4 is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 2C4 binds. In order to screen for antibodies which bind to the 2C4 epitope a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. Preferably the antibody blocks 2C4 s binding to HER2 by about 50 or more. Alternatively epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. Epitope 2C4 comprises residues from Domain II in the extracellular domain of HER2. 2C4 and pertuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 at the junction of domains I II and III. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

The epitope 4D5 is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 4D5 ATCC CRL 10463 and trastuzumab bind. This epitope is close to the transmembrane domain of HER2 and within Domain IV of HER2. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 4D5 epitope a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. Alternatively epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about residue 529 to about residue 625 inclusive of the HER2 ECD residue numbering including signal peptide .

The epitope 7C2 7F3 is the region at the N terminus within Domain I of the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the 7C2 and or 7F3 antibodies each deposited with the ATCC see below bind. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 7C2 7F3 epitope a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. Alternatively epitope mapping can be performed to establish whether the antibody binds to the 7C2 7F3 epitope on HER2 e.g. any one or more of residues in the region from about residue 22 to about residue 53 of the HER2ECD residue numbering including signal peptide .

 Treatment refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with cancer as well as those in which cancer is to be prevented. Hence the patient to be treated herein may have been diagnosed as having cancer or may be predisposed or susceptible to cancer.

The terms therapeutically effective amount or effective amount refer to an amount of a drug effective to treat cancer in the patient. The effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. The effective amount may extend progression free survival e.g. as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors RECIST or CA 125 changes result in an objective response including a partial response PR or complete respose CR improve survival including overall survival and progression free survival and or improve one or more symptoms of cancer e.g. as assessed by FOSI . Most preferably the therapeutically effective amount of the drug is effective to improve progression free survival PFS and or overall survival OS .

 Survival refers to the patient remaining alive and includes overall survival as well as progression free survival.

 Overall survival refers to the patient remaining alive for a defined period of time such as 1 year 5 years etc from the time of diagnosis or treatment.

 Progression free survival refers to the patient remaining alive without the cancer progressing or getting worse.

By extending survival is meant increasing overall or progression free survival in a treated patient relative to an untreated patient i.e. relative to a patient not treated with a HER inhibitor HER dimerization inhibitor such as pertuzumab or relative to a patient who does not express HER3 or HER2 HER3 at the designated level and or relative to a patient treated with an approved anti tumor agent such as topotecan or liposomal doxorubicin where the cancer is ovarian cancer .

An objective response refers to a measurable response including complete response CR or partial response PR .

By complete response or CR is intended the disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment. This does not always mean the cancer has been cured.

 Partial response or PR refers to a decrease in the size of one or more tumors or lesions or in the extent of cancer in the body in response to treatment.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. At I I Y Re Re Sm B Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu chemotherapeutic agents and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including fragments and or variants thereof.

A fixed or flat dose of a therapeutic agent herein refers to a dose that is administered to a human patient without regard for the weight WT or body surface area BSA of the patient. The fixed or flat dose is therefore not provided as a mg kg dose or a mg mdose but rather as an absolute amount of the therapeutic agent.

A loading dose herein generally comprises an initial dose of a therapeutic agent administered to a patient and is followed by one or more maintenance dose s thereof. Generally a single loading dose is administered but multiple loading doses are contemplated herein. Usually the amount of loading dose s administered exceeds the amount of the maintenance dose s administered and or the loading dose s are administered more frequently than the maintenance dose s so as to achieve the desired steady state concentration of the therapeutic agent earlier than can be achieved with the maintenance dose s .

A maintenance dose herein refers to one or more doses of a therapeutic agent administered to the patient over a treatment period. Usually the maintenance doses are administered at spaced treatment intervals such as approximately every week approximately every 2 weeks approximately every 3 weeks or approximately every 4 weeks.

A medicament is an active drug to treat cancer such as a HER inhibitor a HER dimerization inhibitor such as pertuzumab or a chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine .

A target audience is a group of people or an institution to whom or to which a particular medicament is being promoted or intended to be promoted as by marketing or advertising especially for particular uses treatments or indications such as individual patients patient populations readers of newspapers medical literature and magazines television or internet viewers radio or internet listeners physicians drug companies etc.

A package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications other therapeutic products to be combined with the packaged product and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products etc.

Since in the preferred embodiment the HER inhibitor is an antibody a description follows as to exemplary techniques for the production of HER antibodies used in accordance with the present invention. The HER antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be e.g. a soluble form of the extracellular domain of a HER receptor or a portion thereof containing the desired epitope. Alternatively cells expressing HER at their cell surface e.g. NIH 3T3 cells transformed to overexpress HER2 or a carcinoma cell line such as SK BR 3 cells see Stancovski et al. 88 8691 8695 1991 can be used to generate antibodies. Other forms of HER receptor useful for generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized e.g. keyhole limpet hemocyanin serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent for example maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably the animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen but conjugated to a different protein and or through a different cross linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Various methods for making monoclonal antibodies herein are available in the art. For example the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and P ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide.

Typically such non immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework region FR for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

WO01 00245 describes production of exemplary humanized HER2 antibodies which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The humanized antibody of particular interest herein blocks EGF TGF and or HRG mediated activation of MAPK essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 or a Fab fragment thereof and or binds HER2 essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 or a Fab fragment thereof . The humanized antibody herein may for example comprise nonhuman hypervariable region residues incorporated into a human variable heavy domain and may further comprise a framework region FR substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of 69H 71H and 73H utilizing the variable domain numbering system set forth in Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . In one embodiment the humanized antibody comprises FR substitutions at two or all of positions 69H 71H and 73H.

An exemplary humanized antibody of interest herein comprises variable heavy domain complementarity determining residues GFTFTDYTMX where X is preferrably D or S SEQ ID NO 7 DVNPNSGGSIYNQRFKG SEQ ID NO 8 and or NLGPSFYFDY SEQ ID NO 9 optionally comprising amino acid modifications of those CDR residues e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable heavy CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation e.g. as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable heavy domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 4.

The humanized antibody may comprise variable light domain complementarity determining residues KASQDVSIGVA SEQ ID NO 10 SASYXXX where Xis preferably R or L Xis preferably Y or E and Xis preferably T or S SEQ ID NO 11 and or QQYYIYPYT SEQ ID NO 12 e.g. in addition to those variable heavy domain CDR residues in the preceding paragraph. Such humanized antibodies optionally comprise amino acid modifications of the above CDR residues e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable light CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation e.g. as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable light domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 3.

The present application also contemplates affinity matured antibodies which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The parent antibody may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody e.g. one comprising the variable light and or variable heavy sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4 respectively i.e. comprising the VL and or VH of pertuzumab . The affinity matured antibody preferably binds to HER2 receptor with an affinity superior to that of murine 2C4 or pertuzumab e.g. from about two or about four fold to about 100 fold or about 1000 fold improved affinity e.g. as assessed using a HER2 extracellular domain ECD ELISA . Exemplary variable heavy CDR residues for substitution include H28 H30 H34 H35 H64 H96 H99 or combinations of two or more e.g. two three four five six or seven of these residues . Examples of variable light CDR residues for alteration include L28 L50 L53 L56 L91 L92 L93 L94 L96 L97 or combinations of two or more e.g. two to three four five or up to about ten of these residues .

Various forms of the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody. The preferred intact IgG1 antibody comprises the light chain sequence in SEQ ID NO 13 and the heavy chain sequence in SEQ ID NO 14.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 591 669 5 589 369 and 5 545 807. Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats for their review see e.g. Johnson Kevin S and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

Human HER2 antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 772 997 issued Jun. 30 1998 and WO 97 00271 published Jan. 3 1997.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments comprising one or more antigen binding regions. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the HER2 protein. Other such antibodies may combine a HER2 binding site with binding site s for EGFR HER3 and or HER4. Alternatively a HER2 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD2 or CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the HER2 expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express HER2. These antibodies possess a HER2 binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific HER2 Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific HER2 Fc RI antibody IDM1 Osidem . A bispecific HER2 Fc antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific HER2 CD3 antibody. MDX 210 is a bispecific HER2 Fc RIII Ab.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain V connected to a light chain variable domain V by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

Amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post translational processes of the antibody such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions . If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to the antibody to improve its stability particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and human HER2. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.

Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L. See also US 2004 0093621 A1 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO03 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO97 30087 Patel et al. See also WO98 58964 Raju S. and WO99 22764 Raju S. concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 .

WO00 42072 Presta L. describes antibodies with improved ADCC function in the presence of human effector cells where the antibodies comprise amino acid substitutions in the Fc region thereof. Preferably the antibody with improved ADCC comprises substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Preferably the altered Fc region is a human IgG1 Fc region comprising or consisting of substitutions at one two or three of these positions. Such substitutions are optionally combined with substitution s which increase C1q binding and or CDC.

Antibodies with altered C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC are described in WO99 51642 U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 242 195B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 528 624B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 538 124 Idusogie et al. . The antibodies comprise an amino acid substitution at one or more of amino acid positions 270 322 326 327 329 313 333 and or 334 of the Fc region thereof Eu numbering of residues .

To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

Antibodies with improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and increased half lives are described in WO00 42072 Presta L. and US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. For example the Fc region may have substitutions at one or more of positions 238 250 256 265 272 286 303 305 307 311 312 314 317 340 356 360 362 376 378 380 382 413 424 428 or 434 Eu numbering of residues . The preferred Fc region comprising antibody variant with improved FcRn binding comprises amino acid substitutions at one two or three of positions 307 380 and 434 of the Fc region thereof Eu numbering of residues .

Engineered antibodies with three or more preferably four functional antigen binding sites are also contemplated US Appin No. US2002 0004587 A1 Miller et al. .

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

Techniques for generating antibodies have been described above. One may further select antibodies with certain biological characteristics as desired.

To identify an antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor the ability of the antibody to block HER ligand binding to cells expressing the HER receptor e.g. in conjugation with another HER receptor with which the HER receptor of interest forms a HER hetero oligomer may be determined. For example cells naturally expressing or transfected to express HER receptors of the HER hetero oligomer may be incubated with the antibody and then exposed to labeled HER ligand. The ability of the antibody to block ligand binding to the HER receptor in the HER hetero oligomer may then be evaluated.

For example inhibition of HRG binding to MCF7 breast tumor cell lines by HER2 antibodies may be performed using monolayer MCF7 cultures on ice in a 24 well plate format essentially as described in WO01 00245. HER2 monoclonal antibodies may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes. I labeled rHRG 1 25 pm may then be added and the incubation may be continued for 4 to 16 hours. Dose response curves may be prepared and an ICvalue may be calculated for the antibody of interest. In one embodiment the antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor will have an ICfor inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay of about 50 nM or less more preferably 10 nM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment the ICfor inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay may for example be about 100 nM or less more preferably 50 nM or less.

Alternatively or additionally the ability of an antibody to block HER ligand stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a HER receptor present in a HER hetero oligomer may be assessed. For example cells endogenously expressing the HER receptors or transfected to expressed them may be incubated with the antibody and then assayed for HER ligand dependent tyrosine phosphorylation activity using an anti phosphotyrosine monoclonal which is optionally conjugated with a detectable label . The kinase receptor activation assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 863 is also available for determining HER receptor activation and blocking of that activity by an antibody.

In one embodiment one may screen for an antibody which inhibits HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF7 cells essentially as described in WO01 00245. For example the MCF7 cells may be plated in 24 well plates and monoclonal antibodies to HER2 may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature then rHRG 1may be added to each well to a final concentration of 0.2 nM and the incubation may be continued for 8 minutes. Media may be aspirated from each well and reactions may be stopped by the addition of 100 l of SDS sample buffer 5 SDS 25 mM DTT and 25 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 . Each sample 25 l may be electrophoresed on a 4 12 gradient gel Novex and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antiphosphotyrosine at 1 g ml immunoblots may be developed and the intensity of the predominant reactive band at M 180 000 may be quantified by reflectance densitometry. The antibody selected will preferably significantly inhibit HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation to about 0 35 of control in this assay. A dose response curve for inhibition of HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation as determined by reflectance densitometry may be prepared and an ICfor the antibody of interest may be calculated. In one embodiment the antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor will have an ICfor inhibiting HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay of about 50 nM or less more preferably 10 nM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment the ICfor inhibiting HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay may for example be about 100 nM or less more preferably 50 nM or less.

One may also assess the growth inhibitory effects of the antibody on MDA MB 175 cells e.g essentially as described in Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 . According to this assay MDA MB 175 cells may be treated with a HER2 monoclonal antibody 10 g mL for 4 days and stained with crystal violet. Incubation with a HER2 antibody may show a growth inhibitory effect on this cell line similar to that displayed by monoclonal antibody 2C4. In a further embodiment exogenous HRG will not significantly reverse this inhibition. Preferably the antibody will be able to inhibit cell proliferation of MDA MB 175 cells to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 4D5 and optionally to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 7F3 both in the presence and absence of exogenous HRG.

In one embodiment the HER2 antibody of interest may block heregulin dependent association of HER2 with HER3 in both MCF7 and SK BR 3 cells as determined in a co immunoprecipitation experiment such as that described in WO01 00245 substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 4D5 and preferably substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 7F3.

To identify growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies one may screen for antibodies which inhibit the growth of cancer cells which overexpress HER2. In one embodiment the growth inhibitory antibody of choice is able to inhibit growth of SK BR 3 cells in cell culture by about 20 100 and preferably by about 50 100 at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml. To identify such antibodies the SK BR 3 assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 can be performed. According to this assay SK BR 3 cells are grown in a 1 1 mixture of F12 and DMEM medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum glutamine and penicillin streptomycin. The SK BR 3 cells are plated at 20 000 cells in a 35 mm cell culture dish 2 mls 35 mm dish . 0.5 to 30 g ml of the HER2 antibody is added per dish. After six days the number of cells compared to untreated cells are counted using an electronic COULTER cell counter. Those antibodies which inhibit growth of the SK BR 3 cells by about 20 100 or about 50 100 may be selected as growth inhibitory antibodies. See U.S. Pat No. 5 677 171 for assays for screening for growth inhibitory antibodies such as 4D5 and 3E8.

In order to select for antibodies which induce apoptosis an annexin binding assay using BT474 cells is available. The BT474 cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 10 g ml of the monoclonal antibody. Following a three day incubation period monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged resuspended in Ca binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as discussed above for the cell death assay. Tubes then receive labeled annexin e.g. annexin V FTIC 1 g ml . Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCANT flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are selected as apoptosis inducing antibodies. In addition to the annexin binding assay a DNA staining assay using BT474 cells is available. In order to perform this assay BT474 cells which have been treated with the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9 g ml HOECHST 33342 for 2 hr at 37 C. then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE flow cytometer Coulter Corporation using MODFIT LT software Verity Software House . Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater and preferably 3 fold or greater than untreated cells up to 100 apoptotic cells may be selected as pro apoptotic antibodies using this assay. See WO98 17797 for assays for screening for antibodies which induce apoptosis such as 7C2 and 7F3.

To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on HER2 bound by an antibody of interest a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed to assess whether the antibody cross blocks binding of an antibody such as 2C4 or pertuzumab to HER2. Alternatively or additionally epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art and or one can study the antibody HER2 structure Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 to see what domain s of HER2 is are bound by the antibody.

Generally about 20 or less e.g. from about 1 to about 15 for instance from 5 to about 15 of the antibody molecules in the composition comprise an amino terminal leader extension. Such percentage amounts are preferably determined using quantitative N terminal sequence analysis or cation exchange analysis preferably using a high resolution weak cation exchange column such as a PROPAC WCX 10 cation exchange column . Aside from the amino terminal leader extension variant further amino acid sequence alterations of the main species antibody and or variant are contemplated including but not limited to an antibody comprising a C terminal lysine residue on one or both heavy chains thereof a deamidated antibody variant etc.

Moreover the main species antibody or variant may further comprise glycosylation variations non limiting examples of which include antibody comprising a G1 or G2 oligosaccharide structure attached to the Fc region thereof antibody comprising a carbohydrate moiety attached to a light chain thereof e.g. one or two carbohydrate moieties such as glucose or galactose attached to one or two light chains of the antibody for instance attached to one or more lysine residues antibody comprising one or two non glycosylated heavy chains or antibody comprising a sialidated oligosaccharide attached to one or two heavy chains thereof etc.

The composition may be recovered from a genetically engineered cell line e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cell line expressing the HER2 antibody or may be prepared by peptide synthesis.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent toxin e.g. a small molecule toxin or an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including fragments and or variants thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin a maytansine U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 a trichothene and CC1065 are also contemplated herein.

In one preferred embodiment of the invention the antibody is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule . Maytansine may for example be converted to May SS Me which may be reduced to May SH3 and reacted with modified antibody Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 to generate a maytansinoid antibody immunoconjugate.

Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 and Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 714 586 5 712 374 5 264 586 and 5 773 001 expressly incorporated herein by reference.

See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated HER2 antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi212 Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane TT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 may be used.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.

Other immunoconjugates are contemplated herein. For example the antibody may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. The antibody also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Oslo A. Ed. 1980 .

The antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

In a first aspect the invention herein provides a method for selecting a therapy for a patient with a type of cancer e.g. ovarian cancer which is able to respond to a HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor e.g. pertuzumab comprising determining HER3 expression in a cancer sample from the patient and selecting a HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor as the therapy if the cancer sample expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type and or if the cancer sample expresses HER2 HER3 at a level which is greater than the 25percentile or greater than the median level for HER2 HER3 expression in the cancer type.

In a second aspect the invention provides a method for selecting a therapy for a patient with a type of cancer e.g. ovarian cancer which is able to respond to a chemotherapeutic agent comprising determining HER3 expression in a cancer sample from the patient and selecting a chemotherapeutic agent e.g. gemcitabine as the therapy if the cancer sample expresses HER3 at a level greater than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type.

The median or percentile expression level can be determined essentially contemporaneously with measuring HER3 expression or HER2 and HER3 expression or may have been determined previously.

Prior to the therapeutic methods described below HER3 expression level s and optionally HER2 expression level s in the patient s cancer is are assessed. Generally a biological sample is obtained from the patient in need of therapy which sample is subjected to one or more diagnostic assay s usually at least one in vitro diagnostic IVD assay. However other forms of evaluating HER3 and or HER2 expression such as in vivo diagnosis are expressly contemplated herein. The biological sample is usually a tumor sample preferably from ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer metastatic breast cancer MBC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer or colorectal cancer tumor sample.

The biological sample herein may be a fixed sample e.g. a formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE sample or a frozen sample.

Various methods for determining expression of mRNA or protein include but are not limited to gene expression profiling polymerase chain reaction PCR including quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR microarray analysis serial analysis of gene expression SAGE MassARRAY Gene Expression Analysis by Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing MPSS proteomics immunohistochemistry IHC etc. Preferably mRNA is quantified. Such mRNA analysis is preferably performed using the technique of polymerase chain reaction PCR or by microarray analysis. Where PCR is employed a preferred form of PCR is quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR . The preferred qRT PCR assay is that as described in Example 1 below.

The steps of a representative protocol for profiling gene expression using fixed paraffin embedded tissues as the RNA source including mRNA isolation purification primer extension and amplification are given in various published journal articles for example Godfrey et al. 2 84 91 2000 Specht et al. 158 419 29 2001 . Briefly a representative process starts with cutting about 10 microgram thick sections of paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples. The RNA is then extracted and protein and DNA are removed. After analysis of the RNA concentration RNA repair and or amplification steps may be included if necessary and RNA is reverse transcribed using gene specific promoters followed by PCR. Finally the data are analyzed to identify the best treatment option s available to the patient on the basis of the characteristic gene expression pattern identified in the tumor sample examined.

In general methods of gene expression profiling can be divided into two large groups methods based on hybridization analysis of polynucleotides and methods based on sequencing of polynucleotides. The most commonly used methods known in the art for the quantification of mRNA expression in a sample include northern blotting and in situ hybridization Parker Barnes 106 247 283 1999 RNAse protection assays Hod Biotechniques 13 852 854 1992 and polymerase chain reaction PCR Weis et al. 8 263 264 1992 . Alternatively antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes including DNA duplexes RNA duplexes and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. Representative methods for sequencing based gene expression analysis include Serial Analysis of Gene Expression SAGE and gene expression analysis by massively parallel signature sequencing MPSS .

Of the techniques listed above a sensitive and flexible quantitative method is PCR which can be used to compare mRNA levels in different sample populations in normal and tumor tissues with or without drug treatment to characterize patterns of gene expression to discriminate between closely related mRNAs and to analyze RNA structure.

The first step is the isolation of mRNA from a target sample. The starting material is typically total RNA isolated from human tumors or tumor cell lines and corresponding normal tissues or cell lines respectively. Thus RNA can be isolated from a variety of primary tumors including breast lung colon prostate brain liver kidney pancreas spleen thymus testis ovary uterus etc. tumor or tumor cell lines with pooled DNA from healthy donors. If the source of mRNA is a primary tumor mRNA can be extracted for example from frozen or archived paraffin embedded and fixed e.g. formalin fixed tissue samples. General methods for mRNA extraction are well known in the art and are disclosed in standard textbooks of molecular biology including Ausubel et al. John Wiley and Sons 1997 . Methods for RNA extraction from paraffin embedded tissues are disclosed for example in Rupp and Locker 56 A67 1987 and De Andr s et al. 18 42044 1995 . In particular RNA isolation can be performed using purification kit buffer set and protease from commercial manufacturers such as Qiagen according to the manufacturer s instructions. For example total RNA from cells in culture can be isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini columns. Other commercially available RNA isolation kits include MASTERPURE Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit EPICENTRE Madison Wis. and Paraffin Block RNA Isolation Kit Ambion Inc. . Total RNA from tissue samples can be isolated using RNA Stat 60 Tel Test . RNA prepared from tumor can be isolated for example by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation.

As RNA cannot serve as a template for PCR the first step in gene expression profiling by PCR is the reverse transcription of the RNA template into cDNA followed by its exponential amplification in a PCR reaction. The two most commonly used reverse transcriptases are avilo myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase AMV RT and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase MMLV RT . The reverse transcription step is typically primed using specific primers random hexamers or oligo dT primers depending on the circumstances and the goal of expression profiling. For example extracted RNA can be reverse transcribed using a GENEAMPT RNA PCR kit Perkin Elmer Calif. USA following the manufacturer s instructions. The derived cDNA can then be used as a template in the subsequent PCR reaction. Although the PCR step can use a variety of thermostable DNA dependent DNA polymerases it typically employs the Taq DNA polymerase which has a 5 3 nuclease activity but lacks a 3 5 proofreading endonuclease activity. Thus TAQMAN PCR typically utilizes the 5 nuclease activity of Taq or Tth polymerase to hydrolyze a hybridization probe bound to its target amplicon but any enzyme with equivalent 5 nuclease activity can be used. Two oligonucleotide primers are used to generate an amplicon typical of a PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide or probe is designed to detect nucleotide sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non extendible by Taq DNA polymerase enzyme and is labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser induced emission from the reporter dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they are on the probe. During the amplification reaction the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template dependent manner. The resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution and signal from the released reporter dye is free from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized and detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data.

TAQMAN PCR can be performed using commercially available equipment such as for example ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. USA or Lightcycler Roche Molecular Biochemicals Mannheim Germany . In a preferred embodiment the 5 nuclease procedure is run on a real time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. The system consists of a thermocycler laser charge coupled device CCD camera and computer. The system amplifies samples in a 96 well format on a thermocycler. During amplification laser induced fluorescent signal is collected in real time through fiber optics cables for all 96 wells and detected at the CCD. The system includes software for running the instrument and for analyzing the data.

5 Nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct or the threshold cycle. As discussed above fluorescence values are recorded during every cycle and represent the amount of product amplified to that point in the amplification reaction. The point when the fluorescent signal is first recorded as statistically significant is the threshold cycle Ct .

To minimize errors and the effect of sample to sample variation PCR is usually performed using an internal standard. The ideal internal standard is expressed at a constant level among different tissues and is unaffected by the experimental treatment. RNAs most frequently used to normalize patterns of gene expression are mRNAs for the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH and P actin.

A more recent variation of the PCR technique is quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR which measures PCR product accumulation through a dual labeled fluorigenic probe i.e. TAQMAN probe . Real time PCR is compatible both with quantitative competitive PCR where internal competitor for each target sequence is used for normalization and with quantitative comparative PCR using a normalization gene contained within the sample or a housekeeping gene for PCR. For further details see e.g. Held et al. 6 986 994 1996 .

The steps of a representative protocol for profiling gene expression using fixed paraffin embedded tissues as the RNA source including mRNA isolation purification primer extension and amplification are given in various published journal articles for example Godfrey et al. 2 84 91 2000 Specht et al. 158 419 29 2001 . Briefly a representative process starts with cutting about 10 microgram thick sections of paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples. The RNA is then extracted and protein and DNA are removed. After analysis of the RNA concentration RNA repair and or amplification steps may be included if necessary and RNA is reverse transcribed using gene specific promoters followed by PCR.

According to one aspect of the present invention PCR primers and probes are designed based upon intron sequences present in the gene to be amplified. In this embodiment the first step in the primer probe design is the delineation of intron sequences within the genes. This can be done by publicly available software such as the DNA BLAT software developed by Kent W. 12 4 656 64 2002 or by the BLAST software including its variations. Subsequent steps follow well established methods of PCR primer and probe design.

In order to avoid non specific signals it is important to mask repetitive sequences within the introns when designing the primers and probes. This can be easily accomplished by using the Repeat Masker program available on line through the Baylor College of Medicine which screens DNA sequences against a library of repetitive elements and returns a query sequence in which the repetitive elements are masked. The masked intron sequences can then be used to design primer and probe sequences using any commercially or otherwise publicly available primer probe design packages such as Primer Express Applied Biosystems MGB assay by design Applied Biosystems Primer3 Rozen and Skaletsky 2000 Primer3 on the WWW for general users and for biologist programmers. In Krawetz S Misener S eds . Humana Press Totowa N.J. pp 365 386 .

Factors considered in PCR primer design include primer length melting temperature Tm and G C content specificity complementary primer sequences and 3 end sequence. In general optimal PCR primers are generally 17 30 bases in length and contain about 20 80 such as for example about 50 60 G C bases. Tm s between 50 and 80 C. e.g. about 50 to 70 C. are typically preferred.

For further guidelines for PCR primer and probe design see e.g. Dieffenbach et al. General Concepts for PCR Primer Design in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 1995 pp. 133 155 Innis and Gelfand Optimization of PCRs in CRC Press London 1994 pp. 5 11 and Plasterer T. N. Primerselect Primer and probe design. 70 520 527 1997 the entire disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

The preferred conditions primers probes and internal reference G6PDH are as described in Example 1 below.

Differential gene expression can also be identified or confirmed using the microarray technique. Thus the expression profile of breast cancer associated genes can be measured in either fresh or paraffin embedded tumor tissue using microarray technology. In this method polynucleotide sequences of interest including cDNAs and oligonucleotides are plated or arrayed on a microchip substrate. The arrayed sequences are then hybridized with specific DNA probes from cells or tissues of interest. Just as in the PCR method the source of mRNA typically is total RNA isolated from human tumors or tumor cell lines and corresponding normal tissues or cell lines. Thus RNA can be isolated from a variety of primary tumors or tumor cell lines. If the source of mRNA is a primary tumor mRNA can be extracted for example from frozen or archived paraffin embedded and fixed e.g. formalin fixed tissue samples which are routinely prepared and preserved in everyday clinical practice.

In a specific embodiment of the microarray technique PCR amplified inserts of cDNA clones are applied to a substrate in a dense array. Preferably at least 10 000 nucleotide sequences are applied to the substrate. The microarrayed genes immobilized on the microchip at 10 000 elements each are suitable for hybridization under stringent conditions. Fluorescently labeled cDNA probes may be generated through incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides by reverse transcription of RNA extracted from tissues of interest. Labeled cDNA probes applied to the chip hybridize with specificity to each spot of DNA on the array. After stringent washing to remove non specifically bound probes the chip is scanned by confocal laser microscopy or by another detection method such as a CCD camera. Quantitation of hybridization of each arrayed element allows for assessment of corresponding mRNA abundance. With dual color fluorescence separately labeled cDNA probes generated from two sources of RNA are hybridized pairwise to the array. The relative abundance of the transcripts from the two sources corresponding to each specified gene is thus determined simultaneously. The miniaturized scale of the hybridization affords a convenient and rapid evaluation of the expression pattern for large numbers of genes. Such methods have been shown to have the sensitivity required to detect rare transcripts which are expressed at a few copies per cell and to reproducibly detect at least approximately two fold differences in the expression levels Schena et al. 93 2 106 149 1996 . Microarray analysis can be performed by commercially available equipment following manufacturer s protocols such as by using the Affymetrix GENCHIP technology or Incyte s microarray technology.

The development of microarray methods for large scale analysis of gene expression makes it possible to search systematically for molecular markers of cancer classification and outcome prediction in a variety of tumor types.

Serial analysis of gene expression SAGE is a method that allows the simultaneous and quantitative analysis of a large number of gene transcripts without the need of providing an individual hybridization probe for each transcript. First a short sequence tag about 10 14 bp is generated that contains sufficient information to uniquely identify a transcript provided that the tag is obtained from a unique position within each transcript. Then many transcripts are linked together to form long serial molecules that can be sequenced revealing the identity of the multiple tags simultaneously. The expression pattern of any population of transcripts can be quantitatively evaluated by determining the abundance of individual tags and identifying the gene corresponding to each tag. For more details see e.g. Velculescu et al. 270 484 487 1995 and Velculescu et al. 88 243 51 1997 .

The MassARRAY Sequenom San Diego Calif. technology is an automated high throughput method of gene expression analysis using mass spectrometry MS for detection. According to this method following the isolation of RNA reverse transcription and PCR amplification the cDNAs are subjected to primer extension. The cDNA derived primer extension products are purified and dipensed on a chip array that is pre loaded with the components needed for MALTI TOF MS sample preparation. The various cDNAs present in the reaction are quantitated by analyzing the peak areas in the mass spectrum obtained.

This method described by Brenner et al. 18 630 634 2000 is a sequencing approach that combines non gel based signature sequencing with in vitro cloning of millions of templates on separate 5 microgram diameter microbeads. First a microbead library of DNA templates is constructed by in vitro cloning. This is followed by the assembly of a planar array of the template containing microbeads in a flow cell at a high density typically greater than 3 106 microbeads cm2 . The free ends of the cloned templates on each microbead are analyzed simultaneously using a fluorescence based signature sequencing method that does not require DNA fragment separation. This method has been shown to simultaneously and accurately provide in a single operation hundreds of thousands of gene signature sequences from a yeast cDNA library.

Immunohistochemistry methods are also suitable for detecting the expression levels of the prognostic markers of the present invention. Thus antibodies or antisera preferably polyclonal antisera and most preferably monoclonal antibodies specific for each marker are used to detect expression. The antibodies can be detected by direct labeling of the antibodies themselves for example with radioactive labels fluorescent labels hapten labels such as biotin or an enzyme such as horse radish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Alternatively unlabeled primary antibody is used in conjunction with a labeled secondary antibody comprising antisera polyclonal antisera or a monoclonal antibody specific for the primary antibody. Immunohistochemistry protocols and kits are well known in the art and are commercially available.

The term proteome is defined as the totality of the proteins present in a sample e.g. tissue organism or cell culture at a certain point of time. Proteomics includes among other things study of the global changes of protein expression in a sample also referred to as expression proteomics . Proteomics typically includes the following steps 1 separation of individual proteins in a sample by 2 D gel electrophoresis 2 D PAGE 2 identification of the individual proteins recovered from the gel e.g. my mass spectrometry or N terminal sequencing and 3 analysis of the data using bioinformatics. Proteomics methods are valuable supplements to other methods of gene expression profiling and can be used alone or in combination with other methods to detect the products of the prognostic markers of the present invention.

The steps of a representative protocol for profiling gene expression using fixed paraffin embedded tissues as the RNA source including mRNA isolation purification primer extension and amplification are given in various published journal articles for example Godfrey et al. 2 84 91 2000 Specht et al. 158 419 29 2001 . Briefly a representative process starts with cutting about 10 microgram thick sections of paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples. The RNA is then extracted and protein and DNA are removed. After analysis of the RNA concentration RNA repair and or amplification steps may be included if necessary and RNA is reverse transcribed using gene specific promoters followed by PCR. Finally the data are analyzed to identify the best treatment option s available to the patient on the basis of the characteristic gene expression pattern identified in the tumor sample examined.

In one embodiment the patient treated herein aside from expressing HER3 at a certain level and or expressing HER2 HER3 at a certain level the patient further does not overexpress HER2. HER2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC e.g. using the HERCEPTEST Dako . Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a HER2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows 

Score 1 a faint barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10 of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.

Score 2 a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Score 3 a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1 scores for HER2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not overexpressing HER2 whereas those tumors with 2 or 3 scores may be characterized as overexpressing HER2.

Tumors overexpressing HER2 may be rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding to the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell and can been determined biochemically 

Overexpression of HER2 at the 3 level which leads to ligand independent activation of the tyrosine kinase Hudziak et A 84 7159 7163 1987 occurs in approximately 30 of breast cancers and in these patients relapse free survival and overall survival are diminished Slamon et al. 244 707 712 1989 Slamon et al. 235 177 182 1987 . Alternatively or additionally FISH assays such as the INFORM sold by Ventana Arizona or PATHVISION Vysis Illinois may be carried out on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent if any of HER2 amplification in the tumor.

HER3 and or HER2 expression may also be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay e.g. by administering a molecule such as an antibody which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Accordingly a method for manufacturing a HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor such as pertuzumab or a pharmaceutical composition thereof is provided which method comprises combining in a package the inhibitor or pharmaceutical composition and a label stating that the inhibitor or pharmaceutical composition is indicated for treating a patient with a type of cancer for example ovarian cancer which is able to respond to the inhibitor wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type and or if the patient s cancer sample expresses HER2 HER3 at a level which is greater than the 25percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in the cancer type.

In addition a method for manufacturing a chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine or a pharmaceutical composition thereof is provided wherein the method comprises combining in a package the chemotherapeutic agent or pharmaceutical composition and a label stating that the chemotherapeutic agent or pharmaceutical composition is indicated for treating a patient with a type of cancer exemplified by ovarian cancer wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level greater than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type.

The invention herein provides a method for treating a patient with a type cancer which is able to respond to a HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the inhibitor to the patient wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type and or if the cancer sample expresses HER2 HER3 at a level which is greater than the 25percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in the cancer type. Preferably the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level which is less than the 25percentile for HER3 expression in the cancer type and or expresses HER2 HER3 at a level which is greater than the median level most preferably greater than the 75percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in the cancer type.

In a particularly preferred embodiment the invention provides a method for treating a patient with ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of pertuzumab to the patient wherein the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level less than the median level for HER3 expression in ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer and or wherein the patient s cancer sample expresses HER2 HER3 at a level which is greater than the 25percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. In this embodiment preferably the patient s cancer expresses HER3 at a level which is less than the 25percentile for HER3 expression in ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer and or expresses HER2 HER3 at a level which is greater than the median level most preferably greater than the 75percentile for HER2 HER3 expression in ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

In another aspect the invention provides a method for selecting a therapy for a patient with a type of cancer which is able to respond to a chemotherapeutic agent comprising determining HER3 expression in a cancer sample from the patient and selecting a chemotherapeutic agent as the therapy if the cancer sample expresses HER3 at a level greater than the median level for HER3 expression in the cancer type. In this embodiment preferably the cancer type is ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer including platinum resistant ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer as well as advanced refractory and or recurrent ovarian cancer. The chemotherapeutic agent is preferably an antimetabolite such as gemcitabine. Thus in this embodiment high HER3 correlates with improved response to therapy with a chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine.

Examples of various cancer types that can be treated with a HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor are listed in the definition section above. Preferred cancer types include ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer breast cancer including metastatic breast cancer MBC lung cancer including non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. In one embodiment the cancer which is treated is advanced refractory recurrent chemotherapy resistant and or platinum resistant cancer.

Therapy with the HER inhibitor HER dimerization inhibitor and or chemotherapeutic agent preferably extends survival including progression free survival PFS and or overall survival OS . In one embodiment therapy with the HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor extends survival at least about 20 more than survival achieved by administering an approved anti tumor agent or standard of care for the cancer being treated.

In the preferred embodiment the method involves treating a patient with ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. The patient may have advanced refractory recurrent chemotherapy resistant and or platinum resistant ovarian peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Administration of pertuzumab to the patient may for example extend survival at least about 20 more than survival achieved by administering topotecan or liposomal doxorubicin to such a patient.

The HER inhibitor or HER dimerization inhibitor and or chemotherapeutic agent is administered to a human patient in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration e.g. as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular intraperitoneal intracerobrospinal subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. Intravenous administration of the antibody is preferred.

For the prevention or treatment of cancer the dose of HER inhibitor HER dimerization inhibitor and or chemotherapeutic agent will depend on the type of cancer to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the cancer whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the drug and the discretion of the attending physician.

In one embodiment a fixed dose of inhibitor is administered. The fixed dose may suitably be administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Where a fixed dose is administered preferably it is in the range from about 20 mg to about 2000 mg of the inhibitor. For example the fixed dose may be approximately 420 mg approximately 525 mg approximately 840 mg or approximately 1050 mg of the inhibitor such as pertuzumab.

Where a series of doses are administered these may for example be administered approximately every week approximately every 2 weeks approximately every 3 weeks or approximately every 4 weeks but preferably approximately every 3 weeks. The fixed doses may for example continue to be administered until disease progression adverse event or other time as determined by the physician. For example from about two three or four up to about 17 or more fixed doses may be administered.

In one embodiment one or more loading dose s of the antibody are administered followed by one or more maintenance dose s of the antibody. In another embodiment a plurality of the same dose are administered to the patient.

According to one preferred embodiment of the invention a fixed dose of HER dimerization inhibitor e.g. pertuzumab of approximately 840 mg loading dose is administered followed by one or more doses of approximately 420 mg maintenance dose s of the antibody. The maintenance doses are preferably administered about every 3 weeks for a total of at least two doses up to 17 or more doses.

According to another preferred embodiment of the invention one or more fixed dose s of approximately 1050 mg of the HER dimerization inhibitor e.g. pertzumab are administered for example every 3 weeks. According to this embodiment one two or more of the fixed doses are administered e.g. for up to one year 17 cycles and longer as desired.

In another embodiment a fixed dose of approximately 1050 mg of the HER dimerization inhibitor e.g. pertuzumab is administered as a loading dose followed by one or more maintenance dose s of approximately 525 mg. About one two or more maintenance doses may be administered to the patient every 3 weeks according to this embodiment.

While the HER inhibitor HER dimerization inhibitor or chemotherapeutic agent may be administered as a single anti tumor agent the patient is optionally treated with a combination of the inhibitor or chemotherapeutic agent and one or more additional chemotherapeutic agent s . Exemplary chemotherapeutic agents herein include gemcitabine carboplatin paclitaxel docetaxel topotecan and or liposomal doxorubicin. Preferably at least one of the chemotherapeutic agents is an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine. The combined administration includes coadministration or concurrent administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Thus the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent may be administered prior to or following administration of the inhibitor. In this embodiment the timing between at least one administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent and at least one administration of the inhibitor is preferably approximately 1 month or less and most preferably approximately 2 weeks or less. Alternatively the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent and the inhibitor are administered concurrently to the patient in a single formulation or separate formulations. Treatment with the combination of the chemotherapeutic agent e.g. antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine and the inhibitor e.g. pertuzumab may result in a synergistic or greater than additive therapeutic benefit to the patient.

Particularly desired chemotherapeutic agents for combining with the inhibitor e.g. for therapy of ovarian cancer include an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine a platinum compound such as carboplatin a taxoid such as paclitaxel or docetaxel topotecan or liposomal doxorubicin.

An antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent if administered is usually administered at dosages known therefor or optionally lowered due to combined action of the drugs or negative side effects attributable to administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Where the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent is gemcitabine preferably it is administered at a dose between about 600 mg mto 1250 mg m for example approximately 1000 mg m for instance on days 1 and 8 of a 3 week cycle.

Aside from the inhibitor and antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent other therapeutic regimens may be combined therewith. For example a second third fourth etc chemotherapeutic agent s may be administered wherein the second chemotherapeutic agent is either another different antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent or a chemotherapeutic agent that is not an antimetabolite. For example the second chemotherapeutic agent may be a taxane such as paclitaxel or docetaxel capecitabine or platinum based chemotherapeutic agent such as carboplatin cisplatin or oxaliplatin anthracycline such as doxorubicin including liposomal doxorubicin topotecan pemetrexed vinca alkaloid such as vinorelbine and TLK 286. Cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents may be administered.

Other therapeutic agents that may be combined with the inhibitor and or chemotherapeutic agent include any one or more of a second different HER inhibitor HER dimerization inhibitor for example a growth inhibitory HER2 antibody such as trastuzumab or a HER2 antibody which induces apoptosis of a HER2 overexpressing cell such as 7C2 7F3 or humanized variants thereof an antibody directed against a different tumor associated antigen such as EGFR HER3 HER4 anti hormonal compound e.g. an anti estrogen compound such as tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor a cardioprotectant to prevent or reduce any myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy a cytokine an EGFR targeted drug such as TARCEVAO IRESSA or cetuximab an anti angiogenic agent especially bevacizumab sold by Genentech under the trademark AVASTIN a tyrosine kinase inhibitor a COX inhibitor for instance a COX 1 or COX 2 inhibitor non steroidal anti inflammatory drug celecoxib CELEBREX farnesyl transferase inhibitor for example Tipifamib ZARNESTRA R115777 available from Johnson and Johnson or Lonafarnib SCH66336 available from Schering Plough antibody that binds oncofetal protein CA 125 such as Oregovomab MoAb B43.13 HER2 vaccine such as HER2AutoVac vaccine from Pharmexia or APC8024 protein vaccine from Dendreon or HER2 peptide vaccine from GSK Corixa another HER targeting therapy e.g. trastuzumab cetuximab ABX EGF EMD7200 gefitinib erlotinib CP724714 CI1033 GW572016 IMC 11F8 TAK165 etc Raf and or ras inhibitor see for example WO 2003 86467 doxorubicin HCl liposome injection DOXIL topoisomerase I inhibitor such as topotecan taxane HER2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as lapatinib GW572016 TLK286 TELCYTA EMD 7200 a medicament that treats nausea such as a serotonin antagonist steroid or benzodiazepine a medicament that prevents or treats skin rash or standard acne therapies including topical or oral antibiotic a medicament that treats or prevents diarrhea a body temperature reducing medicament such as acetaminophen diphenhydramine or meperidine hematopoietic growth factor etc.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the agent and inhibitor.

In addition to the above therapeutic regimes the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and or radiation therapy.

Where the inhibitor is an antibody preferably the administered antibody is a naked antibody. However the inhibitor administered may be conjugated with a cytotoxic agent. Preferably the conjugated inhibitor and or antigen to which it is bound is are internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the conjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include maytansinoids calicheamicins ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.

The present application contemplates administration of the inhibitor by gene therapy. See for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

There are two major approaches to getting the nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector into the patient s cells in vivo and ex vivo. For in vivo delivery the nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient usually at the site where the antibody is required. For ex vivo treatment the patient s cells are removed the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of the gene is a retrovirus.

The currently preferred in vivo nucleic acid transfer techniques include transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell a ligand for a receptor on the target cell etc. Where liposomes are employed proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and or to facilitate uptake e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling and proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half life. The technique of receptor mediated endocytosis is described for example by Wu et al. 262 4429 4432 1987 and Wagner et al. 87 3410 3414 1990 . For review of the currently known gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 . See also WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein.

Further details of the invention are illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. The disclosures of all citations in the specification are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

This example provides the results for a phase III clinical trial evaluating the safety tolerability and efficacy of pertuzumab in combination with gemcitabine in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer primary peritoneal carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma. Pertuzumab represents a new class of targeted agents called HER dimerization inhibitors HDIs that inhibit dimerization of HER2 with EGFR HER3 and HER4 and inhibit signaling through MAP and P13 kinase. Pertuzumab binds at the dimer dimer interaction site has a major effect on the role of HER2 as a co receptor prevents EGFR HER2 and HER3 HER2 dimerization and inhibits multiple HER mediated signaling pathways.

The effect of pertuzumab and gemcitabine on progression free survival PFS and overall survival OS was evaluated in all patients and in the subset of patients whose tumors contained markers that indicated activation of HER2. The study design schema is shown in .

Patients who had progressed while receiving or within 6 months of receiving a platinum based chemotherapy regimen were eligible for this study. Patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine in combination with pertuzumab or gemcitabine in combination with placebo. Patients treated herein included those who had not received a previous salvage regimen treatment for platinum resistant disease prior to study entry and those who had received one prior regimen for platinum resistant disease.

Gemcitabine was administered at 1000 mg mon days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle. Gemcitabine was infused first over 30 minutes. Dose reductions were permitted for toxicity. Placebo or pertuzumab was administered on day 1 of the 21 day cycle. Subjects randomized to receive pertuzumab were administered an initial loading dose of 840 mg Cycle 1 followed by 420 mg in Cycles 2 and beyond. Subjects randomized to receive placebo were administered placebo in the same volume as administered with pertuzumab arm for Cycle 1 Cycles 2 and beyond. Subjects without progressive disease received treatment for up to 17 cycles or 1 year. Patients had standard gemcitabine dose reduction and held doses as a result of cytopenias. Pertuzumab also was held for any held Day 1 gemcitabine doses. Subsequent doses were at the reduced doses and were not increased. If dose reduction or holding a dose was required in more than 4 occasions or if doses were held for more than 3 weeks then gemcitabine was discontinued and with the approval of the treating physician and medical monitor blinded drug was continued until disease progression. If Day 8 gemcitabine doses were held then the Day 8 dose was omitted and the subsequent treatment was commenced with the next cycle Day 22 of the previous cycle .

Subsequent doses for any patient requiring dose reduction were at the reduced dose. If doses were held for more than 3 weeks as a result of cytopenias patients were assumed to have unacceptable toxicity and discontinued gemcitabine. If there were no other additional grade III or IV toxicities continuation of blinded drug was at the discretion of the physician and medical monitor. Hematological toxicity of gemcitabine has been related to rate of dose administration. Gemcitabine was given over 30 minutes regardless of total dose. The use of colony stimulating agents for NCI CTC Grade 2 cytopenias were used at the discretion of the treating physician.

The option for crossover to single agent pertuzumab was offered. A loading dose of 840 mg was administered at the next cycle due with continuation of 420 mg with subsequent cycles every 21 days.

Response was assessed at the end of Cycles 2 4 6 8 12 and 17. Measurable disease was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors RECIST by clinical evaluation and CT scan or equivalent. Response for subjects with evaluable disease was assessed according to changes to CA 125 and clinical and radiologic evidence of disease. Responses were confirmed 4 8 weeks after the initial documentation of response. The following outcome measures were assessed.

Progression free survival as determined by investigator assessment using RECIST or CA 125 changes following initiation of assigned study treatment of all subjects in each arm.

Progression free survival as determined by investigator assessment using RECIST or CA 125 changes following initiation of assigned study treatment in each arm in the following subgroups 

To prevent or treat possible nausea and vomiting the patient was premedicated with serotonin antagonists steroids and or benzodiazepines. To prevent or treat possible rash standard acne therapies including topical and or oral antibiotics were used. Other possible concomitant medications were any prescription medications or over the counter preparations used by a subject in the interval beginning 7 days prior to Day 1 and continuing through the last day of the follow up period. Subjects who experienced infusion associated temperature elevations to 38.5 C. or other infusion associated symptoms were treated symptomatically with acetaminophen diphenhydramine or meperidine. Non experimental hematopoietic growth factors were administered for NCI CTC Grade 2 cytopenias.

Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue FFPET samples obtained from the patients in this clinical trial were analyzed for EGFR HER2 HER3 two HER ligands amphiregulin and betacellulin and G6PDH a housekeeping gene by qRT PCR. The qRT PCR assay was performed by TARGOS Molecular Pathology GmbH Kassel Germany using Roche Diagnostic s lab lot kits. The workflow and analysis for performing the qRT PCR assay on the clinical samples are depicted in herein.

mRNA analysis of EGFR HER2 HER3 amphiregulin and betacellulin was performed in duplicate. To allow quantitative data analysis G6PDH was also analyzed as an internal reference. Primer and probes were designed to amplify only mRNA not DNA. qRT PCR was conducted separately for each marker and G6PDH as a two step procedure.

In the first step cDNA was reverse transcribed from 5 l of total RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase and specific priming for each marker and G6PDH. Temperature profile was 10 min. 25 C. for annealing 60 min. 42 C. for reverse transcription and 5 min. 94 C. for enzyme inactivation.

In the second step a 100 120 bp fragment of marker and G6PDH mRNA was amplified from 5 l cDNA using the LIGHTCYCLER instrument Roche Applied Science Mannheim Germany . Amplicons were detected by fluorescence using specific pairs of labeled hybridization probes principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer . All reagents used for qRT PCR were from Roche Applied Science Mannheim Germany. Temperature profile was 10 min. 95 for initial denaturation and 45 cycles of 10 sec. 62 C. for annealing 9 sec. 72 C. for elongation 10 sec. 95 C. for denaturation . See table below for primer probe sequences used.

A calibrator RNA purified RNA from HT29 cell line was included in each run to allow for relative quantification positive and negative controls were used to check the workflow and reagents.

Data analysis was conducted using the LIGHTCYCLER Relative Quantification Software Roche Applied Science Mannheim Germany according to the manufacturer s instructions. The result was a calibrator normalized ratio of each marker for each patient sample.

qRT PCR values were available for 119 130 patients 92 . Dynamic range was EGFR about 10 fold HER2 about 10 fold HER3 about 20 fold. The principle of relative quantification was used. Gene expression mRNA level in a sample was quantified relatively referring to the expression of a housekeeping gene of the same sample reference G6PDH . This relative gene expression is then normalized to the relative gene expression in the calibratoer. For each marker a calibrator normalized ratio is calculated as below 

The efficacy results were assessed at 7.1 months median follow up range 1.3 20.3 . There were 101 progression free survival PFS events at that time. and B represent PFS in all patients treated with either gemcitabine and placebo or gemcitabine and pertuzumab. P values were estimated using stratified Cox model and stratified log rank test by randomization stratification factors ECOG PS number of prior regimens for platinum resistant disease and disease measurability .

PFS by predicted pHER2 status is shown in and B comparing PFS in patients predicted negative for pHER2 and those predicted positive for pHER2. A predictive algorithm was developed using 80 commercially obtained ovarian cancer samples. A combination of HER2 HER3 and amphiregulin expression predicts the 30 highest pHER samples with an accuracy of 80 . Patients were predicted positive for pHER2 if amphiregulin HER2 and HER3 were greater than and equal to the 70percentile others were considered negative for pHER2.

Preliminary data is available for overall survival OS . Such data for all patients are provided in and B. and B compare OS by HER3 qRT PCR comparing low HER3 expression less than 50percentile and high HER3 expression greater than or equal to the 50percentile .

The PFS results were further assessed with respect to HER2 HER3 ratio. The results of these further analyses are depicted in . As these figures show pertuzumab activity is greatest in patients with a high HER2 HER3 ratio.

Pertuzumab activity is greatest in patients with HER3 low expressing cancer and tends to increase as HER3 gene expression level decreases. Pertuzumab activity is also greatest in patients with high HER2 HER3 expressing cancer and tends to increase as HER2 HER3 gene expression level increases. Most patients with low HER3 expression level that responded to pertuzumab therapy also had a high HER2 HER3 ratio.

There may be a negative interaction between pertuzumab and gemcitabine in patient with HER3 high expressing tumors.

HER3 expression may be prognostic on the background of chemotherapy with high expressing tumors doing better.

This example concerns a single arm open label multicenter phase II clinical trial of ovarian cancer patients. Patients with advanced refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer were treated with pertuzumab a humanized HER2 antibody.

Patients with relapsed ovarian cancer were enrolled to receive therapy with low dose single agent pertuzumab pertuzumab was administered intravenously IV with a loading of 840 mg followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks.

A second cohort of patients was treated with high dose pertuzumab 1050 mg every 3 weeks administered as a single agent.

Tumor assessments were obtained after 2 4 6 8 12 and 16 cycles. Response Rate RR by RECIST was the primary endpoint. Safety and tolerability were additionally evaluated. Secondary endpoints were TTP duration of response duration of survival pharmacokinetics PK and FOSI cohort 2 .

qRT PCR assays were performed on archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Assay data is available for 46 117 patients. PFS and OS by HER3 qRT PCR with 25 75 selected as best split is shown in . Here high HER3 expressors were in the greater than and equal to 75percentile while low HER3 expressors were in the less than 75percentile.

Again patients with low HER3 expression treated with pertuzumab displayed better outcomes in terms of PFS and OS.

In this randomized open label Phase II clinical study the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab treatment in combination with carboplatin based standard chemotherapy was investigated in patients with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. The target sample size is 100 500 individuals. Target sample size is 148.

There may be a negative interaction between pertuzumab and gemcitabine in patient with HER3 high expressing tumors.

HER3 expression may be prognostic on the background of chemotherapy with high expressing tumors doing better.

A randomized phase II trial N 130 of pertuzumab gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine vs. placebo in patients with platinum resistant CDDP R epithelial ovarian cancer EOC suggested that pertuzumab could prolong PFS HR 0.66 95 CI 0.43 1.03 and that the duration of PFS may be associated with HER3 gene expression see Examples 2 and 3 .

Patients with CDDP R EOC were randomized to G P or G placebo. Treatment was given until progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was PFS. A secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy outcomes in patients with HER2 activation related expression profiles. A qRT PCR assay using archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue FFPET preformed as described above allowed mRNA expression analysis of HER pathway genes including HER1 HER2 HER3 amphiregulin and betacellulin. Outcomes were described by low gene expression 

Of the 5 biomarkers tested only HER3 gene expression suggested a patient subgroup with a differential PFS and OS outcome based upon low vs. high results. Final PFS and OS outcomes for all patients and by qRT PCR HER3 outcomes are as follows 

This exploratory analysis suggests that low tumor HER3 gene expression levels can be used prognostic indicators in patients with CDDP R EOC. Pertuzumab treatment may add to gemcitabine s clinical activity in patients whose tumors have low HER3 gene expression. These data suggest that HER3 mRNA expression levels may be used as a prognostic and predictive diagnostic biomarker.
