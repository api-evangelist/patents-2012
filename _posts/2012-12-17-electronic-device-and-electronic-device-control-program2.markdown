A remote conference system for holding a remote conference between parties located at remote locations via a communication network such as the Internet is becoming widespread.

In such a remote conference system a remote conference similar to an actual meeting may be held between two or more parties situated at remote locations by having a transmission terminal terminal apparatus located at a conference room of one party capture an image of the conference room and pick up sound such as voices generated at the conference room convert the acquired data into digital data and transmit the digital data to a transmission terminal located at a conference room of the other party. In turn the transmission terminal of the other party receiving the digital data may output the image data to a display display device located at the conference room of the other party and output the sound data to a speaker located at the conference room of the other party.

An electronic device embodying such a transmission terminal may be configured to display a menu UI User Interface on the display and execute operations based on commands input via the menu. In a case where the electronic device is used in different regions using different languages the electronic device is desirably configured to display the menu in the language used in the corresponding region.

Accordingly the electronic device has default language setting values set up beforehand according to its delivery destination and also includes a language selection menu for enabling a user to change the language setting.

However when the user is unable to read the default language the user may have trouble finding the language selection menu.

Accordingly Japanese Patent No. 3299003 discloses an electronic device that includes a language storage area and is configured to display the language selection menu when language information indicating the language to be used is not stored in the language storage area.

However the language setting menu of the electronic device particularly the language setting menu provided at initial startup operations of the electronic device typically requires the user to set up other setting items such as the format time zone and network information in addition to the language setting. When the user turns off the power of the electronic device after selecting a language but before setting up the other setting items the user has to start the setup operations all over again including the setup of the language setting when the electronic device is started another time.

It is a general object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide an electronic device that substantially obviates one or more problems caused by the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.

It is one object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to improve usability of an electronic device by relieving a user of the burden of having to set up a setting item the user has set up previously even if the power of the electronic device was turned off before completion of the previous setup operations.

The language table includes language information such as ja Japanese and en English and corresponding addresses of the UI providing system from which a UI may be obtained. The address may identify the UI providing system as well as the UI information in the corresponding language for example.

It is noted that in the case where the transmission terminal stores the UI information internally the language determining unit and the UI designating unit may be unnecessary.

As is shown in the UI providing system includes a transmission reception unit and UI information . The transmission reception unit exchanges information with the transmission terminal and when the transmission reception unit receives a UI information request from the transmission terminal to obtain UI information the transmission reception unit obtains the UI information in the corresponding language from the UI information and transmits the obtained UI information to the transmission terminal that has made the UI information request.

In the following operations of the transmission system are described with reference to . is a sequence chart showing exemplary process steps for managing status information indicating the operation status of the relay apparatus at the transmission management system . is a sequence chart showing exemplary process steps performed in preparation for starting communication between plural transmission terminals . is a sequence chart showing exemplary process steps for restricting the relay apparatuses to select one relay apparatus . is a sequence chart showing exemplary process steps of the transmission terminal for selecting the relay apparatus . is a sequence chart showing exemplary process steps for exchanging image data and sound data between the transmission terminals .

First exemplary process steps for managing status information indicating the operation status of the relay apparatus at the transmission management system are described with reference to .

In the illustrated example shown in at each of the relay apparatuses also referred to as relay apparatus hereinafter the status detecting unit see periodically detects the operation status of its own apparatus S to S . Then in order to enable the transmission management system to manage the operation status of the relay apparatus in real time the transmission reception unit of the relay apparatus periodically transmits status information to the transmission management system via the communication network S to S . The status information includes the relay apparatus ID of the relay apparatus and the operation status of the relay apparatus detected by the status detecting unit . In the example described below it is assumed that the relay apparatuses and are operating normally so that their operation statuses are indicated as online whereas the relay apparatus is operating but is indicated as offline due to some problems occurring in the program for executing relay operations at the relay apparatus

Next at the transmission management system the transmission reception unit receives the status information transmitted from the relay apparatus and stores the status information in association with the corresponding relay apparatus ID in the relay apparatus management table see of the storage unit via the read write processing unit S to S . In this way the status information indicating the operation status of the relay apparatus as online offline or failure may be stored in association with the corresponding relay apparatus ID in the relay apparatus management table see . Also the received date time at which the status information was received by the transmission management system is stored in association with the corresponding relay apparatus ID. It is noted that in a case where the status information is not transmitted from the relay apparatus the operation status field and the received data time field of the record for the corresponding relay apparatus included in the relay apparatus management table shown in may be left blank or the operation status and the received date time received on a previous occasion may be indicated.

In the following exemplary process steps in preparation for starting communication between the transmission terminal and the transmission terminal are described with reference to .

At the transmission terminal when a user turns on the power switch see the operation input accepting unit see accepts the user input as a power on command input and turns on the power of the transmission terminal step S .

When the power of the transmission terminal is turned on the startup processing unit see performs startup operations S which is described below with reference to .

Then the login request unit automatically transmits login request information indicating a login request from the transmission reception unit to the transmission management system via the communication network S . The login request information includes the terminal ID and password of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A. The terminal ID and the password correspond to data that are read from the storage unit via the read write processing unit and transmitted to the transmission reception unit . It is noted that when the transmission terminal transmits the login request information to the transmission management system the transmission management system receiving the login request information is able to determine the IP address of the transmission terminal that is transmitting the login request information. Also it is noted that language information indicting the language designated by the language designating unit in the startup operations obtained from the storage unit is transmitted to the transmission management system along with the login request information.

Then the terminal authentication unit of the transmission management system performs terminal authentication by searching the terminal authentication management table see of the storage unit using the terminal ID and the password included in the login request information received via the transmission reception unit as search keys and determining whether the same terminal ID and password are stored in the terminal authentication management DB S . If the terminal authentication unit determines that the same terminal ID and password are stored in the terminal authentication management DB so that the login request received from the transmission terminal is a legitimate login request from a terminal with proper authorization the status management unit stores the terminal ID of the transmission terminal in association with its operations status the received date time at which the login request information was received by the transmission management system and the IP address of the transmission terminal in the terminal management table see S . In this way the transmission ID 01aa of the transmission terminal may be stored in association with the operation status online the received date time 2009.11.10.13 40 and the IP address 1.2.1.3 in the terminal management table shown in for example.

Also the language determining unit of the transmission management system determines recognizes the designated language from the language information that is transmitted from the transmission terminal along with the login request information S . The UI designating unit refers to the language table see and obtains UI resource information corresponding to the language information S .

Then the transmission reception unit of the transmission management system transmits authentication result information indicating the authentication result obtained by the terminal authentication unit and the UI resource information obtained by the UI designating unit to the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A via the communication network S . In the example described below it is assumed that the terminal authentication unit determines that the transmission terminal is a terminal with proper authorization.

Upon receiving the authentication result information and the UI resource information the transmission terminal sends a request to the UI providing system according to the UI resource information to obtain UI information S . When the transmission reception unit of the UI providing system receives the request from the transmission terminal the transmission reception unit obtains the UI information in the corresponding language from the UI information and transmits the obtained UI information to the transmission terminal S .

Meanwhile the terminal extracting unit of the transmission management system searches the destination list management table see using the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A that has made the login request as a search key and extracts reads the terminal IDs of the destination terminal B candidates that are capable of establishing communication with the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A S . In the case of using the destination list management table shown in the terminal IDs 01ab 01ba and 01db of the transmission terminals and that are stored in association with the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal may be extracted.

Then the terminal status obtaining unit searches the terminal management table see using the terminal IDs 01ab 01ba and 01db of the destination terminal B candidates extracted by the terminal extracting unit as search keys and obtains the status information of each of the corresponding transmission terminals and by reading the operation status stored in association with each of the terminal IDs offline online and online in S .

Then the transmission reception unit transmits destination status information including the terminal IDs used as search keys in step S 01ab 01ba and 01db and the operation statuses of the corresponding transmission terminals and offline online and online to the transmission terminal via the communication network S . In this way the transmission terminal as the requesting terminal A obtains information on the current operation statuses offline online and online of the transmission terminals and corresponding to destination terminal B candidates that are capable of establishing communication with the transmission terminal . Then the transmission terminal displays a menu UI based on the UI information obtained from the UI providing system in step S S . shows an exemplary Japanese menu displayed based on Japanese UI information. shows an exemplary English menu displayed based on English UI information.

Also the terminal extracting unit of the transmission management system searches the destination list management table see using the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A as a search key and extracts the terminal IDs of transmission terminals that have the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal registered as a destination terminal B candidate S . In the destination list management table shown in the records for the terminal IDs 01ab 01ba and 01db include the terminal ID 01aa as a destination terminal B candidate so that these terminal IDs are extracted in step S.

Then the terminal status obtaining unit of the transmission management system searches the terminal management table see using the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal as a search key and obtains the operation status of the transmission terminal S .

Then of the transmission terminals and with the terminal IDs 01ab 01ba and 01db extracted in step S the transmission reception unit transmits requesting terminal status information to the transmission terminals and whose operation statuses are indicated as online in the terminal management table see S S . The requesting terminal status information includes the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal and its operation status online obtained in step S. It is noted that when transmitting the requesting terminal status information to the transmission terminals and the transmission reception unit refers to the terminal management table see to find the IP addresses of the transmission terminals and based on the their terminal IDs 01ba and 01db. In this way the requesting terminal status information indicating the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A and its operation status online may be transmitted to the transmission terminals and corresponding to destination terminal B candidates that are capable of establishing communication with the transmission terminal

Further it is noted that when the user turns on the power switch see of another transmission terminal in a manner similar to step S the operation input accepting unit see of that transmission terminal accepts the user input as a power on command and process steps similar to steps S through S S described above may be performed.

In the following exemplary startup operations of the transmission terminal step S of are described in detail with reference to .

When startup operations of the transmission terminal are started the startup processing unit obtains language information and setting status information from the storage unit S S and determines the next process step to be performed according to the value of the setting status information obtained in step S S . In the present example it is assumed that the startup operations are performed based on the setting status information as defined in .

When the value of the setting status information is 0 the startup processing unit loads a program for the UI setting unit to configure a language setting UI S and prompts the user to specify a language via the language setting UI provided by the setting UI unit S .

When the language setting is completed the startup processing unit stores the language setting information indicating the language specified by the user in the storage unit and sets the value of the setting status information equal to 1 S .

Then the startup processing unit loads a program for the UI setting unit to configure a format time zone setting UI S and prompts the user to specify a format time zone via the format time zone UI provided by the setting UI unit S .

When the format time zone setting is completed the startup processing unit stores the format time zone setting information indicating the format time zone specified by the user in the storage unit and sets the value of the setting status information equal to 2 S .

Then the startup processing unit loads a program for the setting UI unit to configure a network setting UI S and prompts the user to specify network settings via the network setting UI provided by the setting UI unit S .

When the network setting is completed the startup processing unit stores the network setting information indicating the network specified by the user in the storage unit and sets the value of the setting status information equal to 4 S . Then the startup processing unit ends the startup operations.

When the value of the setting status information obtained in step S is 1 steps S are skipped and the process is started from step S.

When the value of the setting status information obtained in step S is 2 steps S are skipped and the process is started from step S.

When the value of the setting status information obtained in step S is 3 the startup processing unit sets the value of the setting status information stored in the storage unit equal to 4 and ends the startup operations.

When the value of the setting status information obtained in step S is 4 the startup processing unit simply ends the startup operations without performing any particular process.

By performing the above process steps setting items that have been set up may be saved and the user may not have to set up the setting items once more when the power is turned off before completion of the setup operations. In this way usability of the transmission terminal may be improved for example.

In the following exemplary process steps for selecting the relay apparatus to be used are described with reference to . According to the destination status information received by the transmission terminal in step S indicating that the operation statuses of the transmission terminals and are online the transmission terminal may establish communication with at least one of transmission terminal or . In the example described below it is assumed that the user of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A has chosen to establish communication with the transmission terminal as the destination terminal B.

When the user presses the operation button see to select the transmission terminal the operation input accepting unit see accepts the user input as a request to start communication with the transmission terminal S . Then the transmission reception unit of the transmission terminal transmits start request information including a communication start request the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal and the terminal ID 01db of the transmission terminal to the transmission management system S . In this way the transmission reception unit of the transmission management system may receive the start request information and determine the IP address 1.2.1.3 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the sender of the start request information. Then based on the terminals IDs 01aa and 01db of the terminal apparatuses and included in the start request information the status management unit changes the information indicated in the operation status fields of the records for the terminals IDs 01aa and 01db included in the terminal management table see to communicating S . It is noted that the operation status communicating indicates that although the transmission terminals and have not yet started communication with each other their communication lines are currently in use so that when other transmission terminals attempt to establish communication with the transmission terminal or a so called busy tone or display will be output.

In the following exemplary process steps for executing a session for selecting the relay apparatus are described with reference to steps S and steps S of . In the present example first a selection session ID sel used for executing a session for selecting the relay apparatus is generated S . Then the session management unit stores the selection session ID sel generated in step S in association with the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A and the terminal ID 01db of the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B in the session management table see of the storage unit S .

Then the restriction unit of the transmission management system performs a first restriction process for restricting the relay apparatuses to be selected for use in establishing communication between the transmission terminals and based on the relay apparatus management DB the terminal management DB and the priority management DB S .

When the restriction process of step S is completed the transmission reception unit see transmits relay apparatus restriction information indicating the number of relay apparatuses remaining after the restriction process to the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B via the communication network S . In the present example the relay apparatus restriction information includes the number 2 as the number of relay apparatuses remaining after the restriction process the terminal ID 01aa of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A and the selection session ID sel. In this way the transmission terminal may be notified of the number of relay apparatuses and the requesting terminal A seeking to establish communication with the transmission terminal in the relay apparatus selection session identified by the selection session ID sel. Also the transmission terminal may determine the IP address 1.1.1.2 of the transmission management system corresponding to the sender of the relay apparatus restriction information.

Then the transmission terminal transmits from the transmission reception unit reception completion information indicating that reception of the relay apparatus restriction information has been completed to the transmission management system via the communication network S . The reception completion information includes the session ID sel. In this way the transmission management system may be notified of the completion of the transmission of the relay apparatus restriction information of the relay apparatus selection session identified by the selection session ID sel and may determine the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the sender of the reception completion information.

In the following exemplary process steps performed by the transmission terminal for selecting the relay apparatus to be used are described with reference to . First before starting the television conference the transmission management system transmits pre relay request information to each of the relay apparatuses and corresponding to the relay apparatuses remaining after the restriction process performed in step S S and S . The pre relay request information includes the selection session ID sel the IP address of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A and the IP address of the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B. In this way the relay apparatuses and may determine the selection session ID of the session the terminal ID of the requesting terminal A and the terminal ID of the destination terminal B. The relay apparatuses and may also determine the IP address 1.1.1.2 of the transmission management system .

Then at each of the relay apparatuses and the transmission reception unit transmits pre transmission request information to the transmission terminal identified as the requesting terminal A in steps S and S S and S . The pre transmission request information indicates a request to have pre transmission information including a ping Packet Internet Groper transmitted from the transmission terminal before starting the television conference and includes the selection session ID sel. In this way the transmission terminal may be notified of the transmission request for the pre transmission information from the relay apparatuses and and may also determine the IP addresses 1.2.1.2 and 1.2.2.2 of the relay apparatuses and during the relay apparatus selection process executed in the session identified by the selection session ID sel. 

It is noted that in the present example the transmission management system does not communicate the IP address of the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B to the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A. Instead the transmission management system communicates the IP address of the transmission terminal to the relay apparatuses and S and S and the relay apparatuses and each send pre transmission request information to the transmission terminal requesting pre transmission information from the transmission terminal S and S . That is in the present example the IP addresses of the transmission terminals are not revealed to the other transmission terminals so that security may be ensured for example.

Then the transmission terminal transmits pre transmission information to the relay apparatuses and from the transmission reception unit via the communication network S and S . The transmission terminal transmits the pre transmission information to the transmission terminal via the relay apparatuses and before actually transmitting image data and or sound data. The pre transmission information is used to measure the time it takes for the transmission terminal to receive information transmitted from the transmission terminal . The pre transmission information includes a ping for confirming that the transmission terminal the relay apparatuses and and the transmission terminal are connected so that they may establish communication with each other the transmission date time at which the pre transmission information was transmitted from the transmission terminal and the selection session ID sel. In this way the relay apparatuses and may determine that the pre transmission information has been transmitted and the IP address 1.2.1.3 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A during execution of the session identified by the selection session ID sel. 

Then using the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal included in the pre relay request information received from the transmission management system in steps and S the relay apparatuses and transmits the pre transmission information received from the transmission terminal to the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal S and S . In this way the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B may be notified of the pre transmission information and determine the IP address 1.2.1.2 or 1.2.2.2 of the relay apparatuses or corresponding to the sender of the pre transmission information during execution of the session identified by the selection session ID sel. 

Then based on the pre transmission information from the relay apparatuses and the selection processing unit of the transmission terminal selects one of the relay apparatuses or that is to be used for transmitting relaying image data and sound data to and from the transmission terminals and in the television conference S .

It is noted that in the present example the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B selects the relay apparatus as the relay apparatus to be used in the television conference between the transmission terminals and . However in other examples the transmission terminal may transmit time information indicating the time it took for the transmission terminal to receive the pre transmission information transmitted from the transmission terminal to the transmission management system or the transmission terminal so that the transmission management system or the transmission terminal may perform the relay apparatus selection process.

Then the transmission reception unit of the transmission terminal transmits selection information indicating that the relay apparatus has been selected to the transmission management system via the communication network S . The selection information includes the selection session ID sel and the relay apparatus ID 111a of the selected relay apparatus . In this way the transmission management system may be notified of the selection of the relay apparatus and determine the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the sender of the selection information during execution of the session identified by the selection session ID sel. 

Then the session management unit of the transmission management system stores the relay apparatus ID 111a of the selected relay apparatus in the relay apparatus ID field of the record for the selection session ID sel included in the session management table see of the session management DB S and the transmission reception unit transmits the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B to the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A S . Then the transmission reception unit of the transmission management system transmits relay start request information indicating a request to start relaying operations to the relay apparatus via the communication network S . The relay start request information includes the IP addresses 1.2.1.3 and 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A and the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B. In turn the relay apparatus establishes a session for transmitting image data low resolution image data medium resolution image data and or high resolution image data and sound data to and from the transmission terminals and S . In this way the transmission terminals and may start the television conference.

It is noted that in the above example the transmission management system transmits the relay apparatus restriction information to the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B in step S and after steps S S and S are performed the transmission terminal performs the relay apparatus selection process in step S. However in other examples the transmission management system may transmit the relay apparatus restriction information to the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A in step S in which case the roles of the transmission terminals and as the sender and receiver of information are switched from the above example in the ensuing process steps up to steps S and S . In this case the transmission terminal may perform the relay apparatus selection process of step S instead of the transmission terminal and transmit the selection information to the transmission management system in step S.

In the following exemplary process steps for exchanging image data and sound data during the television conference between the transmission terminals and are described with reference to . First the transmission reception unit of the transmission terminal corresponding to the requesting terminal A transmits image data of an imaging object captured by the imaging unit and sound data of sound input to the sound input unit to the relay apparatus via the communication network S . In the present example high quality image data including image data of the low resolution image medium resolution image and the high resolution image shown in and sound data are transmitted to the relay apparatus . In this way the transmission reception unit of the relay apparatus receives the image data in three different resolution levels and the sound data. Then the data quality confirming unit confirms the image quality of the image data to be transmitted by searching the quality change management table see using the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal as a search key and extracting the corresponding image quality of image data to be transmitted S . In the present example the data quality confirming unit confirms that image data of high quality is to be transmitted which quality is the same as that of the image data received by the transmission reception unit . Thus the image data of the same quality and the sound data of the same quality as those received by the transmission reception unit are transmitted to the transmission terminal S . In this way the transmission reception unit of the transmission terminal corresponding to the destination terminal B may receive the image data and sound data the image display control unit may display an image at the display based on the image data and the sound output unit may output sound based on the sound data.

Then the delay detecting unit of the transmission terminal detects the delay time of the image data reception by the transmission reception unit at intervals of a predetermined time period e.g. every second S . In the example described below it is assumed that a delay time of 200 ms is detected by the delay time detecting unit .

The transmission reception unit of the transmission terminal transmits delay information indicating the delay time of 200 ms to the transmission management system via the communication network S . In this way the transmission management system may determine the image data reception delay time and the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the sender of the delay information.

Then the delay time management unit of the transmission management system searches the terminal management table see using the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal as a search key to extract the terminal ID 01db of the transmission terminal and stores the delay time 200 ms indicated by the delay information in the delay time field of the record for the extracted terminal ID 01db included in the session management table see of the session management DB S .

Then the quality determining unit searches the quality management table see using the delay time 200 ms as a search key to extract the corresponding image quality medium quality and determines the image quality of image data to be transmitted as medium quality S .

Then the transmission reception unit searches the relay apparatus management table see using the relay apparatus ID 111a associated with the terminal ID 01db in the session management table see as a search key to extract the IP address 1.2.1.2 of the corresponding relay apparatus S . Then the transmission reception unit transmits quality information indicating medium quality as the image quality of image data to be transmitted as determined in step S to the relay apparatus via the communication network S . The quality information includes the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal that was used as the search key in step S. In turn the quality change management unit of the relay apparatus stores the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal corresponding to the transmission destination in association with the image quality medium quality of the image data to be transmitted relayed in the quality change management table see S .

Then the transmission terminal transmits high quality image data including image data of a high resolution image a medium resolution image and a low resolution image and sound data to the relay apparatus in a manner similar to step S S . In turn the data quality confirming unit of the relay apparatus confirms the image quality of the image data to be transmitted by searching the quality change management table see using the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal as a search key and extracting the corresponding image quality medium quality of image data to be transmitted in a manner similar to step S S . Since the quality management table has been updated by the quality change management unit in step S to indicate medium quality as the corresponding image quality for the IP address 1.3.2.4 of the transmission terminal the data quality confirming unit confirms that image data of medium quality is to be transmitted which quality is lower than the high quality image data received by the transmission reception unit . Thus the data quality change unit changes the quality of the image data to be transmitted by degrading the quality from high quality to medium quality S . Then the transmission reception unit transmits the image data that has been changed from high quality to medium quality and sound data that is left unchanged to the transmission terminal via the communication network S . As can be appreciated from above in the present example when a delay occurs in the reception of image data at the transmission terminal the relay apparatus changes the image quality of the image data to be transmitted so that awkwardness would not be felt by the participants of the television conference.

In one embodiment a mirror driver may be used to perform a process of obtaining display data. The mirror driver enables direct transmission of display data to a USB driver without running a program. In such an embodiment the mirror driver generates the display data and the USB driver transmits the generated display data to the transmission terminal via the external device connection I F . In this case a program for obtaining the display data may not be necessary so that resources for running a program may be conserved for example.

It is noted that in the example described above a program for obtaining image data generated by a display driver and transmitting the generated image data to the transmission terminal is used. However in another embodiment a program for obtaining a drawing command generated by a GDI Graphics Design Interface and transmitting the drawing command to the transmission terminal may be used. In such an embodiment network resources may be conserved since the data volume of a drawing command is smaller than that of image data.

It is also noted that the transmission management system the program providing system and the maintenance system may be realized by a single computer or the functional units of the above systems may be divided and allocated to multiple computers. In a case where the program providing system is realized by a single computer a program transmitted by the program providing system may be divided into plural modules or the program may be transmitted as a whole without being divided. In a case where the program providing system is realized by multiple computers the program may be divided into plural modules and transmitted by the computers realizing the program providing system .

It is also noted that the recording medium storing the transmission terminal program the relay apparatus program and the transmission management program the HD storing the above programs and the program providing system including the HD may embody computer program products that are used to provide the transmission terminal program the relay apparatus program and or the transmission management program to users both within and outside the country for example.

It is also noted that in the example described above the quality change management table shown in and the quality management table shown in are configured to manage the image resolution of the image data to be transmitted by the relay apparatus . However the present invention is not limited to such an example and in other examples the data quality management may be based on other data properties such as the image depth of image data the sampling frequency of sound data and or the bit length of sound data for example.

Also although the relay apparatus management table shown in the terminal management table shown in and the session management table shown in are configured to manage the received time date in the example described above the present invention is not limited to such an example and in other examples only the received time may be stored and managed.

Further although the relay apparatus management table shown in is configured to manage the IP addresses of the relay apparatuses and the terminal management table shown in is configured to manage the IP addresses of the transmission terminals in the example described above the present invention is not limited to such an example so long as relay apparatus specific information for identifying the relay apparatus on the communication network and terminal specific information for identifying the transmission terminal on the communication network are managed. For example the FQDN Fully Qualified Domain Name of each of the relay apparatuses and the transmission terminals may be managed instead of the IP address. In this case an IP address corresponding to a FQDN may be obtained by a conventional DNS Domain Name System server. It is noted that the relay apparatus specific information for identifying the relay apparatus on the communication network described above may alternatively be referred to as relay apparatus connection information indicating the connection destination of the relay apparatus on the communication network or relay apparatus destination information indicating the destination of the relay apparatus on the communication network for example. Similarly the terminal specific information for identifying the transmission terminal on the communication network described above may alternatively be referred to as terminal connection information indicating the connection destination of the transmission terminal on the communication network or terminal destination information indicating the destination of the transmission terminal on the communication network for example.

It is also noted that although a television conference system is described as an exemplary embodiment of the transmission system the present invention is not limited to such an example. In other embodiments the transmission system may be a phone system such as an IP Internet Protocol phone system or an Internet phone system for example. In yet another embodiment the transmission system may be a car navigation system. In this case at least one of the relay apparatuses may be a car navigation device installed in a vehicle and another one of the relay apparatuses may be a management terminal or a management server of a management center that manages car navigation for example.

Further the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and numerous variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
