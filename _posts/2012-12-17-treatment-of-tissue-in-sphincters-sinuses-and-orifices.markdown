This invention relates to treatment of tissue particularly in the sphincters esophagus sinuses and other internal body orifices and structures. Such treatment can be performed using ablation coating expansion plumping shaping shrinking or related techniques.

Human beings are subject to a number of disorders in the sphincters sinuses esophagus and other internal orifices. Disorders in the rectum and colon include hemorrhoids external and internal fecal incontinence prolapsed rectal muscles rectal muscle spasms anal fissures polyps diverticulosus diverticulitus and pilonital cysts. Other internal disorders in nearby regions of the male body include prostate cancer blockage of the urethra and incontinence. Other internal disorders in nearby regions of the female body include incontinence vaginal bleeding vaginal cysts vaginal fibroids prolapsed uterus and related tumors or cancerous tissue. Disorders of the pharynx include tumors and polyps in the hypopharynx oropharynx and nasopharynx. Disorders in adjacent structures include Barrett s esophagus laryngeal tumors and laryngeal polyps.

Known methods for the treatment of these disorders include surgery pharmaceutical remedies chemotherapeutic regimens radiation photodynamic therapy and lifestyle modification. These methods only occasionally achieve the goal of successful treatment of disorders in orifices sphincters esophagus and sinuses. Moreover these methods suffer from several drawbacks.

Drawbacks to surgical treatment include its highly invasive nature associated risks possible iatrogenic effects and high cost. Drawbacks to pharmaceutical and chemotherapeutic treatments include their relative ineffectiveness particularly in the oral cavity and adjacent respiratory structures and associated side effects. Moreover these approaches are contraindicated for many patients. Drawbacks to lifestyle modification include relatively poor patient compliance and relative ineffectiveness. Drawbacks to photodynamic therapy include its frequent unavailability and limited applicability. Drawbacks to radiation include side effects such as exhaustion radiation burns chronic dry mouth and permanent distortion of the taste buds. Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide techniques for treatment of these disorders that are not subject to these known drawbacks.

The use of radio frequency RF to ablate tissue in the body such as heart muscle is known in the art of cardiac treatment. However known systems using RF energy are sill subject to several drawbacks. One known problem is that it can be difficult to block the flow of bodily fluids and gases into an area of the body where tissue ablation is taking place. Bodily fluids can dissipate and detrimentally absorb the energy to be applied to the tissue to be ablated. Dissipation of bodily fluids detracts from the goal of successful tissue ablation and etching.

A second known problem in the art involves directing and positioning the electrodes in the body cavity or orifice. Difficulties in accurately positioning the electrodes in the target orifice detract from treatment. Frequently unhealthy tissue can remain unablated while healthy tissue is removed. Difficulties in directing and positioning the electrodes are particularly problematic because one of the goals of treatment is to minimize collateral damage to healthy tissue and to completely ablate diseased tissue.

A third known problem in the art involves difficulty in the simultaneous use of complimentary technology. Known systems do not provide for optimal simultaneous use of auxiliary tools for visualization feedback technology and drug administration.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide improved techniques for treatment of disorders in the esophagus sphincters sinuses and other internal body orifices. For example it would be advantageous to provide devices bearing different arrays of curvilinear electrodes that can be retracted or extended into the target tissue that can also support apparatus for drug administration and tissue visualization. Such devices would allow medical personnel to 1 visualize the tissue to be ablated or etched 2 seal off the area from fluids and gases that would disturb the area to be ablated 3 ablate all diseased tissue while sparing healthy tissue and 4 provide for the localized administration of drugs to numb the area and treat the disorder. These advantages are achieved in an embodiment of the invention in which medical personnel use a catheter bearing multiple controls for visualization and drug administration balloon like air sacs for sealing the area and multiple arrays of curvilinear electrodes that can be extended and retracted as needed.

The invention provides a method and system for treatment of body structures or tissue. The particular treatment can include one or more of or some combination of ablation coating expansion plumping shaping shrinking or related techniques. The particular body structures or tissue can include one or more of or some combination of regions including a sphincter sinus or orifice such as the rectum colon esophagus vagina penis larynx or pharynx.

In one aspect of the invention an environment proximate to or surrounding the targeted treatment region can be isolated or controlled by blocking the flow of gases or liquids using an inflatable balloon positioned immediately adjacent to the tissue that is to be ablated. The inflatable balloon can also serve to anchor the catheter in place and prevent the catheter from being expelled from the body. The inflatable balloon can also insure that locally administered drugs remain in the area where most needed.

In a second aspect of the invention positive pressure is used to inflate the balloon. Inflation of the balloon triggers the extension of at least one curvilinear electrode into the targeted tissue. Negative pressure deflates the air sac and helps retract the curvilinear electrodes so as to allow the catheter to be removed from the body without damaging adjacent body structures. Alternately the electrode s can be extended or retracted from the tissue independently from the act of inflation or deflation of the balloon.

In a third aspect of the invention the electrodes are coupled to sensors that measure properties of the target region such as temperature and impedance. Measurement of these properties permits the use of feedback technique to control delivery of the RF energy and administration of fluids for cooling and hydrating the affected tissues. The electrodes can also be coupled to radio opaque markers to aid in fluoroscopic positioning.

In a fourth aspect of the invention the catheter includes an optical path that can be coupled to external viewing apparatus. In this way the position of the electrodes in the body can be determined using fiber optic techniques. The external viewing apparatus can also be coupled to an ultrasound probe included in the catheter.

A catheter and electrode assembly for treating tissue includes a catheter an expandable cage structure and a control and delivery linkage .

The catheter includes a distal segment and a proximal segment . The distal segment includes a tapered tip for easy insertion into an orifice. The tapered tip may be either flexible or rigid depending upon the orifice into which the catheter is to be inserted. The overall length of the shaft of the catheter including the expandable cage structure from the tapered tip to the junction where the catheter is coupled to the control and delivery linkage is about 65 centimeters. The diameter of the catheter is about 0.4 centimeters. In an alternative embodiment the length and diameter of the shaft of the catheter may vary substantially depending upon the application.

The catheter includes an expandable cage structure . The cage structure includes a set of struts a set of curvilinear electrodes and an inflatable balloon .

One end of each one of the struts is coupled to the distal segment of the catheter the opposite end of each one of the set of struts is coupled to the proximal segment of the catheter. Taken together the distal segment the cage structure and the proximal segment are linearly contiguous and form one continuous unit. The inflatable balloon is surrounded by the set of struts .

The set of curvilinear electrodes is embedded in the set of struts . The electrodes each include a metallic tube defining a hollow lumen shaped similarly to a curvilinear needle and a sensor . In addition to ablating tissue by delivering RF energy the electrodes are disposed to deliver at least one flowable substance to the area of the body where ablation is to take place. In a preferred embodiment the flowable substance includes saline with a concentration of less than about 10 NaCl which aids in hydration of body structures. However in alternative embodiments the deliverable flowable liquids includes other substances including anesthetic drugs anti inflammatory agents chemotherapeutic agents systemic or topical antibodies collagen and radioactive substances such as labeled tracers.

Exact positioning of the electrodes is achieved by inflating the balloon . Inflation of the balloon causes expansion of the expandable cage structure allowing one or more of the set of electrodes to be extended directly into the targeted tissue.

The assembly is operated by manipulating the control and delivery linkage . The control and delivery linkage includes a port two female couplings and a mechanical switch and a hand set .

The port can be coupled to both a RF source and a visualization apparatus such as fiber optic devices or fluoroscopy equipment to allow internal viewing of the orifice. The two female couplings and can be coupled to a syringe or other device to which positive pressure can be applied to inflate the balloon . In a preferred embodiment one or more of the female couplings and can also be coupled to drug administration apparatus. Manipulation of the mechanical switch causes the extension of the electrodes . The female couplings and mechanical switch and port are all located immediately adjacent to the hand set to allow easy operation.

In a step the tapered tip of the catheter is inserted into the oral cavity. Due to the potential for inducing pain or a gag reflex the oral cavity is preferably pretreated with lidocaine spray or other topical anesthetic before insertion depending upon the circumstances a muscle relaxant may be indicated. In an alternative embodiment the tapered tip of the catheter is inserted into a surgically created stoma.

The preferred size of the catheter will be responsive to the orifice through which the catheter is inserted. The choice of pharmaceutical agents to be infused prior to or during treatment will be responsive to judgments by medical personnel and may include lubricants anesthetics antispasmodics anti inflammatories antibiotics or other agents.

In a step the catheter is threaded through the throat into the esophagus. Precautions are preferably taken to ensure that the catheter is not threaded through the trachea into the lungs.

In a step the catheter is positioned near the Barrett s esophagus. In the preferred embodiment viewing apparatus coupled to the port may be used to examine the region and determine which specific tissues are targeted for ablation. Healthy tissue composed of white squamous cells is distinguished from unhealthy pink columnar cells indicative of Barrett s esophagus.

In a step the syringe is used to exert positive pressure and inflate the balloon with a flowable substance such as air or liquid. Inflation of the balloon serves several purposes. In addition to positioning the electrode the balloon also helps anchor the catheter and prevents gas or liquids arising in the stomach from contaminating the region.

In a step inflating of the balloon causes expansion of the set of struts . Any corrections in the positioning of the catheter are made at this time using the visual apparatus coupled through the port .

In a step one or more electrodes are selected for extension into the columnar cells targeted for treatment. The particular treatment can include one or more of or some combination of ablation coating expansion plumping shaping shrinking or related techniques. The mechanical switch is used to extend at least one electrode into the targeted columnar cells.

In a step RF energy is provided to the electrodes so as to ablate the targeted columnar cells. In a preferred embodiment the RF energy has a frequency between 435 and 485 kilohertz. The tissue immediately near the electrodes receives the RF energy. The strength and duration of time the energy is applied are responsive to judgments by medical personnel. In alternative embodiments the electrodes may deliver other forms of energy such as heat microwaves infrared or visible laser energy. In other alternative embodiments the electrodes are controlled by a feedback technique using at least one sensor such as an impedance or temperature sensor.

To perform ablation the tissue is heated for a short period of time until ablation occurs. Application of RF energy causes cell death by dehydration or denaturation of cellular proteins.

To perform expansion plumping or shaping the tissue is suffused with a flowable substance such as a gas or liquid a collagen or another substance that can be absorbed by the body structure or tissue. The flowable substance can be exuded from the catheter either using a separate flow line or using the electrodes themselves. In a preferred embodiment the tissue is heated for a short time and thereafter cooled so as to cause the flowable substance to crosslink or otherwise transform into a bulking plumping or shaping agent.

To perform coating the flowable substance can be exuded so as to adhere to or be adsorbed by an epithelial layer of cells. In a preferred embodiment the tissue is heated for a short time and thereafter cooled so as to cause the flowable substance to crosslink or otherwise transform into a solid mass coating or covering the epithelial layer.

To perform shrinking the tissue is suffused with the flowable substance with the flowable substance being selected so as to act as a receiving antenna or dielectric for the RF energy. RF energy is applied which is differentially absorbed by the flowable substance this causes the flowable substance to heat and to shrink the tissue is suffused either by cell death dehydration or denaturation of cellular proteins.

In a step flowable substances are provided through the holes in the electrodes the micropores of the balloon or from the struts if needed to immediately cool down the region and prevent collateral thermal damage. The nature temperature and amount of the flowable substance are responsive to judgments by medical personnel.

In a step the catheter is withdrawn from the oral cavity. In an alternative embodiment the catheter is withdrawn from a stoma.

A method is performed using a catheter and electrode assembly . This method requires the use of four to eight electrodes and a blunt tapered tip .

In a step an enema is performed to clear the region of fecal matter. The rectum and surrounding area are washed with a cleansing agent such as benzalonium chloride. A topical anesthetic may be applied to prevent pain associated with insertion depending upon the circumstances a muscle relaxant may be indicated. The tapered tip of the catheter is inserted into the anus.

The preferred size of the catheter will be responsive to the orifice through which the catheter is inserted. The choice of pharmaceutical agents to be infused prior to or during treatment will be responsive to judgments by medical personnel and may include lubricants anesthetics antispasmodics anti inflammatories antibiotics or other agents.

In a step the catheter is threaded into the anus so that the electrodes are positioned neat the dentate line.

In a step the catheter is positioned neat the area to be treated. In the preferred embodiment viewing apparatus such as an anoscope coupled to port may be used to examine the region and determine which specific tissues are targeted for ablation. In an alternative embodiment the area can be accessed using a colorectal ultrasound probe. It is important to distinguish between the voluntary and involuntary sphincter because fecal incontinence is frequently causes by defects in the involuntary sphincter. One of the goals of treatment is to avoid exacerbating the incontinence problem by injuring the voluntary sphincter.

In a step the syringe is used to exert positive pressure and inflate the balloon with air or with a liquid. Inflation of the balloon serves several purposes. In addition to positioning the electrode the balloon also helps anchor the catheter and prevents gas liquid or fecal matter from contaminating the region. If necessary a second balloon can be used to anchor the catheter distally.

In a step inflation of the balloon causes expansion of the set of struts . Any corrections in the positioning of the catheter are made at this time using the visual apparatus coupled through the port .

In a step four or more electrodes are selected for extension into the involuntary sphincter. The mechanical switch is used to extent the electrodes into the involuntary sphincter. Thermal injury to sensitive female structures is avoided by selecting electrodes in area other than the anterior portion of the anus. In both sexes treatment is directed to the area one to two centimeter above and up to one centimeter below the dentate line. Highly innervated regions of tissue are avoided so as to minimize pain.

In a step RF energy is provided to the electrodes until thermal lesions are created in the targeted area s . In a preferred embodiment the RF energy has a frequency between 435 kilohertz and 485 kilohertz. The RF energy is received by the tissue immediately near the electrodes.
