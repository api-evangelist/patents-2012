This application is a continuation of U.S. Nonprovisional application Ser. No. 12 233 266 entitled USING RSS ARCHIVES filed Sep. 18 2008 266 Application now U.S. Pat. No. 8 140 482. The 266 Application claims priority under 35 USC 119 e to provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. 60 973 480 filed on Sep. 19 2007 and to provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. 61 082 802 filed on Jul. 22 2008 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Internet searching has attracted significant activity aimed at improving the speed scope and relevance of search results. Some companies have also leveraged popular search engines into related areas such as targeted advertising and specialty searches. Beneath these web based or programming interface based search systems lay technologies for locating content indexing content and determining the relevance of content in response to particular search requests. Often such systems focus on finding content among the billions of web pages and other content items on the World Wide Web.

As RSS becomes an increasingly popular medium for Internet communications and communities there as an increasing need to store and index historical RSS data. A system and method for searching content specific sources metadata sources and distribution channels such as archived RSS datafeed information is described herein.

In one aspect an archival format may permit full reconstruction of any historical RSS feed. The archived data may include time stamping or other certification of time so that publication dates are accurately and non repudiatably preserved.

In another aspect an archival format may extract and more efficiently store elements of an RSS feed such as text enclosures and the like. This data may be stored according to relevant tags with certain tags and tagged content being removed. In another aspect the original RSS content may be processed for archiving. For example the text portion may be enhanced based on what appears in HTML source code for an item or from a feed.

It will be understood that the archival format may be standardized so that a corresponding database will include suitable fields or indices for generalized or specific post archiving uses. For example time stamps may be used as noted above. As another example certain feed or item metadata from the HTML code may be extracted and stored with item content. In particular information such as source information author unique ID or permalink data and so forth may be extracted in order to uniquely identify RSS text after surrounding HTML or XML based metadata has been removed for archiving.

The extracted data may be added directly to a text form of the item for archiving. In another aspect the extracted data may be stored in a suitably configured relational database or other storage medium.

It will be further appreciated that the archival format may be supplemented with additional data not present in the feed or item HTML. For example semantic metadata may be generated relating to popularity subject matter usage or other characteristics of a particular item or a feed from which the item was obtained.

An archive may be adapted for specific or general use. For example a market specific archive e.g. real estate medical financial and so forth may be created that is supplemented with relevant metadata. And for each market certain existing metadata may be retained in the archival format or dispensed with entirely.

In some aspects a method includes processing two or more independent RSS data feeds to generate two or more RSS market specific searchable RSS datafeed archives. The method also includes generating using a master probe device a probe plan based on an input received from a user. The method also includes applying using a plurality of slave probe devices at least two different probes to the archives to derive information based on data in the searchable RSS datafeed archives the probes being part of the probe plan to determine a result based on the derived information. At least one of the probes is applied to at least two of the searchable RSS datafeed archives and at least two of the probes are applied to the same searchable RSS datafeed archive. The method also includes determining the result based on the derived information and generating an RSS feed that includes the result.

The market specific datafeed archives can include one or more of a real estate datafeed archive a medical datafeed archive and a financial datafeed archive.

Processing the two or more independent data feeds can include storing metadata and an automatically generated importance value.

Determining the result can include receiving sub results from one or more of the at least two different probes the sub results differing in structure and format and combining the sub results to generate the result.

Combining the sub results can include identifying a first sub result that is a duplicate or near duplicate of a second sub result and generating a hyperlink to the second sub result.

In some additional aspects a method includes processing two or more independent data feeds to generate two or more searchable datafeed archives. The method also includes applying at least two different probes to the archives to derive information based on data in the archives the probes being part of a probe plan to determine a result based on the derived information at least one of the probes being applied to at least two of the archives. The method also includes determining the result based on the derived information and providing the result for use in a real world application.

Processing the two or more independent datafeeds can include processing the two or more independent datafeeds to generate market specific datafeed archives.

The market specific datafeed archives can include one or more of a real estate datafeed archive a medical datafeed archive and a financial datafeed archive.

Processing the two or more independent data feeds can include storing metadata and an automatically generated importance value.

Determining the result can include receiving sub results from one or more of the probes the sub results differing in structure and format. The method can also include combining the sub results to generate the result. Combining the sub results can include identifying a first sub result that is a duplicate or near duplicate of a second sub result and generating a hyperlink to the second sub result.

In some additional aspects a method includes generating based on a probe plan and a search request probes the probes differing from one another and configured to search market specific searchable datafeed archives. The method also includes receiving in response to the probes sub results from one or more of the probes. The method also includes determining a result based on the sub results and providing the result for use in a real world application.

The market specific datafeed archives can include one or more of a real estate datafeed archive a medical datafeed archive and a financial datafeed archive.

Determining the result can include receiving sub results from one or more of the probes the sub results differing in structure and format. The method can also include combining the sub results to generate the result.

It will be understood that while RSS is used herein as a convenient and commonly used example of an XML based and syndication ready grammar other XML based systems may be suitably archived using the techniques described herein including without limitation other syndication technologies such as Atom and other grammars such as OPML for outlining and so forth.

Metadata may be extracted from an RSS channel description or from a particular RSS item. This includes any metadata encoded in the HTML associated with an RSS item. This metadata may be directly extracted for storage or may be analyzed by an analysis engine for purposes of filtering enriching or otherwise processing the metadata to produce new metadata associated with the item or the channel . However obtained a selected portion of extracted or derived metadata may be stored with an RSS archival format.

Content typically text but also including enclosures of any form or other content contained within an RSS item may also be extracted for storage in the archival format. In addition the content may itself be analyzed by the analysis engine and metadata may be generated based upon the content either alone or in combination with other available metadata for storage with the other metadata of the archival format.

The archival format may take any suitable form including an archival XML grammar a simple text document which may be subject to one or more constraints to preserve archival metadata such as key value pairs metadata delimiters or the like . The archival format may also be preserved in a suitably constructed database which may be indexed for example by content metadata or a combination of these.

These and other aspects and features and combinations of them may be expressed as methods apparatus systems program products databases methods of doing business and means for performing functions and in other ways.

Referring now to an RSS channel may comprise an XML data feed in the RSS format the Atom format or any and all other suitable formats. The RSS channel may comprise one or more RSS items which may encompass data structures that are formatted according to the RSS 2.0 specification the Atom specification or any and all other suitable specification. In embodiments such specifications may be expressed in DTD XML Schema or any and all other schema language or the like. Each RSS item may encompass content such as and without limitation bits bytes strings binaries and so on. In embodiments the content may be organized into elements each of which may be associated with a data type and or a unique identifier.

Any and all instances of content and therefore any and all instances of an RSS channel or item may comprise or be associated with metadata . In embodiments an analysis engine may process instances and generate the metadata as a result of the processing. This processing may be entirely automatic such as and without limitation according to an algorithm heuristic or the like. For example and without limitation the automatic processing may recognize that many instances contain a hyperlink to a particular instance. Based upon this recognition the automatic processing may generate metadata indicating that the particular instance is relatively important. Alternatively this processing may include accepting a human input. For example and without limitation the human input may comprise a tag that is associated with a folksonomy collaborative tagging social classification social indexing social tagging or the like. Many examples of automatic processing and processing that accepts a human input will be appreciated and all such examples and others are intended to fall within the scope of the claims.

An RSS archival format may specify embodiments of RSS items and or RSS channels in association with metadata. In embodiments an RSS archive may comprise data that is formatted according to the RSS archival format. It will be appreciated that such data could be stored in a database a flat file system a data stream and so on. An example RSS archive provided for the purpose of illustration and not limitation is as follows 

In the foregoing example an RSS 2.0 feed includes an RSS channel and the RSS channel includes two RSS items. The RSS channel includes an instance of metadata the metadata being of class automatic and style importance . An automatic process of the analysis engine may generate this metadata. This metadata contains two elements one of type importance and the other of type date rated . The importance element may be a score on 1 to 10 scale and the date rate element may be the date on which the automatic process determined the importance. One of the RSS items also includes an instance of metadata the metadata being of class human input and style folksonomy . A process of the analysis engine and that accepts human input may generate this metadata. This metadata contains two elements both of which are of type tag . Each of these elements contain values cats and humor that may have been provided to the automatic process by a human. In light of the foregoing example instance of an RSS archive innumerable RSS archival formats will be appreciated and all such formats and others are intended to fall within the scope of the claims.

Referring now to systems and methods for searching RSS feeds and RSS archives may comprise a plurality of RSS feeds a plurality of RSS archives a plurality of slave search engines e.g. slave search engines and a plurality of sub queries e.g. subqueries and a master search engine and a query . Some of the slave search engines for example engines and may receive at least one of the RSS feeds . Some of the slave search engines for example engines and may be associated with at least one of the RSS archives . Some of the slave search engines for example engine may both receive at least one of the RSS feeds and be associated with at least one of the RSS archives .

The master search engine may receive a query . The query may be a structured query an unstructured query an XML query an SQL query and so on. In embodiments a user or an automatic process may provide the query . For example and without limitation a user may be interested in accessing all RSS items that relate to cats. The user may transmit a free form text string for example tuxedo cats to the master search engine. The master search engine may receive this text string as the query.

In response to the query the master search engine may devise a query plan that involves communicating at least one sub query e.g. one of queries and to at least one of the slave search engines . The sub queries and may be formatted according to any and all query languages and formats. In embodiments the master search engine may submit the sub queries and to the slave search engines and via SOAP via a REST ful interface via an API via a remote procedure call and so on. In embodiments the master search engine may be operatively coupled to the slave search engines and via the Internet a public network a private network a virtual private network and so on. In embodiments the master search engine and the slave search engines and may operate under separate administrative control and the sub queries and may be transmitted via a public interface a protected interface a private interface or the like.

In embodiments the slave search engines and may exist as public services that are operated independently from one another. For example and without limitation the following RSS search engines may be employed as slave search engines Bloglines BlogPulse Daypop Feedster Findory Blogory Gigablast Blog Search IceRocket Blog Search PubSub and Technorati. In addition slave search engines may include proprietary archives of RSS content that are not open to public use or that require registration login subscription fees or the like. Each of the slave search engines may implement an interface query format feature set search capability or the like that differs from another one of the slave search engines.

In embodiments the master search engine may encompass a library or collection of bridges adaptors converters interfaces or the like that enable the master search engine to communicate sub queries in a plurality of query formats and with respect to a plurality of interfaces feature sets search capabilities and the like. In any case the master search engine may prepare a plurality of sub queries in response to the query . Each of the sub queries and may be tailored to one of the slave search engines and . The master search engine communicates the sub queries and to the corresponding slave search engines and .

While in the example described above in relation to three slave search engines and three sub queries have been described any number of save search engines can be associated with the master search engine and each slave engine can receive one or more sub queries.

Referring now to each of the slave search engines and may generate a partial result e.g. partial results and in response to the sub query that it received. As with the sub queries each of the partial results and may be formatted or structured in a way that differs from another partial result. The master search engine receives the partial results and from the slave search engines and . The library or collection of bridges adaptors converters interfaces or the like that enable the master search engine to communicate sub queries may also enable the master search engine to receive partial results and from a plurality of slave search engines and and in a plurality of formats.

Any and all of the partial results may comprise metadata RSS feeds RSS archives RSS items XML or any and all other forms of data. The master search engine may combine some or all of the partial results and into a single result which itself may comprise a plurality of elements. This result may be formatted as an HTML page an RSS feed a database table a combination of any and all of the foregoing or the like. All together the partial results may contain duplicate or near duplicate RSS items RSS feeds RSS archives and the like. To compensate for this embodiments of the result may contain one element that is representative of the duplicate or near duplicate elements plus a hyperlink or the like that is associated with this one element the hyperlink providing access to all of the duplicate or near duplicate elements of this one element.

Embodiments of the master search engine may provide a web portal with an HTML form or the like into which a user may enter a query. Embodiments of the master search engine may provide an API or programmatic interface for communicating queries and results.

Various services may be provided based upon a content archive which may include archiving for RSS data HTML data OPML data or any other XML data and the like as well as media and other content files associated with any of the foregoing.

In one aspect a search engine may be provided that spans multiple archives of RSS content. Thus where multiple archives exist for content a meta search engine may be provided to span content in all such archives. This may include searching of archives provided by various RSS content providers as well as independent or third party archives discovered and explored using e.g. spiders link analysis and so forth.

Another service may provide user configurable archiving. In one aspect this provides a user with a persistent store of data for one or more RSS feeds or the like so that content of interest can be preserved regardless of the persistence of the feed source. Such archives may be prepared based upon original source content aggregated content and so forth. In creating such an archive a user may specify one or more sources and may specify archiving parameters such as frequency of archiving e.g. hourly daily weekly monthly etc. storage capacity link depth such as whether and how links within an archived item are navigated stored and so forth. A user may also specify access credentials for secure content where appropriate.

More generally any web content may be periodically archived under user control. Thus for example a user may specify locations of interest and have these locations periodically archived to provide both persistence and a time based view of content at these locations. This service may be usefully employed for example to archive a user s web content such as social networking pages professional web sites and so forth. The service may also or instead be usefully employed to periodically capture competitive data time based commentary subject matter based news items and so forth any or all of which may be archived for subsequent retrieval and review by the user. Archiving instructions may also include for example login credentials or the like for accessing proprietary content of the user or content to which the user is a paid subscriber. The system may usefully explore links within archived content and archive some or all of the linked content as well. This link depth may be specified by the user in either absolute terms e.g. archive one link content two link content etc. or in relative terms e.g. all links within domain all links having a certain path etc. . In one embodiment such a service may be used in a content management system to archive and or audit content on a website or the like.

In one aspect a web archiving service may be combined with a desktop backup client so that a user can specify within a single interface both local files and remote content for archiving within a single interface or operation.
