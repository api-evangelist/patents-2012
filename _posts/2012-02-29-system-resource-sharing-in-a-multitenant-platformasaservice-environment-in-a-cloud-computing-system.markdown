No. 13 408 676 entitled Mechanism for Applying a Custom Security Type Label to Multi Tenant Applications of a Node in a Platform as a Service PaaS Environment which are all assigned to the assignee of the present application.

The embodiments of the invention relate generally to platform as a service PaaS environments and more specifically relate to a mechanism for system resource sharing in a multi tenant PaaS environment in a cloud computing system.

Cloud computing is a computing paradigm in which a customer pays a cloud provider to execute a program on computer hardware owned and or controlled by the cloud provider. It is common for cloud providers to make virtual machines hosted on its computer hardware available to customers for this purpose. The cloud provider typically provides an interface that a customer can use to requisition virtual machines and associated resources such as processors storage and network services etc. as well as an interface a customer can use to install and execute the customer s program on the virtual machines that the customer requisitions together with additional software on which the customer s program depends. For some such programs this additional software can include software components such as a kernel and an operating system. Customers that have installed and are executing their programs in the cloud typically communicate with the executing program from remote geographic locations using Internet protocols.

For programs that are web applications the additional software can further include such software components as middleware and a framework. Web applications are programs that receive and act on requests in web or other Internet protocols such as HTTP. It is common for a user to use a web application by using a browser executing on the user s client computer system to send requests in a web protocol via the Internet to a server computer system on which the web application is executing. It is also common for automatic user agents to interact with web applications in web protocols in the same fashion.

While many web applications are suitable for execution in the cloud it often requires significant expertise and effort in order to install execute and manage a web application in the cloud. For example an administrator typically must identify all of the software components that a web application needs in order to execute and what versions of those software components are acceptable. In addition the administrator typically should obtain install and appropriately configure each such software component as well as the application itself. Where this high level of expertise and effort has been invested in order to get a web application running on a particular hypervisor and in a particular provider s cloud a similarly high level of expertise and effort usually should be subsequently invested to execute the web application instead or in addition on a different hypervisor and or in a different particular provider s cloud. Also it can be difficult to obtain useful information about how the application is performing and otherwise behaving when executing in the cloud.

Accordingly software and or hardware facilities for facilitating the execution of web applications in the cloud have been introduced and are known as Platform as a Service PaaS offerings. PaaS offerings typically facilitate deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software and provisioning hosting capabilities providing all of the facilities required to support the complete life cycle of building and delivering web application and service entirely available from the Internet. Typically these facilities operate as one or more virtual machines VMs running on top of a hypervisor in a host server.

In present PaaS offerings a first customer s deployed applications do not co exist with any other customer s deployed applications on the VMs that are hosting the first customer s deployed applications. However such an arrangement can be inefficient to the PaaS provider offering the platform services. This is because the applications being deployed in the PaaS are generally quite small packages and the size of the VM does not correspond to the size of the application. It can be costly to initialize a new VM for each application deployment and it may also be a waste of resources that are not being utilized. In a public cloud environment a PaaS provider pays for deploying a VM whether the VM lies idle or not. In a private cloud environment there is still a strain on resources for running VMs that are not completely utilized.

Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for system resource sharing in a multi tenant Platform as a Service PaaS environment in a cloud computing system. A method of embodiments of the invention includes receiving by a virtual machine VM identification of resource usage groups that each define resource constraints to apply to applications having a type of the resource usage group establishing a resource control policy on the VM for each of the identified resource usage groups the resource control policy to enforce the resource constraints of its associated resource usage group configuring a plurality of resource control tools of the VM to implement each resource control policy identifying a resource usage group of an application to be created on the VM applying by the one or more resource control tools to the application the resource control policy of the identified resource usage group of the application and executing the application with the defined resource constraints on the VM.

In the following description numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as sending receiving attaching forwarding caching executing applying identifying configuring establishing or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a machine readable storage medium such as but not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions each coupled to a computer system bus.

The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear as set forth in the description below. In addition the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.

The present invention may be provided as a computer program product or software that may include a machine readable medium having stored thereon instructions which may be used to program a computer system or other electronic devices to perform a process according to the present invention. A machine readable medium includes any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer . For example a machine readable e.g. computer readable medium includes a machine e.g. a computer readable storage medium e.g. read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices etc. etc.

Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for system resource sharing in a multi tenant PaaS environment in a cloud computing system. In the multi tenant PaaS environment each node i.e. virtual machine VM in the PaaS environment runs multiple applications and as such shares its resources between these applications. To enable this resource sharing each node VM is set up to utilize multiple resource control tools as one coherent restriction on applications running on the node. In one embodiment each node VM is categorized to provide resources for applications falling into a particular resource usage group. Subsequently the various resource control tools of the node are programmed to implement the resource restrictions for any applications starting and running on the node in a uniform manner. This allows the resources of a single node VM to be subdivided for use by many applications simultaneously in embodiments of the invention.

Clients and are connected to hosts and the cloud provider system via a network which may be a private network e.g. a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN intranet or other similar private networks or a public network e.g. the Internet . Each client may be a mobile device a PDA a laptop a desktop computer or any other computing device. Each host may be a server computer system a desktop computer or any other computing device. The cloud provider system may include one or more machines such as server computers desktop computers etc.

In one embodiment the cloud provider system is coupled to a cloud controller via the network . The cloud controller may reside on one or more machines e.g. server computers desktop computers etc. and may manage the execution of applications in the cloud . In some embodiments cloud controller receives commands from PaaS provider controller . Based on these commands the cloud controller provides data e.g. such as pre generated images associated with different applications to the cloud provider system . In some embodiments the data may be provided to the cloud provider and stored in an image repository in an image repository not shown located on each host or in an image repository not shown located on each VM .

Upon receiving a command identifying specific data e.g. application data and files used to initialize an application on the cloud the cloud provider retrieves the corresponding data from the image repository creates an instance of it and loads it to the host to run on top of a hypervisor not shown as a VM or within a VM . In addition a command may identify specific data to be executed on one or more of the VMs . The command may be received from the cloud controller from a PaaS Provider Controller or a user e.g. a system administrator via a console computer or a client machine. The image repository may be local or remote and may represent a single data structure or multiple data structures databases repositories files etc. residing on one or more mass storage devices such as magnetic or optical storage based disks solid state drives SSDs or hard drives.

While various embodiments are described in terms of the environment described above those skilled in the art will appreciate that the facility may be implemented in a variety of other environments including a single monolithic computer system as well as various other combinations of computer systems or similar devices connected in various ways.

In one embodiment the client layer resides on a client machine such as a workstation of a software developer and provides an interface to a user of the client machine to a broker layer of the PaaS system . For example the broker layer may facilitate the creation and deployment on the cloud via node layer of software applications being developed by an end user at client layer .

In one embodiment the client layer includes a source code management system sometimes referred to as SCM or revision control system. One example of such an SCM or revision control system is Git available as open source software. Git and other such distributed SCM systems usually include a working directory for making changes and a local software repository for storing the changes. The packaged software application can then be pushed from the local Git repository to a remote Git repository. From the remote repository the code may be edited by others with access or the application may be executed by a machine. Other SCM systems work in a similar manner.

The client layer in one embodiment also includes a set of command tools that a user can utilize to create launch and manage applications. In one embodiment the command tools can be downloaded and installed on the user s client machine and can be accessed via a command line interface or a graphical user interface or some other type of interface. In one embodiment the command tools expose an application programming interface API of the broker layer and perform other applications management tasks in an automated fashion using other interfaces as will be described in more detail further below in accordance with some embodiments.

In one embodiment the broker layer acts as middleware between the client layer and the node layer . The node layer includes the nodes on which software applications are provisioned and executed. In one embodiment each node is a VM provisioned by an Infrastructure as a Service IaaS provider such as Amazon Web Services. In other embodiments the nodes may be physical machines or VMs residing on a single physical machine. In one embodiment the broker layer is implemented on one or more machines such as server computers desktop computers etc. In some embodiments the broker layer may be implemented on one or more machines separate from machines implementing each of the client layer and the node layer or may implemented together with the client layer and or the node layer on one or more machines or some combination of the above.

In one embodiment the broker layer includes a broker that coordinates requests from the client layer with actions to be performed at the node layer . One such request is new application creation. In one embodiment when a user using the command tools at client layer requests the creation of a new application or some other action to manage the application the broker first authenticates the user using an authentication service . In one embodiment the authentication service may comprise Streamline or may comprise some other authentication tool. Once the user has been authenticated and allowed access to the system by authentication service the broker uses a server orchestration system to collect information and configuration information about the nodes .

In one embodiment the broker uses the Marionette Collective MCollective framework available from Puppet Labs as the server orchestration system but other server orchestration systems may also be used. The server orchestration system in one embodiment functions to coordinate server client interaction between multiple sometimes a large number of servers. In one embodiment the servers being orchestrated are nodes which are acting as application servers and web servers.

For example if the broker wanted to shut down all applications on all even numbered nodes out of 100 000 nodes the broker would only need to provide one command to the server orchestration system . Then the server orchestration system would generate a separate message to all nodes to shut down all applications if the node is even and distribute the messages to the nodes using a messaging and queuing system. Thus in one embodiment the broker manages the business logic and model representing the nodes and the applications residing on the nodes and acts as a controller that generates the actions requested by users via an API of the client tools . The server orchestration system then takes those actions generated by the broker and orchestrates their execution on the many nodes managed by the system.

In one embodiment the information collected about the nodes can be stored in a data store . In one embodiment the data store can be a locally hosted database or file store or it can be a cloud based storage service provided by a Storage as a Service SaaS storage provider such as Amazon S3 Simple Storage Service . The broker uses the information about the nodes and their applications to model the application hosting service and to maintain records about the nodes. In one embodiment node data is stored in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation JSON blob or string that maintains key value pairs to associate a unique identifier a hostname a list of applications and other such attributes with the node.

In embodiments of the invention the PaaS system architecture of is a multi tenant PaaS environment. In a multi tenant PaaS environment each node runs multiple applications that may be owned or managed by different users and or organizations. As such a first customer s deployed applications may co exist with any other customer s deployed applications on the same node VM that is hosting the first customer s deployed applications . This deployment of multiple applications of multiple customers on a single node VM is a cost efficient solution for PaaS providers. However deploying a multi tenant PaaS solution raises a variety of concerns including for example efficient resource sharing on the node s limited resources between the applications hosted on the node and security between the applications hosted on the node .

Embodiments of the invention provide for efficient resource sharing between applications hosted on a multi tenant node by setting up each node to utilize multiple resource control tools as a single coherent restriction on applications running on the node . One embodiment of the interaction between the server orchestration system and a node to implement efficient resource sharing for multi tenant applications is now described in more detail with reference to .

The node also include a server orchestration system agent configured to track and collect information about the node and to perform actions on the node . Thus in one embodiment using MCollective as the server orchestration system the server orchestration system agent can be implemented as a MCollective server. The server orchestration system would then be the MCollective client that can send requests queries and commands to the MCollective server on node .

In one embodiment server orchestration system categorizes applications into defined resource usage groups. A resource usage group defines the amount of resources e.g. CPU memory storage disk I O network I O etc. that an application is allotted when executing on a node . In one embodiment each node is configured to host applications from a single resource usage group. In other embodiments a node may be configured to host applications from more than one resource usage group. However for efficiency purposes and ease of configuration a node generally hosts applications from one or a small number of resource usage groups. In some embodiments the resource usage group type of an application is determined based on the platform that a customer requests for their application or based on a service level agreement associated with the customer.

When a server orchestration system is initially configuring a new node with no applications running on the node one or more resource control tools are setup and configured on the node . In one embodiment the resource control tools include but are not limited to a kernel resource usage tool a disk storage control tool a network traffic control tool and any other resource control tools for controlling node resources.

In one embodiment the kernel resource usage tool is Linux control groups cgroups the disk storage control tool is Linux Disk Quota and the network traffic control tool is Linux Traffic Control tc . Cgroups is a Linux kernel feature that creates collections of processes e.g. applications that are bound by the same criteria such as constraining CPU usage memory allocation and disk I O bandwidth of each process in the collection. The application groupings provided by cgroups can then be used by subsystems of the OS to constrain the CPU memory and disk I O of each of the processes according to the configuration of the particular cgroup. Examples of these subsystems include various drivers associated with the resources.

Disk Quotas is a Linux feature that allows a maximum amount of disk space to be allocated to a user of a group. Disk Quotas defines the maximum number of blocs and or inodes that can have a single UID value within a controlled file system. Because each application process is associated with a unique UID and because an application process can only create and write new files that have the same ownership or group as denoted by the UID on the files this effectively places a limit on the size of the file space owned by the UID account e.g. application .

Tc is a Linux kernel feature that encompasses the set of tools for managing network I O bandwidth of processes on a network interface. In one embodiment another resource control tool may be Linux Pluggable Authentication Module PAM limits module. PAM limits is a PAM module that sets limits on system resources that can be obtained during a user session. In this context user refers to the user of the local user ID UID assigned to an application. In one embodiment the PAM limits module sets hard upper limits to the number of processes that an application can have at any one time. The limits apply to all processes owned by the application. Some other limits set by the PAM limits module may relate to aggregate usage e.g. number of processes while others may apply to individual processes e.g. max memory max file size etc. .

In one embodiment server orchestration system also creates a resource control module on the node to implement a resource control policy for the node . In some embodiments the resource control module is implemented as software on node that includes instructions to apply the resource control policy to applications . The resource control policy provides the overriding framework for the resource control tools to follow in order to implement resource controls e.g. cgroups constraining CPU memory and disk I O of the application Disk Quota confining the disk space for the application tc managing transmission of packets for the application PAM limits setting limits on process resources etc. for an application assigned to a particular resource usage group. The resource control policy programs the various disparate resource control tools to act as a single unit in order to implement the resource controls for applications starting and running on the node in a uniform manner.

In one embodiment the resource control module may receive data at initialization of the node or during some other update to node from server orchestration system regarding the various resource usage groups of applications and their associated resource limitations. For example server orchestration system may inform control module that node will host applications implemented on a JBoss platform. As part of the configuration settings of the PaaS system all JBoss platform applications may have been assigned a set of resource controls such as a specific share allocation of CPU usage memory allotment share allocation of disk I O bandwidth and a share allocation of networking I O bandwidth. This set of resource controls is delineated in a single resource control policy which is also provided to node by server orchestration system .

Then the resource control module correspondingly directs the resource control tools to create the control groups or file system partitions that implement the resource controls for an application of a particular resource usage group. As mentioned above when a node is initialized to host applications of a single type of resource usage group the resource control tools are correspondingly configured to implement the resource control policies of that resource usage group to the entire node . However if a node is initialized to host applications from more than one type of resource usage group then the resource control tools are correspondingly configured to implement a variety of different resource control policies for the node and will accordingly create multiple different control groups or partitions to enable these multiple different resource control policies.

For example cgroups creates configuration information for control groups that are bound by the same criteria e.g. a specific share of CPU processing time a specific memory space allotment a specific share of disk I O bandwidth a specific disk storage limits and a specific share of networking I O bandwidth . As such cgroups may create multiple different process collections e.g. control groups that are each configured with resource constraints in accordance with the resource policy of the resource usage group. When a new application joins the node the process of the application can be assigned its own control group that is bound by the resource limitations defined in the configuration information for the resource usage group that the application falls under. In another example disk quotas may be pre configured for applications of each resource usage group by creating the different file locations that are controlled by disk quotas. Once a new application joins the node it can be assigned to a file location that was pre configured for an application of the resource usage group.

In one embodiment the resource control module communicates with OS in order to direct any kernel level resource control tools . In some embodiments the resource control policy may include a mapping of resource usage group types to control groups or partitions which are managed by resource control tools that implement the necessary resource limitations for an application of each resource usage group type.

Once a node has been configured for resource control of applications the server orchestration system agent waits for commands from the server orchestration system such as a command to start a new application. As part of the process for launching a new application on node server orchestration system agent interacts with resource control module to implement resource control policies on the new application according to the resource usage group that the application is part of. When the server orchestration system makes a call to the server orchestration system agent to start an application the server orchestration system agent determines the resource usage group type of the application. In one embodiment the type may be explicitly provided as data to the server orchestration system agent as part of the start new application command. In other embodiments the server orchestration system agent may implicit determine the resource usage group type based on other identifying information of the application e.g. a platform of the application .

Based on the determined resource usage group type of the application the resource control module accesses the resource control policy associated with the particular type and directs the resource control tools to implement their associated policies to enforce the resource constraints for the application according to its resource usage group type. Then throughout the lifetime of the application on the node the resource constraints are consistently enforced. As a result the resources of the single node VM can be subdivided for use by many multi tenant applications simultaneously in embodiments of the invention.

Method begins at block where as part of initialization of a node VM data is received by the node that indicates one or more resource usage groups of applications that will be hosted by the node. A resource usage group defines the amount of resources e.g. CPU memory storage disk I O network I O etc. that an application is allotted when executing on the node. In one embodiment the resource usage groups and the corresponding applications that the groups apply to are defined and configured by an administrator of the PaaS system on the broker layer. The resource usage group policies are then pushed down from the server orchestration system at the broker layer to the individual nodes for implementation. In one embodiment the node is configured to host applications from a single resource usage group. In other embodiments a node is configured to host applications from more than one resource usage group.

Then at block the node instructs one or more resource control tools of the node to configure resource control policies based on configuration settings provided to the node from a server orchestration system of a broker layer of the PaaS system. These resource control policies are applied to applications grouped under the indicated resource usage groups. Each resource control policy of the node provides a framework for the resource control tools to follow in order to implement resource control for an application assigned to a particular resource usage group. The resource control policy programs the various disparate resource control tools to act as a single unit in order to implement the resource restrictions for applications starting and running on the node in accordance with their associated resource usage group

In one embodiment the resource control tools comprise a kernel resource usage tool a disk storage control tool a network traffic control tool and any other resource control tools known to one skilled in the art. For example the kernel resource usage tool is Linux cgroups the disk storage control tool is Linux Disk Quota and the network traffic control tool is Linux tc. Cgroups creates create multiple different process collections e.g. control groups that are each configured with resource limitations in accordance with the resource limitations assigned to resource usage group. Disk quotas creates different file locations on the disk of the node that are controlled by disk quotas of a corresponding resource usage group. Tc creates custom configurations to control network traffic of applications corresponding to each resource usage group.

Subsequently at block a mapping is created based on the provided configuration settings from the server orchestration system of the indicated resource usage groups to the specific configurations implemented by each of the resource control tools to enforce the resource limitations of each resource usage group is created. In one embodiment this mapping is stored with the resource control policies implemented by the node. Lastly at block a resource policy configuration completion message is sent to the server orchestration system to inform the server orchestration that the resource configuration has finished at the node and that the node is ready to receive applications on which to apply these resource control policies.

Method begins at block where a request is received at the node from a server orchestration system of a broker layer of the PaaS system. In one embodiment the request is to create a new application on the node. The request includes identifying information about the application to be set up. For example the information may include one or more file repositories stored on the node to be utilized to initialize the application. At block a resource usage group type of the application is determined. In one embodiment the resource usage group type is included in the identifying information about the application sent from the server orchestration system. In another embodiment the resource usage group type is implicitly determined from the identifying information sent from the server orchestration system e.g. from the platform of the application etc. .

At block based on the determined resource usage group type the node identifies a resource control policy associated with the determined resource usage group type of the application. In one embodiment the resource control policy is maintained by a resource control module of the node. In addition the resource control module maintains information regarding the specific resource limitations associated with the resource usage group of the node and a mapping of the resource configuration policies that one or more resource control tools of the node implement to the enforce the resource control policy for the resource usage group of the application.

Then at block the identified resource control policy for the application is implemented by the one or more resource control tools of the node identified by the resource control module. In one embodiment the one or more resource control tools implement resource configuration policies as indicated in the mapping to the application s resource usage group maintained by the resource control module. In one exemplary embodiment a new local UNIX user is created on the node to represent the new application. Then files to allow the application to run are collected and placed on a pre configured location of the node s file system to be controlled by Disk Quota in accordance with the resource control policy for the resource usage group of the application. When the application starts an ID of the process of the application is placed into a cgroup established for the application that implements resource control according to the resource control policy for the resource usage group of the application. In addition resource control policies are applied to the application by Linux tc based on the cgroup that the application was placed.

Once the node completes setup including resource control policy setup of the application an application setup complete confirmation message is sent to the server orchestration system at block . The setup complete confirmation message also includes an address such as an HTML address established for the application. The server orchestration system determines an end user associated with the application and provides the address to the end user. Subsequently the end user may then directly access the application on the node without requiring the broker to act as an intermediary.

The exemplary computer system includes a processing device processor a main memory e.g. read only memory ROM flash memory dynamic random access memory DRAM such as synchronous DRAM SDRAM or Rambus DRAM RDRAM etc. a static memory e.g. flash memory static random access memory SRAM etc. and a data storage device which communicate with each other via a bus .

Processor represents one or more general purpose processing devices such as a microprocessor central processing unit or the like. More particularly the processor may be a complex instruction set computing CISC microprocessor reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessor very long instruction word VLIW microprocessor or a processor implementing other instruction sets or processors implementing a combination of instruction sets. The processor may also be one or more special purpose processing devices such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA a digital signal processor DSP network processor or the like. The processor is configured to execute instructions for performing the operations and steps discussed herein illustrated in by depicting instructions within processor .

The computer system may further include a network interface device . The computer system also may include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD a cathode ray tube CRT or a touchscreen an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse and a signal generation device e.g. a speaker .

The data storage device may include a machine readable storage medium also known as a computer readable storage medium on which is stored software e.g. one or more sets of instructions software etc. embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory e.g. instructions and or within the processor e.g. processing logic during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable storage media. The software may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

In one embodiment the software include instructions for a resource control module which may correspond to resource control module of and or a software library containing methods that call the resource control module for system resource sharing in a multi tenant PaaS environment in a cloud computing system. While the machine readable storage medium is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable storage medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable storage medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention. The term machine readable storage medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories optical media and magnetic media.

In the foregoing description numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as segmenting analyzing determining enabling identifying modifying or the like refer to the actions and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.
