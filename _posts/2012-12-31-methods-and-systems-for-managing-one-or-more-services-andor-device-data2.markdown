The claims description and drawings of this application may describe one or more of the instant technologies in operational functional language for example as a set of operations to be performed by a computer. Such operational functional description in most instances would be understood by one skilled the art as specifically configured hardware e.g. because a general purpose computer in effect becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software .

Importantly although the operational functional descriptions described herein are understandable by the human mind they are not abstract ideas of the operations functions divorced from computational implementation of those operations functions. Rather the operations functions represent a specification for the massively complex computational machines or other means. As discussed in detail below the operational functional language must be read in its proper technological context i.e. as concrete specifications for physical implementations.

The logical operations functions described herein are a distillation of machine specifications or other physical mechanisms specified by the operations functions such that the otherwise inscrutable machine specifications may be comprehensible to the human mind. The distillation also allows one of skill in the art to adapt the operational functional description of the technology across many different specific vendors hardware configurations or platforms without being limited to specific vendors hardware configurations or platforms.

Some of the present technical description e.g. detailed description drawings claims etc. may be set forth in terms of logical operations functions. As described in more detail in the following paragraphs these logical operations functions are not representations of abstract ideas but rather representative of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware elements. Differently stated unless context dictates otherwise the logical operations functions will be understood by those of skill in the art to be representative of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware elements. This is true because tools available to one of skill in the art to implement technical disclosures set forth in operational functional formats tools in the form of a high level programming language e.g. C java visual basic etc. or tools in the form of Very high speed Hardware Description Language VHDL which is a language that uses text to describe logic circuits are generators of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware configurations. This fact is sometimes obscured by the broad term software but as shown by the following explanation those skilled in the art understand that what is termed software is a shorthand for a massively complex interchaining specification of ordered matter elements. The term ordered matter elements may refer to physical components of computation such as assemblies of electronic logic gates molecular computing logic constituents quantum computing mechanisms etc.

For example a high level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction e.g. multiple levels of abstraction from the details of the sequential organizations states inputs outputs etc. of the machines that a high level programming language actually specifies. See e.g. Wikipedia High level programming language http en.wikipedia.org wiki High level programming language as of Jun. 5 2012 21 00 GMT . In order to facilitate human comprehension in many instances high level programming languages resemble or even share symbols with natural languages. See e.g. Wikipedia Natural language http en.wikipedia.org wiki Natural language as of Jun. 5 2012 21 00 GMT .

It has been argued that because high level programming languages use strong abstraction e.g. that they may resemble or share symbols with natural languages they are therefore a purely mental construct. e.g. that software a computer program or computer programming is somehow an ineffable mental construct because at a high level of abstraction it can be conceived and understood in the human mind . This argument has been used to characterize technical description in the form of functions operations as somehow abstract ideas. In fact in technological arts e.g. the information and communication technologies this is not true.

The fact that high level programming languages use strong abstraction to facilitate human understanding should not be taken as an indication that what is expressed is an abstract idea. In fact those skilled in the art understand that just the opposite is true. If a high level programming language is the tool used to implement a technical disclosure in the form of functions operations those skilled in the art will recognize that far from being abstract imprecise fuzzy or mental in any significant semantic sense such a tool is instead a near incomprehensibly precise sequential specification of specific computational machines the parts of which are built up by activating selecting such parts from typically more general computational machines over time e.g. clocked time . This fact is sometimes obscured by the superficial similarities between high level programming languages and natural languages. These superficial similarities also may cause a glossing over of the fact that high level programming language implementations ultimately perform valuable work by creating controlling many different computational machines.

The many different computational machines that a high level programming language specifies are almost unimaginably complex. At base the hardware used in the computational machines typically consists of some type of ordered matter e.g. traditional electronic devices e.g. transistors deoxyribonucleic acid DNA quantum devices mechanical switches optics fluidics pneumatics optical devices e.g. optical interference devices molecules etc. that are arranged to form logic gates. Logic gates are typically physical devices that may be electrically mechanically chemically or otherwise driven to change physical state in order to create a physical reality of Boolean logic.

Logic gates may be arranged to form logic circuits which are typically physical devices that may be electrically mechanically chemically or otherwise driven to create a physical reality of certain logical functions. Types of logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers registers arithmetic logic units ALUs computer memory etc. each type of which may be combined to form yet other types of physical devices such as a central processing unit CPU the best known of which is the microprocessor. A modern microprocessor will often contain more than one hundred million logic gates in its many logic circuits and often more than a billion transistors . See e.g. Wikipedia Logic gates http en.wikipedia.org wiki Logic gates as of Jun. 5 2012 21 03 GMT .

The logic circuits forming the microprocessor are arranged to provide a microarchitecture that will carry out the instructions defined by that microprocessor s defined Instruction Set Architecture. The Instruction Set Architecture is the part of the microprocessor architecture related to programming including the native data types instructions registers addressing modes memory architecture interrupt and exception handling and external Input Output. See e.g. Wikipedia Computer architecture http en.wikipedia.org wiki Computer architecture as of Jun. 5 2012 21 03 GMT .

The Instruction Set Architecture includes a specification of the machine language that can be used by programmers to use control the microprocessor. Since the machine language instructions are such that they may be executed directly by the microprocessor typically they consist of strings of binary digits or bits. For example a typical machine language instruction might be many bits long e.g. 32 64 or 128 bit strings are currently common . A typical machine language instruction might take the form 11110000101011110000111100111111 a 32 bit instruction .

It is significant here that although the machine language instructions are written as sequences of binary digits in actuality those binary digits specify physical reality. For example if certain semiconductors are used to make the operations of Boolean logic a physical reality the apparently mathematical bits 1 and 0 in a machine language instruction actually constitute shorthand that specifies the application of specific voltages to specific wires. For example in some semiconductor technologies the binary number 1 e.g. logical 1 in a machine language instruction specifies around 5 volts applied to a specific wire e.g. metallic traces on a printed circuit board and the binary number 0 e.g. logical 0 in a machine language instruction specifies around 5 volts applied to a specific wire. In addition to specifying voltages of the machines configuration such machine language instructions also select out and activate specific groupings of logic gates from the millions of logic gates of the more general machine. Thus far from abstract mathematical expressions machine language instruction programs even though written as a string of zeros and ones specify many many constructed physical machines or physical machine states.

Machine language is typically incomprehensible by most humans e.g. the above example was just ONE instruction and some personal computers execute more than two billion instructions every second . See e.g. Wikipedia Instructions per second http en.wikipedia.org wiki Instructions per second as of Jun. 5 2012 21 04 GMT . Thus programs written in machine language which may be tens of millions of machine language instructions long are incomprehensible. In view of this early assembly languages were developed that used mnemonic codes to refer to machine language instructions rather than using the machine language instructions numeric values directly e.g. for performing a multiplication operation programmers coded the abbreviation mult which represents the binary number 011000 in MIPS machine code . While assembly languages were initially a great aid to humans controlling the microprocessors to perform work in time the complexity of the work that needed to be done by the humans outstripped the ability of humans to control the microprocessors using merely assembly languages.

At this point it was noted that the same tasks needed to be done over and over and the machine language necessary to do those repetitive tasks was the same. In view of this compilers were created. A compiler is a device that takes a statement that is more comprehensible to a human than either machine or assembly language such as add 2 2 and output the result and translates that human understandable statement into a complicated tedious and immense machine language code e.g. millions of 32 64 or 128 bit length strings . Compilers thus translate high level programming language into machine language.

This compiled machine language as described above is then used as the technical specification which sequentially constructs and causes the interoperation of many different computational machines such that humanly useful tangible and concrete work is done. For example as indicated above such machine language the compiled version of the higher level language functions as a technical specification which selects out hardware logic gates specifies voltage levels voltage transition timings etc. such that the humanly useful work is accomplished by the hardware.

Thus a functional operational technical description when viewed by one of skill in the art is far from an abstract idea. Rather such a functional operational technical description when understood through the tools available in the art such as those just described is instead understood to be a humanly understandable representation of a hardware specification the complexity and specificity of which far exceeds the comprehension of most any one human. With this in mind those skilled in the art will understand that any such operational functional technical descriptions in view of the disclosures herein and the knowledge of those skilled in the art may be understood as operations made into physical reality by a one or more interchained physical machines b interchained logic gates configured to create one or more physical machine s representative of sequential combinatorial logic s c interchained ordered matter making up logic gates e.g. interchained electronic devices e.g. transistors DNA quantum devices mechanical switches optics fluidics pneumatics molecules etc. that create physical reality representative of logic s or d virtually any combination of the foregoing. Indeed any physical object which has a stable measurable and changeable state may be used to construct a machine based on the above technical description. Charles Babbage for example constructed the first computer out of wood and powered by cranking a handle.

Thus far from being understood as an abstract idea those skilled in the art will recognize a functional operational technical description as a humanly understandable representation of one or more almost unimaginably complex and time sequenced hardware instantiations. The fact that functional operational technical descriptions might lend themselves readily to high level computing languages or high level block diagrams for that matter that share some words structures phrases etc. with natural language simply cannot be taken as an indication that such functional operational technical descriptions are abstract ideas or mere expressions of abstract ideas. In fact as outlined herein in the technological arts this is simply not true. When viewed through the tools available to those of skill in the art such functional operational technical descriptions are seen as specifying hardware configurations of almost unimaginable complexity.

As outlined above the reason for the use of functional operational technical descriptions is at least twofold. First the use of functional operational technical descriptions allows near infinitely complex machines and machine operations arising from interchained hardware elements to be described in a manner that the human mind can process e.g. by mimicking natural language and logical narrative flow . Second the use of functional operational technical descriptions assists the person of skill in the art in understanding the described subject matter by providing a description that is more or less independent of any specific vendor s piece s of hardware.

The use of functional operational technical descriptions assists the person of skill in the art in understanding the described subject matter since as is evident from the above discussion one could easily although not quickly transcribe the technical descriptions set forth in this document as trillions of ones and zeroes billions of single lines of assembly level machine code millions of logic gates thousands of gate arrays or any number of intermediate levels of abstractions. However if any such low level technical descriptions were to replace the present technical description a person of skill in the art could encounter undue difficulty in implementing the disclosure because such a low level technical description would likely add complexity without a corresponding benefit e.g. by describing the subject matter utilizing the conventions of one or more vendor specific pieces of hardware . Thus the use of functional operational technical descriptions assists those of skill in the art by separating the technical descriptions from the conventions of any vendor specific piece of hardware.

In view of the foregoing the logical operations functions set forth in the present technical description are representative of static or sequenced specifications of various ordered matter elements in order that such specifications may be comprehensible to the human mind and adaptable to create many various hardware configurations. The logical operations functions disclosed herein should be treated as such and should not be disparagingly characterized as abstract ideas merely because the specifications they represent are presented in a manner that one of skill in the art can readily understand and apply in a manner independent of a specific vendor s hardware implementation.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware software and or firmware implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware software and or firmware is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and or systems and or other technologies described herein can be effected e.g. hardware software and or firmware and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and or systems and or other technologies are deployed. For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle alternatively if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware in one or more machines compositions of matter and articles of manufacture limited to patentable subject matter under 35 USC 101. Hence there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and or devices and or other technologies described herein may be effected none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns e.g. speed flexibility or predictability of the implementer any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically oriented hardware software and or firmware.

In some implementations described herein logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures. Electronic circuitry for example may have one or more paths of electrical current constructed and arranged to implement various functions as described herein. In some implementations one or more media may be configured to bear a device detectable implementation when such media hold or transmit device detectable instructions operable to perform as described herein. In some variants for example implementations may include an update or modification of existing software or firmware or of gate arrays or programmable hardware such as by performing a reception of or a transmission of one or more instructions in relation to one or more operations described herein. Alternatively or additionally in some variants an implementation may include special purpose hardware software firmware components and or general purpose components executing or otherwise invoking special purpose components. Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein optionally by packet transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed media at various times.

Alternatively or additionally implementations may include executing a special purpose instruction sequence or invoking circuitry for enabling triggering coordinating requesting or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of virtually any functional operations described herein. In some variants operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence. In some contexts for example implementations may be provided in whole or in part by source code such as C or other code sequences. In other implementations source or other code implementation using commercially available and or techniques in the art may be compiled implemented translated converted into a high level descriptor language e.g. initially implementing described technologies in C or C programming language and thereafter converting the programming language implementation into a logic synthesizable language implementation a hardware description language implementation a hardware design simulation implementation and or other such similar mode s of expression . For example some or all of a logical expression e.g. computer programming language implementation may be manifested as a Verilog type hardware description e.g. via Hardware Description Language HDL and or Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Descriptor Language VHDL or other circuitry model which may then be used to create a physical implementation having hardware e.g. an Application Specific Integrated Circuit . Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain configure and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements material supplies actuators or other structures in light of these teachings.

In an embodiment computing device A may include a data anonymizer module A. In an embodiment data anonymizer module A may include irreversible anonymizer module A which generates anonymous data that is irreversible e.g. in an example the identifying data has been removed. In an embodiment data anonymizer module A may include collective anonymizer module B which may take the non anonymous data A and the non anonymous data B and create an aggregated general anonymous data as shown . In an embodiment data anonymizer module A may include reversible anonymizer module C which may use a private lookup table A to convert the non anonymous data into anonymous data. In an embodiment that private lookup table A may be stored in the data deanonymization information storing module .

Referring now to in an embodiment a computing device B may have a data anonymizer A that may apply an anonymizing function A as shown in . For example an anonymizing function may use a cryptographic method a perturbation method a DataFly algorithm top down specialization and or Mondarian multi dimensional k anonymity as non limiting and non exclusive examples. In another embodiment a data obscuring module B obscures the non anonymous data.

In an embodiment the anonymized data may be used by the service provider interface module to give data to the service provider either to carry out a portion of a service or to determine which services may be useful to one or more personal devices .

The examples shown in are merely examples of how a data anonymizer might be implemented and are not intended to be limiting or exclusive. There are many other techniques for anonymizing the data some of which will be mentioned herein.

Referring now to shows an embodiment of the invention focusing on a service provider and a computing device C. Computing device C may receive data from one or more devices and that data may be anonymized already or may not be anonymized or may already be obscured. In an embodiment computing device C may generate obscured data from the data received from one or more devices whether received directly from the one or more devices or indirectly from another source. In an embodiment Computing device C may obscure received data even if the received data is already anonymized. In another embodiment computing device C may not perform additional steps on previously anonymized or obscured data.

Referring again to in an embodiment computing device C may request one or more services that may be executed on one or more devices. The one or more services may be performed independently by the one or more devices or may be performed with facilitation of one or more portions of the services by computing device C. Computing device C may request that service provider provide one or more services that can be presented to the one or more devices. In an embodiment computing device C may transmit obscured data to service provider . This transmission may take place via any form of network e.g. communication network not pictured in . In an embodiment service provider may be integral with computing device C. In an embodiment service provider and computing device C may be under the control of a single entity.

Referring again to in an embodiment service provider may receive the obscured data . The obscured data may be in any format as described in several examples herein. The examples illustrated in and in the following figures are intended for ease of understanding only and should not be considered an exhaustive or an exclusive enumeration of ways that data may be obscured. For example in an embodiment irreversible anonymous data A may be obscured by deleting the device origin information from the data such that the data cannot be recovered using the irreversible anonymous data A. In order to obtain the original device information that formed the irreversible anonymous data A a copy of the original data may be retrieved. For example in an embodiment computing device C may store a separate copy of the data that resulted in the irreversible anonymous data A with uniquely identifying device information present in the copy kept by computing device C.

In an embodiment obscured data may include reversible anonymous data B. Data B is not limited to a particular type of format but a simple example is shown. In the example the device identifiers of the one or more personal devices A and B e.g. 00123 and 00124 are converted to new identifiers XYZ and YYZ e.g. as shown in which in an embodiment may prevent service provider from learning the identity of devices 00123 and 00124. In an embodiment reversible anonymous data B may be converted into data that uniquely identifies one or more devices through the providing of one or more algorithms lookup tables keys encryption keys hash functions and the like.

In an embodiment obscured data may include general anonymous data C. In an embodiment this type of data may include any format of aggregated data which gives information about one or more devices but does not particularly identify the one or more devices that led to the aggregate information.
