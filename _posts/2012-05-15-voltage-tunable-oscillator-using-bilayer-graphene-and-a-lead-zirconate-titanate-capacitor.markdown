The present invention relates generally to voltage tunable oscillators and more particularly to a voltage tunable oscillator using bilayer graphene and a lead zirconate titanate capacitor.

Current electronic oscillators typically utilize transistors based on the silicon germanium or III V systems coupled with silicon based MIM capacitors. These electronic oscillators however all suffer from common limitations.

One disadvantage of these previously known oscillators is that the electron mobility in these electronic transistor device systems is limited to their intrinsic values. Similarly the capacitance of the silicon based MIM Metal Insulator Metal capacitors is also limited. Together these limitations restrict the overall performance and tunability of the oscillator. Furthermore it is difficult to readily integrate both the transistors and the silicon based MIM capacitors on a single flexible substrate. This also limits the overall performance of these oscillators.

The present invention provides a voltage tunable oscillator which overcomes all of the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known devices.

In brief the oscillator of the present invention includes a substrate of a semiconductor material such as N silicon. A bilayer graphene transistor is then formed on the substrate and this graphene transistor includes two signal terminals i.e. a drain and a source on its opposite sides and a gate terminal in between.

A voltage controlled capacitor is also formed on the substrate and electrically connected to the gaphene transistor gate terminal. Preferably the capacitor comprises lead zirconate titanate PZT .

The PZT capacitor is a ferroelectric device so that the capacitance of the capacitor is varied by varying the voltage applied to the PZT capacitor. This in turn varies the oscillation frequency of the graphene transistor when excited by a single source so that the frequency of the output from the graphene transistor may be varied by varying the voltage control signal applied to the PZT capacitor.

The oscillator also includes a resonant component such as an inductor connected to both the graphene transistor and the PZT capacitor. This component together with the transistor and capacitor form a resonant circuit.

With reference first to a schematic view of the voltage controlled oscillator of the present invention is shown and includes a GFET bilayer graphene transistor having a source drain and gate . At least one and preferably two or more capacitors are disposed between the gate and drain of the transistor . In addition a resonant component such as an inductor is electrically connected between the capacitors and the transistor gate .

Still referring to the oscillator of the present invention further includes a bias resistor disposed between the transistor source and one end of the inductor . Similarly a load resistor is electrically connected between the drain and a ground . A power source is connected between the source of the transistor and ground to provide power for the oscillator.

With reference now to depicts a greatly magnified top view of the transistor while depicts a greatly magnified cross sectional view of the transistor . is not to scale.

The GFET Graphene Field Effect Transistor bilayer graphene transistor is formed by depositing a PZT layer on top of a N doped silicon substrate . A graphene layer is then deposited on top of the PZT layer . The PZT layer insulates the graphene layer from the substrate . An aluminum nitride layer is then deposited on a portion of the graphene layer while leaving the source and drain exposed. A metal gate contact is then deposited on the aluminum nitride layer so that the gate is insulated from a transistor element formed by the graphene layer by the aluminum nitride layer .

With reference now to a variable PZT capacitor is illustrated in greater detail. The capacitor includes a PZT layer attached to a silicon oxide layer over a N silicon layer by a metal layer . A variable voltage control line is insulated from the PZT layer by a metal layer . In practice by varying the voltage on the control line via a metal pad the capacitance of the capacitor is varied which in turn varies the oscillation frequency of the oscillator.

It will be understood of course that the two capacitors illustrated in are by way of example only and that a single capacitor or multiple capacitors all based on PZT or a MEMS device may be used to form the variable capacitor or .

With reference again to the resonant component or inductor as well as the biasing resistor and load resistor are all selected to form a resonant circuit when powered by the power source . Furthermore the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit may be varied by varying the capacitance of the capacitors .

With reference now to three sinusoidal graphs and are illustrated as a function of amplitude on the Y axis and time on the X axis. The three graphs and all vary in frequency and this variance in frequency is achieved by varying the voltage on the control line to the PZT capacitors .

A primary advantage of the voltage control variable oscillator of the present invention is that since the graphene transistor exhibits high electron mobility the transconductance of the transistor is also very large thus enabling efficient operation at high frequencies. Similarly the PZT MEMS capacitor as well as the capacitor exhibits an extremely high dielectric constant which enhances the overall efficiency and performance of the oscillator.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a unique voltage control oscillator that overcomes many of the disadvantages of the previously known oscillators. Having described our invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
