The conditions under which this invention was made are such as to entitle the Government of the United States under paragraph 1 a of Executive Order 10096 as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force to the entire right title and interest therein including foreign rights.

The present invention relates to magnetrons. More particularly this invention pertains to a compact conventional non relativistic magnetron suitable for numerous military and industrial applications.

The magnetron is a crossed field device in which electric fields RF and d.c. are perpendicular to a static magnetic field. It is recognized that numerous military and industrial applications exist for employing such a device capable of generating more than 1 Mega watt of RF power near L band with efficiencies of 85 percent or more.

Current commercially available magnetrons suitable for use in such critical military applications as providing countermeasures for improvised explosive devices are singularly inadequate for high microwave power more than 1 Mega watt RF output at near L band operation. For example the 100L L 3 Communications Electron Devices California Tube Laboratory is capable of only 100 kilowatt RF output near L band at 88 percent efficiency. Another device a 300L magnetron is described by Wynn et al. in an article entitled Development of a 300 kW CW L band Industrial Heating Magnetron . The 300L magnetron is capable of producing approximately 300 kilowatt RF near L band 915 MHz .

Presently no conventional magnetron input voltage less than 100 kV is capable of producing more than 1 megawatt of output power near L band approximately 912 MHz for diode voltages at or less than 45 kV with efficiencies exceeding 85 percent.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a non relativistic magnetron capable of generating greater than 1 Mega watt of RF output power near L band.

It is another object of the invention to accomplish the foregoing object at relatively low input voltage with a magnetron of compact design.

The present invention addresses shortcomings of the prior art by providing a magnetron for delivering mega watt power at a non relativistic diode voltage. Such magnetron includes an upstream coaxial waveguide comprising a central core and a surrounding exterior layer separated by an annular void defining an upstream chamber. The waveguide is electrically coupled to an adjoining downstream slow wave structure.

The slow wave structure includes a rod shaped central supporting cylinder. A helical cathode comprises fourteen turns and is coaxial with the supporting cylinder. An anode slow wave structure is coaxial with and surrounds the support and the cylinder and is separated by a void defining a downstream interaction region.

The anode structure comprises fourteen interiorly directed vanes separating and defining fourteen resonance cavities. Each of the cavities comprises a wedge portion adjoined to a neck portion.

The preceding and other features of the invention are described in the written description that follows. Such description is accompanied by a set of drawing figures. Numerals of the drawing figures corresponding to those of the written description point to the features of the invention. Like numerals refer to like features throughout both the written description and the drawings.

The present invention will be seen to provide a magnetron capable of providing megawatt power at conventional non relativistic diode voltages less than 100 kV . Previously the design of a magnetron capable of such performance was hindered by perceived difficulties. Concern about breakdown axial field stresses upon straps added to anode vanes for purposes of mode separation. An additional concern has centered about the issue of heating of the cathode. As described below the inventors have designed a magnetron that offers architecture capable of sustaining the perceived stresses and heating to accomplish megawatt power outputs at conventional diode voltages. Simulations based upon such architecture are discussed to prove the efficacy of the inventors magnetron design.

Turning now to the drawings is a side sectional view of a magnetron in accordance with the invention. A voltage potential can be applied at an upstream end that communicates with a coaxial waveguide having a cylindrical core preferably of copper or stainless steel and an exterior layer separated by an annular upstream chamber . The layer conductively coupled to a downstream anode slow wave structure discussed infra is electrically insulated from the core which is conductively connected to a helical cathode discussed infra so that the potential difference applied at the upstream end is transmitted to and serves as the diode voltage of the magnetron .

A disk shaped flange surrounds a portion of the coaxial waveguide . Such flange accommodates an interior reflector chamber of like shape that is located and dimensioned to act as a reflector of r.f. energy whereby energy is prevented from reflection out of the upstream end of the magnetron and guided to propagate toward a downstream slow wave structure . The downstream slow wave structure includes chambers that communicate with the annular upstream chamber including an upstream end cap chamber and a downstream end cap chamber separated by the interaction region .

A virtual prototype of the magnetron was configured for a performance simulation discussed below having the following parameters cathode radii major radius 2.2 cm minor radius i.e. cross sectional radius 0.386 cm distance between cathode and center support cylinder 1.2 cm and radius of center support cylinder 0.64 cm .

An anode slow wave structure surrounds the helical cathode . The slow wave structure consists of fourteen 14 vanes through that define fourteen 14 resonant cavities through . The fourteen resonant cavities through serve to reduce the phase velocity of the RF modes in the cavity. Each cavity of the slow wave structure consists of two parts. Taking the cavity as representative a first part a neck has a generally square shape while a second part comprises a wedge .

Again referring to a virtual prototype of the invention employed for the simulation to be discussed below the following dimensions were employed to define the anode slow wave structure radius of slow wave structure 3 cm radial length of a neck 0.61 cm extending from a radius of 3.04 cm to 3.65 cm azimuthal length of a neck 0.35 cm wedge radius 6.76 cm angle 22.16 degrees .

A uniform axial magnetic field prevents charged particles from immediately accelerating across the interaction region . Rather such particles undergo rotations about the cathode . If the particles azimuthal velocity component is approximately to the phase velocity of a particular electromagnetic mode in the interaction region then the possibility exists for energy exchange between the particle and the mode. Such resonance is known as the Buneman Hartee resonance condition. As the particles rotate about the cathode they gradually give up their potential energy to a mode or modes of the RF field as they migrate toward the anode slow wave structure . This is how RF oscillations are initiated in the magnetron .

Referring specifically to the straps through are run through trenches of the anode vanes that are modeled at a distance of 0.2 cm above the ends of the anode vanes. The axial length of the cathode was modeled to be 8.4 cm with a periodicity between the fourteen turns of the helical cathode being modeled to be 0.2 cm.

The entire axial length of the magnetron from left boundary of the cylindrical core to the inner surface of the downstream wall was modeled at 36.7 cm with the interior chamber that serves as an RF energy reflector located at a distance of 3.27 cm from the upstream end of the magnetron and a distance of 16.4 cm from the upstream end cap chamber .

A simulation was conducted of a magnetron in accordance with the invention utilizing design parameters as set forth above. The simulation data discussed below were created using ICEPIC Improved Concurrent Electromagnetic Particle in Cell code a numerical approach for evaluation of high power microwave tube designs. The ICEPIC algorithm solves Maxwell s equations and the relativistic Lorentz force law in the time domain on a fixed staggered grid.

For the simulations a resolution of one grid cell length was used that was equal to 0.0508 cm on a uniform Cartesian grid. With the cathode radius at 2.2 cm and the vane tips at 3.0 cm the interaction region was resolved at 16 grid cells. At this resolution the grid volume was 590 590 and 817 cells in the x y and z directions respectively yielding a total of approximately 284 million grid points. Simulations produce approximately 7 million charged micro particles requiring large high performance computing resources. The simulations of the magnetron described below were carried out on three different parallel computing platforms using 256 2.6 GHz quad core Intel Hehalem CPU s 256 2.7 GHz AMD Opteron CPU s and 256 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon CPU s. Each simulation required approximately 2.5 days to reach 1.5 s of simulation time at which time saturation was well established.

A pulsed power device was used to provide diode voltage. The circuit and switches that constitute the pulsed power device are not modeled here rather a time dependent voltage function was used to emulate the pulsed power source. The voltage function was continuous consisting of a first part a 50 ns linear ramp up followed by a second part that is a constant voltage amplitude lasting for the duration of the simulation. Voltages for the simulations ranged from 32 to 56 kV.

A uniform axial magnetic field existed for the duration of the simulations. Such field represented the insulating magnetic field that current carrying coils generate in the experiment. The coils produce a magnetic field that is uniform in the interaction region and throughout most of the magnetron.

Five sets of simulations were carried out. The magnetron was simulated at magnetic fields of 0.18 T 0.2 T 0.225 T 0.25 T and 0.275 T. The voltage range examined at each magnetic field was approximately 6 kV in 500 V increments. A total of 65 simulations were carried out.

RF output power is evaluated via the area integral of the outward Poynting flux. This integral covers all six coaxial RF outputs. This plane of integration is located at z 14.0 cm. RF output power at saturation was about 1.39 MW. Output power efficiency is defined as the ratio of radiated power to system input power. Input power is given by P IV where I is the input current supplied to the cathode and V is the upstream diode voltage. This current is calculated by performing a closed path line integral of the magnetic field around the area in which the current is flowing to determine the current and integrating the electric field radially to determine the voltage. For the simulation RF power efficiency was 87.1 percent with an input current of 38.5 A and a measured voltage of 41.4 kV. There was no downstream leakage current. For a strapped magnetron operating at the MW power level there is concern about breakdown due to field stress. The Kilpatrick limit for breakdown in a magnetron using a copper anode operating at 912 MHz is approximately 284 kV cm. A survey of electrical field data at saturation throughout the volume of the magnetron indicates that the critical location for breakdown is the downstream straps. Consequently a thorough examination of field stresses at this location was carried out. Field stress data at the straps was produced at every time step for two different times and extending over 50 oscillatory periods during saturation one starting at 800 ns and the other at 850 ns. Results indicate that the axial electric field component peaks at 259 kV cm and that the radial electric field component peaks at 346 kV cm. It should be noted that the axial magnetic field of B 0.2 T will act to insulate any charge flow along this direction easily mitigating breakdown. 

The V 42 kV at B 0.2 T simulation ran at 87.1 percent efficiency most of the remaining energy went into heating both the cathode and the anode slow wave structure. Simulations were equipped with diagnostic capability to record the kinetic energy of charged particles upon their impact with the cathode anode slow wave structure or upstream downstream structure. Impact data was taken during saturation at 850 ns at each time step over one cycle to yield an approximate result for the character of energy deposition at saturation. Power loss to the cathode via back bombardment is approximately 3.4 percent of the total input power i.e. approximately 53 kV . The heat burden may be mitigated by operating at a 5 percent duty cycle in which case 2.65 kW heating results. Analysis indicates that a Tungsten cathode is capable of supporting this magnitude of heating. Power loss due to collisions with the anode slow wave structure is approximately 101 kW or 6.3 percent of input power. At a 5 percent duty cycle this yields approximately 5 kW a rate of heating this is readily addressed by external cooling mechanisms.

The described simulation is representative of a battery of runs performed from B 0.18 T to B 0.275 T. A minor degree of mode competition present at startup which may occur between 350 and 700 ns is well on its way to decay once mode saturation has been reached. The simulated magnetron operated in accordance with the Buneman Hartee resonance condition. Operation was robust and predictable over the range of magnetic fields and voltages sampled. The voltage window for mode oscillation for a given magnetic field was approximately 6 kV which advances performance stability.

Heating of the cathode and anode was measured at saturation for all simulations. For clarity the simulation data for only the B 0.18 and B 0.275 T are illustrated in a graph illustrating energy loss in simulations of a magnetron in accordance with the invention. The two sets of simulations represent the minimum and maximum values for both cathode and anode heating. As with the reference simulation heating rates were determined by calculation of energy loss due to particle collisions with the anode slow wave structure and the cathode. Diagnostics were placed around the slow wave structure and the cathode for recording particle kinetic energy upon collision with the slow wave structure. Separate diagnostics were put in place so that particle kinetic energy could be recorded when the particle was back scattered into the cathode. Cathode heating ranged from about 10 kW at B 0.18 T to 66 kW at B 0.275 T. Heating of the slow wave structure ranged from about 1 kW to about 100 kW both for B 0.275. The great variation in heating for a given magnetic field as the voltage is increased is to be expected due to the smaller number of particles impacting the anode slow wave structure at lower voltage. No downstream current loss was detected in any of the simulations.

The magnetron consistently oscillated in simulation in the mode across a wide range of magnetic fields and voltages. It operated in a predictable fashion obeying the Buneman Hartree resonance condition. The mode resonance curve was used to successfully predict where in voltage magnetic field space the magnetron would oscillate i.e. oscillations tracked well with the curve .

Thus it is seen that the present invention provides a high efficiency 87 percent conventional megawatt class magnetron. The magnetron has been demonstrated in simulation to be capable of supporting mode oscillations over a 6 kV wide window absent any significant mode competition at output RF power levels that exceed 1 MW for voltages lower than 40 kV. No downstream current loss occurred and RF field amplitudes do not exceed the vacuum breakdown threshold. A magnetron capable of generating over a megawatt of RF output power near L band at 87 percent efficiency for diode voltages below 45 kV due to its high output power and minimum voltage requirements allows the delivery of microwave induced effects over a much wider range of space than otherwise provided in the art.

While this invention has been described with reference to its presently preferred embodiment it is not limited thereto. Rather the invention is limited only insofar as it is defined by the following set of patent claims and includes within its scope all equivalents thereof.
