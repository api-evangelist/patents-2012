Facilities e.g. buildings departments warehouses plants factories refineries airports laboratories mines etc. can have various operational systems associated therewith. Operational systems can be and or include for example fire safety systems heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems security systems access control systems and or energy management systems among other types of systems.

Monitoring various aspects of such a system may allow for increased efficiency effectiveness and or satisfaction of various personnel e.g. operators managers chief security officers CSOs etc. associated with the system for instance. Monitoring may include gathering various data associated with a system though previous approaches may be ineffective with respect to measures such as for example interpreting and or summarizing such data.

Methods systems and computer readable media for providing an operational dashboard are described herein. For example one or more embodiments include receiving operational data associated with a system receiving credentials associated with a user of a user device including a number of display elements configurable by the user and determining a particular portion of the operational data to provide to the user via the display elements of the user device based at least in part on the credentials.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide for a unified interest layer referred to herein as a dashboard allowing at a glance views of various aspects e.g. performance indicators statistics analytics and or metrics associated with an operational e.g. working system. Systems as used herein can refer to various systems including for example fire safety systems heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems security systems access control systems and or energy management systems among other types of systems. In a general sense dashboards of the present disclosure can display data associated with the various aspects of such systems herein referred to as information in and or as summaries trends comparisons and or exceptions among other ways of displaying information.

Embodiments of the present disclosure can receive e.g. gather data from a number of systems and display information in various displays determined based on an identity and or role of a user for instance. Embodiments of the present disclosure can display a dashboard on various user devices including by way of example and not limitation desktop computers laptop computers tablets smart phones and or personal digital assistants PDAs for instance. Further embodiments of the present disclosure can display dashboards on various computing and or device platforms e.g. operating systems .

Accordingly embodiments of the present disclosure can provide various users e.g. operators managers chief security officers CSOs etc. easily viewable and easily understandable information associated with the various systems described herein. Such users can use the provided information to make more informed and or higher level decisions than by using previous approaches. For example managers can use such information to make decisions regarding contracts purchases and or personnel management among other decisions.

Dashboards in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure can include a number of display elements sometimes referred to herein as widgets. Widgets in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure can include software accessories for providing e.g. displaying various information associated with various aspects of systems such as those previously discussed.

Widgets can interact with remote sources of information such as servers e.g. computing device discussed below in connection with to provide information. Widgets can be used to access various pages e.g. html webpages . Widgets can be interactive so that a user performs common input operations e.g. clicking a mouse typing on a keyboard touching a screen to utilize the functionality of a widget.

Dashboards e.g. widgets of a dashboard in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure can be user configurable. A user can interact with and or configure widgets as desired for instance. In some embodiments a user can move widgets around the display and or can resize widgets if applicable. In various embodiments some widgets may be resizable and some may be of fixed size. Some widgets can automatically resize themselves based on the amount or nature of the information being displayed.

In some embodiments widgets may overlap one another. In some embodiments widgets do not overlap one another if a user attempts to move one widget to the position occupied by another widget one of the widgets may automatically move out of the way to make room.

In various embodiments position s configuration s and or size s of widgets can be saved when the dashboard is dismissed so that the same state can be restored the next time the dashboard is invoked. Various embodiments allow a user to manipulate adjust and or otherwise personalize particular information included in dashboards and or widgets in accordance with the present disclosure.

Personalization of displayed information may be determined and or limited by a user s role e.g. identity . For example a high level user e.g. a CSO may desire higher level summarized information e.g. summarized monthly . Higher level information can include for example monthly spending associated with a security system. A lower level user e.g. a team manager may desire lower level information e.g. current and or real time information . Lower level information can include for example current locations of employees and or access devices e.g. cards .

Display of information to a particular user can therefore be determined based on a role of the user. The role can be determined based upon user input of credentials and or authentication information e.g. log in .

Dashboards can be overlaid on an existing desktop user interface of a user device for instance. The user interface can be darkened brightened blurred distorted or otherwise altered so as to emphasize that it is temporarily inactivated. The existing desktop can be visible behind the dashboard. In some embodiments the existing desktop is not visible while the dashboard is active. In some embodiments the desktop can be shrunk to a small portion of the screen while the dashboard is active and can be reactivated by various user inputs.

A number of embodiments of the present disclosure can include the capability to alert a user when a widget needs attention or has new information to display to the user even if the dashboard is not currently active. For example if a particular portion of security data e.g. alarm activations per week exceeds a particular threshold e.g. 100 activations a user may be alerted. A distinctive sound can be played a dialog box can be presented and or a text alert can be displayed. Such alerts can be of a generalized type may indicate the specific widget that issued the alert and or can display additional information specifying the nature of the alert. The user can then activate the dashboard to see the widget that issued the alert for instance. Alternatively the dashboard can automatically be activated in such a situation or a dialog box can be presented to allow the user to indicate whether or not the dashboard should be activated.
