Various devices such as computers tablets phones etc. include memory that may be at times insufficient. Devices that rely on random access memory RAM may or may not have other types of memory or storage to alleviate issues stemming from insufficient RAM. For example many computers include a hard drive whether a disk drive or a solid state drive that can be used for writing information from RAM to free up some of the RAM. One memory management process is referred to as paging which involves storing information from RAM as main memory or primary memory to a secondary storage or a tertiary storage in the form of pages . Paging may be part of a virtual memory strategy for managing memory of a device. Paging performs tasks such as book keeping page in to transfer a page from a drive to RAM and page out to transfer a page from RAM to the drive . Such tasks require time and place demands on resources which may diminish user experience or more generally performance of a device e.g. latency of a drive may be several orders of magnitude greater than latency of RAM . As described herein various technologies techniques etc. can monitor memory and optionally issue notifications for example to enhance user experience device performance etc.

A method can include receiving memory configuration information that specifies a memory configuration receiving memory usage information for the memory configuration analyzing the received memory usage information for a period of time and responsive to the analyzing controlling notification circuitry configured to display a graphical user interface that presents information for physically altering the specified memory configuration. Various other apparatuses systems methods etc. are also disclosed.

The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the implementations. The scope of the described implementations should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims.

Various technologies techniques etc. are described herein that pertain to memory for a device such as a notebook computer a tablet a smart phone etc. As an example a method can include receiving memory configuration information that specifies a memory configuration of a device receiving memory usage information for the memory configuration of the device analyzing the received memory usage information for a period of time and responsive to such analyzing controlling notification circuitry configured to display a graphical user interface that presents information for physically altering a specified memory configuration of the device. Such a method may notify a user e.g. by issuing a notification that more memory could improve performance of the device for example based on actual memory usage.

As an example of a scenario where the aforementioned method may find benefit consider a device that includes the WINDOWS Task Manager an application included with some WINDOWS operating systems OSs that provides information about computer performance running applications processes CPU usage commit charge memory network activity and statistics logged in users and system services. If the device is using most of its available memory its OS will typically release memory by writing the least used memory contents to a pagefile on a drive e.g. secondary storage etc. . As memory is required the pagefile is again written to. As mentioned paging tends to cause a degradation of system performance e.g. where drive I O is much less efficient than RAM I O . Further as virtual memory address space is mapped to physical memory on demand RAM tends to appear fully utilized according to the Task Manager application e.g. all the time . Under such circumstances the aforementioned method may acquire memory usage information e.g. using a threshold that is less than a paging threshold analyze the information and based on such an analysis issue a notification to inform a user or other that physically altering device memory may be beneficial. In other words a user would not need to invoke and decipher information presented by the Task Manager application e.g. the Task Manager GUI in an attempt to determine whether adding more physical memory would be possible or beneficial. Such a method may optionally be implemented in situations where paging has been disabled e.g. no page file exists .

As an example a method may include implementing a performance monitoring tool of an OS e.g. consider the WINDOWS Performance Monitor which can examine how programs affect performance both in real time and by collecting log data for later analysis . In such an example the method may cause the tool to start a data collection routine that monitors available bytes in memory to log an event when the available bytes are less than X e.g. 10 or other value of the total memory available and to log an event when the available bytes are greater than Y e.g. 10 or other value . The tool or the method may provide for time stamping of log events e.g. a time value . Given such memory usage information the method can determine how long a low memory situation existed. Further after having multiple occasions of a low memory situation s or for example after deciding longevity e.g. duration of a low memory situation s the method can issue an alert for example to inform a user that adding more memory is likely to be beneficial.

As a specific example consider a WINDOWS OS that includes the WINDOWS Management Instrumentation WMI infrastructure for management of data and operations. The WMI infrastructure allows for execution of scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks on local or remote computers and to supply management data to other parts of the OS. In this particular example a method can include executing a script application etc. for obtaining total physical memory values and taking a selected threshold e.g. 85 as a value for purposes of monitoring. The method may periodically sample available memory e.g. via a monitoring tool within the WMI infrastructure to monitor when memory utilization exceeds the selected threshold. The method may instruct the infrastructure to log an event when the threshold is exceeded e.g. capturing at least the time and optionally a date . The method may include analyzing logged events for example based on a number of events over a time interval duration of exceeded thresholds over a given time etc. and issuing a notification via an interface e.g. video sound vibration electronic communication etc. that indicates that adding more memory will improve system performance.

At time the user has loaded one or more applications and data from storage such as the storage for execution by the device . The one or more applications and data may be invoked as single instances multiple instances etc. as represented by various user interfaces UIs on the display of the device . For example the user may invoke a browser application that loads large video files via the Internet where the browser application has a video plug in for performing decoding of compressed video files for rendering to a display of the device . As another example the user may invoke a game application that renders detailed three dimensional scenes at a high frame rate. Such processes may be resource intensive and cause the device to use most of its RAM and to implement paging e.g. writing information from the RAM to the storage . As indicated the user may become frustrated by the performance of the device as videos glitch a game stutters etc. Such issues may stem from paging especially where paging has led to excessive drive fragmentation e.g. use of a device with insufficient memory can over time compound performance problems .

At time the user who knows a little about computers resorts to invoking a task manager application e.g. entering a CTRL ALT DEL key command and selecting Start Task Manager . Clicking on a Performance tab the application renders a GUI to the display . The user with his little knowledge is confused as he cannot decipher the various types of memory or what they mean in terms of the poor performance experienced at time . For example the user may think What does Physical Memory 71 mean or Seems like I have adequate memory available . Given his limited knowledge the user does not readily know what to do to address the poor performance experience.

The method if implemented in the scenario of may provide the user with a report for example by displaying a graphical user interface that presents information for physically altering a specified memory configuration. shows an example of such a report or notification in the form of a graphical user interface GUI .

The GUI is shown as a 2 D visual rendering as may appear on a screen e.g. display projection etc. based for example on instructions in a mark up language e.g. HTML or other format. Such instructions may optionally adhere to a style sheet language e.g. CSS . As an example data logic instructions etc. may be determined by the report block to cause rendering of the GUI which may render image data graphics via graphics processing etc.

In the example of the GUI includes various fields or graphics which may optionally respond to user input e.g. via a pointing device voice command touch etc. . For example the GUI includes various navigation graphics e.g. where a System graphic is active a search field an informational graphic a system information graphic a field indicating a general assessment e.g. You have enough memory a field for installed and maximum memory graphics for memory slot information a field for information as to memory slots e.g. you can replace the memory in this slot up to 8 GB and a graphic with one or more selectable options . In the example of the option Optimize is selected and a field presented with information as to optimizing performance e.g. try closing some programs that you are not using . As shown other options include a memory upgrade option e.g. Get more memory and an information option e.g. Tips .

As an example notification circuitry e.g. report circuitry of may be configured to display the GUI which presents information for physically altering a specified memory configuration. In this example a specified memory configuration may be Slot 4 GB and Slot 4 GB . Information for physically altering a specified memory configuration may be for example cannot alter at maximum capacity replace memory in Slot X or Y with Z GB insert memory in empty Slot X replace memory in Slots X and Y with Z GB etc.

In the example of the memory upgrade option may upon selection initiate Internet navigation to a website where appropriate memory may be purchased ordered etc. For example upon selection of the memory upgrade option information may be communicated to an Internet store and input into an application programming interface of the Internet store search engine etc. such that the Internet navigation navigates to a webpage of the Internet store that includes information for one or more memories that would be appropriate for memory upgrade. Further such a method may include manufacturer information for the device e.g. the notebook computer or other information e.g. a valued customer ID that can apply a coupon discount program award etc. for purchase of memory. Accordingly report circuitry e.g. for notification may transmit information via an Internet connection to assist a user in purchasing memory for example in response to a determination that more memory could enhance performance. As an example a GUI may include an option for a user to input one or more credentials favorite vendors website URLs etc. to assist a user in enhancing performance of her device e.g. Support option may provide one or more fields controls etc. that allow a user to input discover authorize etc. appropriate information actions etc. . As an example a GUI may optionally display advertisements coupons etc. for purchase of memory where activating a link e.g. clicking on a graphic navigates to an Internet store.

As to the memory management modules these may include a logic module a message module a time module e.g. optionally for date as well as time a user module a UI module a communication module a storage module and one or more other modules . Referring to the circuitry e.g. and may optionally include one or more of the modules . Such modules may also include script code etc. that can invoke one or more classes e.g. using one or more properties to cause monitoring analyzing reporting notifying etc. As an example where a device is used by more than one user by invoking a class that includes a User property memory usage information may be analyzed reported etc. on a user by user basis. Consider a brother User and a sister User where the sister plays a game that demands a lot of memory. An analysis may determine that User is using much more memory than User and issue a report via email to a responsible parent that the device could benefit from a memory upgrade or that User should consider using a different device e.g. where its memory is at capacity .

The analysis circuitry can include one or more of a history module a manufacturing module a logic module and an application information module . Such modules may be implemented to analyze the data optionally providing additional data. For example the history module may include memory data and system data . The manufacturer module may include information as to patches e.g. BIOS OS etc. and knowledge base KB information which may indicate types of memory usage issues and possible solutions or tips to improve performance. Further the manufacturer module may provide information as to resetting one or more settings associated with the analysis circuitry in response to a change in configuration of physical memory of a device. Such information may optionally be provided or determined for example via access to system information and comparing system information to stored information for the system to determine if a change has occurred.

The logic module may include logic for memory issues and learning logic e.g. to learn from user selections user usage of a device etc. . As an example the learning logic may learn that memory usage impacts performance when a user uses an application X and an application Y concurrently. Such logic may allow the analysis circuitry to determine that memory usage will not impact performance if the user uses only one of these applications at a time. In turn the report circuitry may issue a notification that notifies the user to use only one of application X or application Y at a time to improve performance e.g. as a tip .

As to the application information module such information may include memory leak information and settings information . For example various web browser applications have been known to experience memory leakage e.g. memory not released after usage excessive caching etc. . Such memory leaks can at times consume a gigabyte or more of memory. Where the analysis circuitry has access to such information it may inform the report circuitry to report the application to a user e.g. application Z has memory leak issues settings XY recommended . In such a manner the analysis circuitry may ascertain whether a memory usage pattern trend etc. is actually due to an application or improper settings with respect to an application.

As indicated the report circuitry may include capabilities to report locally remotely or both locally and remotely . As an example the report circuitry may be configured as a background process where reporting to a user s device is disabled and where reports are issued to a manufacturer e.g. where a manufacturer monitoring option has been accepted by a user or owner of a device . As an example of both local and remote reporting consider a GUI rendered to a display of the device and an email sent to the owner or user of the device. Such reporting may occur relatively simultaneously or may occur at different times. For example a GUI may be rendered once an issue is uncovered by an analysis and an email may be sent if the issue occurs one or more subsequent times e.g. please note that a memory usage trend exists that may be addressed by doing XYZ .

In the example of the classifications include insignificant download OS patches intermittent persistent high frequency intermittent and low frequency intermittent . To classify the classification block may combine time of day and memory usage pattern. For example during the time period of 03 00 00 to 6 00 00 which is in the middle of the night the memory usage pattern shows that memory usage exceed a threshold for a period of fifteen minutes. Logic e.g. programmed learned etc. may determine that such activity is likely to be associated with installation of one or more OS patches. Accordingly the classification block may classify that activity as being related to download of OS patches which does not require triggering of any reporting e.g. Trigger N . As to high frequency intermittent at time period 12 00 00 to 15 00 00 this corresponds to 41 events up and down for a total time of 85 minutes e.g. about half of the entire 180 minute time period . As the memory usage on average was percent this activity is classified as being of the type to trigger reporting e.g. Trigger Y . The other type classified as triggering reporting is persistent which corresponds to the time period 09 00 00 to 12 00 00 where although few events the time is 124 minutes which is a large fraction of the 180 minute time period.

As to analysis of memory usage information a method may include analyzing such information for a period of time for example by utilizing a calculation involving an exceed time and the period of time e.g. a monitoring period where the exceed time is the amount of time that memory usage exceeds a threshold. As to a period of time it may be as an example greater than or equal to two days. A period of time may optionally be determined by a method that aims to distinguish a regular day or days off etc. Further a method may optionally distinguish work time leisure time etc. For example a user may use certain applications at work and other applications at home. For some users home usage may be more demanding on memory than work usage e.g. where home usage includes videos games etc. . A method may optionally indicate for example that usage during after work hours would benefit from a memory upgrade e.g. a notification that reports with respect to time of day or other trend detail .

As described herein a method may include analyzing memory usage information by utilizing a calculation involving an exceed amount where the exceed amount is the amount by which memory usage exceeds a threshold. In such an example if a threshold is set to 50 of total installed memory the exceed amount may range from about 51 to about 100 . A method may optionally include an upper value where memory usage above that value is no longer distinguished e.g. once usage reaches higher values of 96 to 100 may be regarded as having less informational value . As another example an exceed amount scheme may optionally be tiered e.g. from 0 10 over threshold from 11 20 over threshold etc. .

As described herein a device system etc. may include analysis circuitry to analyze memory usage information for a period of time for example by utilizing a calculation involving an exceed time and the period of time where the exceed time is the amount of time that memory usage exceeds a threshold. In such an example the period of time may be on the order of two or more days. As another example a device a system etc. may include analysis circuitry to utilize a calculation involving an exceed amount where the exceed amount is the amount by which memory usage exceeds a threshold.

While various examples are described with respect to a device such as a notebook computer devices such as smart devices cell phones tablets etc. may also provide for monitoring and one or more memory upgrade options for example by including or operating in conjunction with circuitry such as the circuitry and . Such circuitry may optionally be consolidated locally or remotely or distributed locally remotely or locally and remotely.

As described herein a method can include receiving memory configuration information that specifies a memory configuration receiving memory usage information for the memory configuration analyzing the received memory usage information for a period of time and responsive to the analyzing controlling notification circuitry configured to display a graphical user interface that presents information for physically altering a specified memory configuration.

As described herein a method can include controlling notification circuitry by issuing an instruction to display a memory upgrade option via a graphical user interface. In such an example the memory upgrade option may include replacing memory of the memory configuration adding memory without replacing memory of the memory configuration or other option. Further more than one option may be provided for example by issuing an instruction to display an additional memory upgrade option via the graphical user interface or other mechanism.

As described herein one or more computer readable media can include processor executable instructions to instruct a computer to receive memory configuration information that specifies a memory configuration of the computer receive memory usage information for the memory configuration of the computer and responsive to an analysis of the received memory usage information for a period of time control notification circuitry configured to optionally display information for upgrading a memory configuration of the device.
