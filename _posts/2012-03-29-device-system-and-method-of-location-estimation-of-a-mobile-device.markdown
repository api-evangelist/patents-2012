This application is a National Phase Application of PCT International Application No. PCT US2012 031318 International Filing Date Mar. 29 2012 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

An application executed by a mobile device may use location data received from one or more location data origin transmitters to determine an estimated location of the mobile device. For example a road navigation application may use location data which may be received for example from one or more satellites of a Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS .

Some of the location data e.g. location fix fix data may have a relatively low level of accuracy e.g. an accuracy of about 5 200 meters. For example the low level of accuracy may result from satellite geometry satellite orbit clock error and the like.

The application may use local error correction methods which may be executed by the application. For example the road navigation application may receive the location fix data from the GNSS system and may utilize a local error correction method which may compare the location fix data to a geographical database in order to determine inconsistency. For example the error corrector may assume that the mobile device is in a vehicle which is assumed to be on a road. If the location fix data does not position the mobile device on the road for example on a field or in an offset from the road the error corrector of the application may correct the location fix to be on the road.

In some demonstrative embodiments the term wireless device may be used to provide a wireless service.

Reference is now made to which schematically illustrates a block diagram of a wireless communication system in accordance with some demonstrative embodiments.

In some demonstrative embodiments system may include a wireless communication device capable of receiving wireless communication signals including location information related to a location of device . Device may receive location information over a wireless communication medium e.g. via one or more antennas .

In some demonstrative embodiments wireless medium may include for example a Radio Frequency RF channel a WiFi channel a Bluetooth channel a cellular channel a GNSS Channel a NFC channel an audio channel a video channel and the like.

In some demonstrative embodiments system may include at least one device configured to transmit the wireless communication signals including location information via one or more antennas .

For example device may include one or more of a location data origin transmitter e.g. satellites of the GNSS one or more Wireless Fidelity WiFi hotspots or AP s one or more Bluetooth devices one or more cellular devices one or more NFC devices and the like.

In some demonstrative embodiments antennas and or may include any type of antennas suitable for transmitting and or receiving wireless communication signals blocks frames transmission streams packets messages and or data. Types of antennas that may be used for antennas and or may include but are not limited to internal antenna dipole antenna omni directional antenna a monopole antenna an end fed antenna a circularly polarized antenna a micro strip antenna a diversity antenna a phase array antenna and the like. In some embodiments antennas and or may implement transmit and receive functionalities using separate transmit and receive antenna elements. In some embodiments antennas and or may implement transmit and receive functionalities using common and or integrated transmit receive elements.

In some demonstrative embodiments location information may be related for example to a location of device and or to a relative location between device and device .

In some demonstrative embodiments device may receive location information and may determine a location of device based on location information .

In some demonstrative embodiments device may include at least one location information generator configured to provide location information indicating an estimated location of device based on location information . For example location information generator may estimate the location of device based on the location of device for example by calculating a relative location between device and device .

In some demonstrative embodiments location information generator may include one or more of a GNSS receiver configured to estimate the location of device based on location information received from at least one GNSS device e.g. satellites a WiFi location information generator configured to estimate the location of device based on location information received from at least one WiFi device e.g. a WiFi hot spot or AP a Bluetooth location information generator configured to estimate the location of device based on location information received from at least one BT device a NFC location information generator configured to estimate the location of device based on location information received from at least one NFC device a microphone based location information generator a camera based location information generator a sensor based location information generator a cellular location information generator configured to estimate the location of device based on location information received from at least one cellular device e.g. a cellular antenna and or cellular operator and the like 

In some demonstrative embodiments application may be implemented as part of an Operating System OS of device as part of a real time operating system e.g. an ARM Real Time Operating System ARTOS or as another application with or without an OS.

In some demonstrative embodiments application may use and or process location information . For example application may be a road terrain navigation application which may use location information in order to navigate a vehicle on a road terrain. In another example application may be a consumer application a social application an entertainment application a sport application e.g. a running application a bicycle tour application and the like a location based recommendation application e.g. a restaurant recommendation application a touristic location recommendation application an entertainment recommendation application and the like a tracking application e.g. a fleet management application a delivery management application a transportation management application and the like.

In some demonstrative embodiments location information e.g. as estimated by location information generator may have a relatively low level of accuracy due to various reasons.

In one example location information may have a relatively low level of accuracy due to satellite geometry e.g. a relative position between satellites as viewed by GNSS receiver . For example when GNSS receiver views the satellites clustered in a certain area it may be difficult to estimate an accurate location of GNSS receiver whereas when the satellites are distributed over a wide area the estimated location of GNSS receiver may be more accurate.

In another example location information may have a relatively low level of accuracy due to atmospheric effects. For example the troposphere and ionosphere may affect the propagation speed of the GNSS satellite signals which may affect the calculation of the estimated location by GNSS receiver .

In yet another example location information may have a relatively low level of accuracy due to reflections of GNSS satellite signals from objects e.g. buildings and the like which may cause several of the GNSS satellite signals to reach GNSS receiver at different times and may affect the calculation of the estimated location.

In some demonstrative embodiments device may be configured to correct location information independently of application e.g. as described below.

In some demonstrative embodiments device may include a location error corrector configured to provide location data to application . Location data may indicate an estimated location of device which is based on the location information from location information generator . Location error corrector may receive from application error feedback information indicating an error in the estimated location may determine a correction based on error feedback information and may provide to application corrected location data based on the correction e.g. as described in detail below.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may determine location data indicating the estimated location of device based on location information received from location information generator .

In some demonstrative embodiments application may include a location Error Detector ED configured to detect errors in location data .

In some demonstrative embodiments error detector may detect the errors in the estimated location of device based on one or more location error detection methodologies. For example application may include a database DB including maps and or other geographical data e.g. information relating to buildings roads areas of interest and the like. Error detector may access DB and may map the estimated location of device into a corresponding location in a map of DB e.g. to determine a map fix and may look for inconsistencies between the map fix and the geographical data.

For example device may be a mobile device e.g. a GPS Mobile device residing in a vehicle and application may be a road navigation application. Accordingly error detector may include an algorithm which may assume that the estimated location of device should be most of the time on a road. If the map fix of device is not determined to be on a road e.g. on a river field or in a distance from a road error detector may detect an error in the estimated location of device .

In some demonstrative embodiments application may include an application Error Corrector EC configured to estimate and evaluate the detected errors in the estimated location of device and to correct the errors accordingly. For example error corrector may identify that error detector is repeatedly detecting the same error in the estimated location of device for example indicating that a map fix is not on a road e.g. in a distance from a road. Error corrector may estimate and evaluate the error and for example if the repeated error is in a constant offset from the road error corrector may correct the estimated location of device e.g. by correcting the constant offset and adjusting the map fix in order to place device on the road.

In some demonstrative embodiments application may determine error feedback information including information indicating the error in the estimated location of device . For example error feedback information may include a detected error in the estimated location of device e.g. as detected by error detector or an estimated error e.g. as estimated by error corrector .

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may process error feedback information and may determine e.g. based on error feedback information an error correction configured to overcome the detected error.

In one example location error corrector may detect an error in the GNSS system indicating that a satellite may not be in a location reported by the satellite. Accordingly location error corrector may modify a long term ephemerides parameter of GNSS location information generator e.g. by modifying values indicating estimated positions along an orbit of the satellite.

In another example location error corrector may detect an error caused by atmosphere layers e.g. according to whether conditions solar conditions and the like. Accordingly location error corrector may estimate delays caused by the atmosphere layers and may take into consideration the delays when calculating the estimated location of device .

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may include a DB configured to store information which may be relevant to correct the estimated location of device . For example DB may store the error correction parameters which may be relevant to the estimated location of device . For example DB may store modified values of positions of a satellite having an ephemerides error.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may control location information generator based on the error correction. For example error corrector may modify one or parameters of location information generator e.g. the long term ephemerides parameter of GNSS receiver .

In some demonstrative embodiments location information generator may include two or more location information generators. For example two or more of GNSS receiver WiFi location information generator Bluetooth location information generator NFC location information generator cellular location information generator and the like.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may rank a reliability of the location information generators based on error feedback information and may determine location information based on the ranking.

For example location error corrector may rank the reliability of GNSS receiver WiFi location information generator Bluetooth location information generator NFC location information generator and or cellular location information generator . For example location error corrector may assign a first high reliability ranking to a location information generator having a low rate of errors and a second low reliability ranking which is lesser than the first reliability ranking to a location information generator having a high rate of errors.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may determine the estimated location of device based on a first location information generator e.g. GNSS receiver having the high reliability ranking. Location error corrector may switch to use a second different location information generator e.g. BT location information generator if a reliability ranking of the second location information generator becomes higher than the reliability ranking of the first location information generator.

In another example location error corrector may determine the estimated location of device based on a combination of the location information from two or more location information generators. In one example location error corrector may combine the location information according to the reliability ranking. For example location error corrector may select two location information generators e.g. GNSS receiver and WiFi location information generator having the highest reliability ranking and may determine the estimated location of device based on a combination of the location information received from the two selected location information generators e.g. by applying a weighted average to the location information received from the two selected location information generators.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may determine corrected location data based on the error correction. For example location error corrector may modify the map location fix of device according to the error correction.

In some demonstrative embodiments at least one application may include at least first and second applications. Location error corrector may receive error feedback information from the first application and may provide to the second application corrected location based on error feedback information .

In one example the first application may be capable of detecting errors in location information while the second application may not be capable of detecting the errors. For example the first application may include a road navigation application and the second application may include a social application which may not have location error detections and error corrections capabilities. In another example the second application may be at a power save mode which may not enable determining the errors. The first application may send error feedback information to location error corrector location error corrector may determine a correction based on error feedback information from the first application and may provide corrected location data to be utilized by the second application.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may cause application to wake up from a power save mode to provide error feedback information and to return back to the power save mode. For example application may include a map DB and location error corrector may wake up application in order to map location information from location information generator into a corresponding map location in the map DB to check for inconsistencies between the map fix and the map DB and to provide error feedback information . For example location error corrector may use error feedback information in order to check a reliability of location information generator .

In some demonstrative embodiments device may utilize an interface in order to communicate and to transfer data between one or more elements of device e.g. application and location error corrector .

For example device may include an Application Programming Interface API configured to transfer data between application and location error corrector . For example API may transfer location data from location error corrector to application error feedback information from application to location error corrector and corrected location data from location error corrector to application .

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may improve an accuracy of the estimated location of device for example by ranking the plurality of location information generators by using a combination of one or more location information generators and or by modifying the parameters of location information generator e.g. as described above.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may store in DB information relating to a position of location data origin transmitter e.g. a satellite. Location error corrector may utilize the stored information to determine a position of location data origin transmitter during an acquisition and tracking of location data origin transmitter . Accordingly location error corrector may use more accurate information on the position of location data origin transmitter to reduce an acquisition time of location data origin transmitter and or to reduce a search interval which may be used to track location data origin transmitter .

For example location error corrector may store in DB one or more parameters e.g. long term ephemerides relating to a position of a satellite indicating a location of the satellite along a satellite orbit which may give better and accurate estimation on the position of the satellite.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may improve a power utilization of device due to the reduced acquisition time and the reduced search interval.

In some demonstrative embodiments location error corrector may perform some of the operations performed by application e.g. location error detection and correction. Accordingly location error corrector may enable application to be in the power save mode for a longer period of time.
