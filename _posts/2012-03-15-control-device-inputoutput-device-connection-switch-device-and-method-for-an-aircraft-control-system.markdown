This is a continuation of International Application No. PCT EP2010 063376 filed Sep. 13 2010 which claims priority to German Application No. 10 2009 041 599.8 filed Sep. 15 2009 and also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 242 620 filed Sep. 15 2009 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The technical field relates to aircraft technology and in particular a signal transmission device for exchanging signals between systems or devices in an aircraft. Furthermore the technical field relates to a control device for an aircraft network a method for controlling an aircraft network an input output device for an aircraft network a method for identifying an input output device a connection switching device a method for identifying an input output device in a connection switching device and a program element for carrying out the methods.

In an aircraft for example in an Airbus A380 a network may be installed which may connect various devices with each other within the aircraft. Such an aircraft network may be denoted as ADCN Aircraft Data Communication Network . Various devices which may comprise a processing unit with its own software and its own processor may be connected to such a network. These devices may be denoted as CPIOM Core Processing Input Output Module .

The processing units or CPIOMs may carry out different programs or applications simultaneously. The respective program software for the application may be loaded manually through the network ADCN after the installation of the processing unit in the aircraft i.e. after the processing unit has been integrated into the network. The software which is loaded onto the corresponding CPIOMs may be taken from storage. Alternatively a processing unit CPIOM may be stored with pre installed software and the software may be pre loaded in the workshop or may be loaded into or onto the CPIOM.

The storage of pre installed CPIOM modules may make it necessary for a number of different processing units or CPIOMs to stored which due to the different software may also comprise different item numbers or part numbers. For example one aircraft may have seven different processing units and thus seven different part numbers. Because of the pre configuration the processing units of the CPIOMs may not be interchangeable.

In view of the foregoing there may at least a need for providing an efficient operating of an aircraft network. In addition other needs desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.

According to an embodiment a control device is provided for an aircraft network a method is provided for controlling an aircraft network an input output device is provided for an aircraft network a method is provided for identifying an input output device a connection switching device a method for identifying an input output device and a program element are provided in accordance with embodiments.

According to an embodiment the control device for an aircraft network may comprise an application determination device and an application provision device. The application determination device may be adapted for detecting an unconfigured input output device in the aircraft network and for determining at least one application which relates to the unconfigured input output device or which is connected to the unconfigured input output device. The application provision device may be adapted for providing a program software which corresponds to the at least one application for uploading the program on the unconfigured input output device and thereby configuring the substantially unconfigured input out device.

In other words the control device may monitor the input output device and if the control device establishes that an unconfigured input output device is connected to the aircraft network the control device may determine which input output device it is or which type of input output device it is. With information on the type of the input output device the control device may be in a position to provide the respective input output device with the corresponding software or the corresponding program. The control device may then automatically upload the program onto an input output device such that the input output device may be used in the aircraft network substantially without the necessity of any manual intervention.

According to another embodiment a method for controlling an aircraft network may be described which may initially comprise detecting an unconfigured input output device in the aircraft network and determining at least one application which may relate to the unconfigured input output device or which may be associated with the unconfigured input output device. Further the method may allow for providing a program which corresponds to at least one determined or identified application and for uploading or downloading this program onto the unconfigured input output device. In this way the input output device may be configured and integrated into the operation of the network.

The application provision device and the application determination device may be arranged in a common housing of the control device. Alternatively the application provision device and the application determination device may be arranged as separate devices between which devices an exchange of information may take place. In order to detect the association of an application to an input output device and vice versa for example an assignment table or a data base may be used. In this table a correlation between one type of an input output device and an application and vice versa may be stored. However also a certain input output device may be interrelated with exactly one or a number of applications. A certain input output device or an application may be characterised by an individual feature which may allow for an interrelation to be made. Such an individual feature may be a serial number a key a name a reference or a codification. For an application the individual feature may be an application identifier and for an input output device the individual feature may be an input output device identifier.

Furthermore according to another embodiment an input output device for an aircraft network may be presented which comprises a first identification device. The first identification device may be adapted for communicating at least one application running on the input output device or the type thereof to a control device and or a connection switching device. The communicating may be initiated by a trigger on the input output device. Alternatively the application may be communicated after an external query polling which may be directed from the connection switching device or from the control device to the input output device. The communication is made by the input output device to the respective device carrying out the query. The detecting of the application may take place in the input output device.

According to another embodiment a method is described for identifying an input output device. In this method at least one application or at least one type of an application or at least one reference of an application which is running on the input output device may be communicated to a control device or to a connection switching device. In this way the control device of the connection switching device may be able to provide the at least one application which is running or is supposed to run on the input output device. For determining the application for example substantially only the individual identifier of the input output device may be determined and passed to a control device and or the connection switching device. The individual identifier may be provided by the input output device. Alternatively the individual identifier may be provided by a device which may be arranged outside the input output device. In another example the input output device may determine the application associated with said input output device and transmit the respective application identifier to the control device.

According to yet another embodiment a connection switching device may be indicated which comprises a second identification device. The second identification device may be adapted for detecting an input output device which may be connected to the connection switching device and for determining the type of input output device and communicating it to the control device. The second identification device may differ from the first identification device.

According to another embodiment a method may be described which comprises the detection of an input output device in a connection switching device. The input output device may be connected to the connection switching device.

According to yet another embodiment a program element may be indicated which is adapted for carrying out at least one method selected from a group of methods when executed by a processor. The group comprising a method for controlling an aircraft network the method for identifying an input output device and the method for identifying an input output device in the connection switching device.

According to yet another embodiment a computer readable storage medium may be described which comprises a program code which program code may carry out at least one method when executed by a processor which method is selected form the group of methods comprising the method for controlling an aircraft network the method according for identifying an input output device and the method according for identifying an input output device in the connection switching device.

A computer readable storage medium may be a floppy disk a hard disk a hard drive a USB Universal Serial Bus storage medium an RAM Random Access Memory an ROM Read Only Memory or an EPROM Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory . A computer readable storage medium may also denote a data communication network such as for example the Internet which may allow the downloading of a program code.

In order to counteract a system failure in an aircraft network a corresponding redundancy may be available in the aircraft network. A redundancy may be achieved by the availability of several identical components in the aircraft network and by taking over the function of a component that fails by the identical components.

If the at least one application is separated from the hardware platform or from the hardware component on which it runs it may be avoided to retain differently configured devices or systems as redundant systems. Thus it may be avoided to retain a particular hardware configured with an application for each application which may fail. If necessary the configuration of the hardware platform may be carried out depending on the failed applications. Thus a uniform hardware platform with basic equipment may be provided on which applications which are necessary for the operation of the aircraft may run. Such applications may be control systems or regulation systems for the air conditioning or for the landing flaps. These applications may be associated to a logical level of application.

By separating the application level from the hardware level it may no longer be necessary for the same individually configured processing unit or the same CPIOM Core Processing Input Output Module with the same software or application to be present several times in the system. In other words it may no longer be necessary for an individually configured processing unit that is to say a processing unit on which an application has already been installed or uploaded to be kept in reserve. The configuration for the replacement components that is the uploading of the application may not take place substantially until a failure occurs or substantially during installation after which it may substantially be adapted to the present failure or the present installation of components or of CPIOMs. With the same number of unconfigured components that only are configured in the event of a failure a larger number of failure combinations may be achieved as compared to the same number of pre configured components. In the event that all replacement components provided as redundancies are already in use and a further input output device which may comprise a higher criticality fails an application which runs on a replacement component and may comprise a lower criticality may be replaced by an application with a higher level of criticality. A separation of the application level and the hardware level may thus make possible the change of application. Thus the application may be exchanged independently form the hardware platform. A uniform hardware platform may be used for all applications. Before uploading an application substantially uniform hardware components may be provided as redundant components. Substantially only with the uploading of the respective application the hardware components may take over the individual function of a failed component or of a failed input output device. The same may apply for the installation of a component.

The hardware level can provide an interface a programming interface or an API Application Programming Interface which may be accessed by an application. According to an example the hardware level may comprise a firmware a middleware and or an operating system. The hardware level may also be denoted as a hardware layer and the application level may be denoted as an application layer. In this way different applications may be loaded onto a hardware component or onto an input output device which are set on the same basis or on the same hardware level. The applications may be stored as a program code or a program element as a result of which they substantially have only a small space requirement however they may be reproduced at least once or several times even on different input output devices. For example a single redundancy may be provided for different input output devices with just a single hardware component. The same may apply for an n fold or a multiple redundancy.

If the system or the device have an individual configuration the device the input output device or the CPIOM would need to be removed after a failure and replaced by a new device of the same type that is to say with the same software or application. Because of the multiple existence of part numbers needed to indicate the individual configured equipment or CPIOMs a storage load may increase.

When the application that is to be configured on an input output device is detected and the corresponding program is provided through the aircraft network directly from the control device the loading of the corresponding software via an external data source such as for example a CD ROM may be avoided. Uploading of the applications onto the components may take place in a contact free manner directly with respect to the component. In particular the manual loading by a technician to load the software or the program may be avoided.

Thus according to an embodiment there may be an unconfigured replacement device connected to the network particularly to the aircraft network which device may be configured in such a way that it may assume the functions or the applications of any other device after this other device may have failed. The function may be uploaded from the control device or from the control center onto the replacement device which is to say onto the redundant input output device or onto the unconfigured CPIOM. After the uploading of the respective application or of the at least one application the replacement device may take over the function of a failed device.

Thus the control device may therefore identify the failed configured processing unit or the configured CPIOM and load software that corresponds to this identified configured CPIOM from an internal memory in the control device. As in one example the CPIOMs may be designed substantially purely digital the necessity of providing different part numbers for the software and or the hardware may be avoided. With the use of non purely digital CPIOMs for example 7 different part numbers may be different not only for the software but also be different for the hardware as for example different sensors etc. may be connected to the CPIOMs or to the hardware thus making combinations of hardware and software distinguishable by part numbers.

During the flight the control device may be able to automatically i.e. substantially without the intervention of a technician replace a failed system for substantially restoring the full functionality of the aircraft. The automatic configuration may be employed not only for error treatment. During the installation an unconfigured device may also be detected and provided with an application allocated to the device so that it may be integrated quickly into the network. The uploading of a function of a failed device onto an initially unconfigured device may take place during the flight.

Depending on their importance or criticality the applications or programs may run redundantly and in parallel on several configured input output devices. This may imply for example that a critical application as for example the landing system or a control system for the landing flaps may run on three independent separate input output devices for providing a threefold redundancy. With such a threefold redundancy it may be possible for two devices or applications to fail and the function relating to the application for example the landing flap function yet to be substantially provided. However the redundancy may be reduced as it may be present one time instead of being threefold.

If an application fails or a device onto which a specific application may be installed the control device may provide the redundantly available unconfigured system with a copy of the at least one application of the failed device or CPIOM. In this way despite the failure of a device the maximum necessary amount of redundancy may be provided for as for example in the above example the availability of three redundant applications is provided for. If this maximum predetermined amount of redundancy is present a failed device or a failed input output device may not need to be replaced immediately after a flight. Consequently the standing time between two flights may not additionally be increased and the maintenance expenditure may thus be reduced.

In other words in the event of a failure of only one processing unit the available unconfigured reserve unit or the unconfigured input output device may take over the function of the failed processing unit and maintain the predetermined redundancy. The control device may be adapted for maintaining the predetermined redundancy by uploading of corresponding applications onto unconfigured components as long as a sufficiently high number of components are available. In one example not only a single unconfigured input output device component or a single reserve system may be available but any number of reserve units may be available. For example the same number of available devices may also be available as a reserve unit. With the use of the control device according to the present invention the flight operation may be flexible i.e. the failure of an input output device substantially may not lead to any limitations in the further flight operation.

Redundancy can be increased virtually. Redundancy may actually be increased by the parallel presence of a maximum predetermined number of redundant devices or applications. The provision of an unconfigured input output device may increase the redundancy virtually as in the event of the failure of a system of the actual redundancy this too may be replaced. The safety of an aircraft equipped with a control device may be increased. Redundancy may also be increased to a level in excess of that stipulated by the flight authorities.

Further the number of available devices may be reduced in order to arrive at the same redundancy as without the use of the control device which may result in reducing weight and cost as fewer devices may be used. If a system that is available for ensuring the actual redundancy fails the redundancy of the entire system would be either lost or reduced which may lead to a downgrading of the aircraft systems. A downgrading would occur for example if after the failure of an application only a twofold redundancy instead of a threefold redundancy was available.

According to a further exemplary embodiment the control device may comprise an error detection device. The error detection device may be adapted for detecting an error in a configured input output device. A configured input output device may be understood to be an input output device that comprises at least one predeterminable application.

The application determination device may be adapted in such a way that when an unconfigured input output device is detected it determines the applications which are provided for this input output device. The application determination device may be adapted for determining the at least one predeterminable application on a configured input output device in the event of an error in such a way that at least one application is an application affected by the error in the configured input output device. In other words the application determination device may identify in the control device the type of the at least one application to be replaced.

An error detection device enables a detection of the unconfigured system and its commissioning as well as error elimination. The error detection device may identify the available or predetermined applications on the configured input output device and pass this information to the application determination device so that the necessary applications may be provided.

According to another embodiment the control device further comprises a connection determination device. The connection determination device may be adapted for re routing a connection leading to the configured input output device to the originally unconfigured input output device. For example a connection may connect an application to a peripheral device and or to another application. A connection may be a virtual connection.

A re routing i.e. a re arrangement of connections may be carried out within the network. In this way sensors or actuators or general peripheral devices may be connected to the respectively allocated or associated application. As in the event of an error a migration of at least one application from a configured system to an unconfigured device may take place it may also be necessary to re route the connections leading to the initially configured input output device to the initially unconfigured and now newly configured input output device. In the case of a migration an application may be carried out on a different hardware component and or at a different place than prior to the migration. A migration may be linked to the uploading of an application onto a hardware component. With the help of the connection determination device the peripheral devices may again be connected to the respective applications.

According to yet exemplary embodiment the re routing of a connection may be carried out depending on a priority of an application related to the connections. The priority may be determined by at least one of the criteria selected from the group of criteria comprising the criticality of an application the signal propagation time the signal delay time or latency and the number of processing stages. When re routing connections it may happen that a connection relating to a critical application is routed via heavily loaded or slow nodes. For this reason taking into account of the load or the latency time of a node or of the number of intermediary nodes situated between the periphery and the input output device may allow for providing for a reaction time or quality of service.

According to yet another embodiment the connection determination device may be adapted for communicating with a connection switching device for re routing the connection. For the communication between the connection switching device and the control device a communication channel may be established between the connection switching device and the control device through which channel information for example relating to the signal propagation time or the loading of a node may be exchanged.

According to yet another embodiment the control device may be adapted for operating at an aircraft specific infrastructure such as for example an aircraft specific power supply. Furthermore the device may also be configured for operating an aircraft specific network such as for example an ARINC 429 or an ARINC 629 or an AFDX Avionic Full Duplex Network . In particular a digital and or an analogue connection of peripheral components such as sensors may be distinguished. The control device may be prepared for the connection of aircraft specific sensors. Therein the peripheral components may be connected in all possible ways to the control device or to the aircraft network. Therefore all types of data may be supported. The nature of the data transmission for example from the sensors may be analogue digital ARINC 429 ARINC 629 etc. or in any other form. The communication of the CPIOMs with the switches the IOMs the SSNMS and the other network components may take place via AFDX according to an embodiment. In other words for example peripheral devices such as sensors may be connected to the network digitally and or in analogue form the internal network communications may take place via AFDX. A power supply for an aircraft may be a 28V direct current supply.

An Integrated Modular Avionics IMA or a next generation IMA may be implemented. IMA may be another name for an aircraft network. The input output device or CPIOM may comprise a pin programming or a pin coding as an identification device or in an identification device. The pin coding that is to say an individual arrangement of pins allows for the type of an input output device or for input output device and thus for the related application or an application identifier to be identified. The pin coding or the pin programming that is to say programming through a pin code enables the control device to determine the applications that relate to the unconfigured input output device. Pin programming may determine an address for an input output device. A pin coding may constitute an individual labelling for an input output device.

According to a further embodiment the second identification device or the further identification device may comprise a port through which the connected input output device may be identified. Through this port for example the individual labelling for the input output device that is connected to the port may be determined.

According to yet another embodiment the connection switching device may comprise a memory device. The memory device comprises a dynamic memory range for the storage of virtual connections. By separating a dynamic memory range from a fixed memory range a dynamic routing of virtual connections or of virtual links may be carried out.

It should be noted that different are described in relation to different subjects. In particular certain embodiments were described in relation to device type claims while other aspects were described in relation to method type claims. However from the previous description and from the description that follows unless it is described differently a person skilled in the art would understand that in addition to any combination of features relating to one category of subjects also any other combination of features relating to different categories of subjects is disclosed by this text. In particular combinations of features concerning a device type claim and features concerning a method type claim are disclosed.

This and other embodiments may be described further in relation to the embodiments described below. Below embodiments are presented with reference to the drawings.

The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit application and uses. Furthermore there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or summary or the following detailed description.

By way of the internal link the application provision device may access the data base in which both the allocation of a CPIOM to corresponding applications and the program code of the respective application are stored. That is to say the data base also provides a program library which may be read out by the application determination device via the internal link and may be made available via the internal bus and the external interface to the associated CPIOM.

For identification purposes the CPIOM may have a distinct address or a distinct identifier by way of which the control device or the SSNMS may identify the CPIOM and may determine an application associated to it. The application provision device may thus provide a program from the data base which corresponds to at least one application which was identified as being associated to the CPIOM. The application provision device may actively upload the corresponding programs actively onto the identified CPIOMs by way of program uploading mechanisms as for example FTP File Transfer Protocol . Communication between the application determination device and the application provision device is shown by the double arrow .

The control device may further comprise the error detection device which is also connected to the internal bus . The control device may also be constructed to be redundant and may for example be present at least in duplicate. Due to the redundant layout of the control device the failure of one of the at least two control devices may be tolerated.

With the help of the error detection device does not only an unconfigured input output device and its associated software may be determined. It is also possible to determine a malfunctioning or a defective configured input output device and identify one or more applications relating to the configured input output device and upload these as a copy onto a redundant unconfigured input output device. In other words with the error detection device an error may be detected and the application provision device may be controlled in such a way that the application provision device does not just produce a new configuration of an unconfigured input output device but also produces a copy of a failed configured input output device. The applications can be uploaded onto the input output device in the form of an image.

Two operating modes may be distinguished inside the control device which modes may be switchable by a switch not shown . The first operating mode may provide an intelligent plug and play mechanism in other words it may provide an intelligent configuration service. With this plug and play mechanism an intelligent IMA system may be realised. The plug and play operating mode or the configuration operation mode may be of interest for maintenance work or also in the case of system failures.

The plug and play mechanism or the automatic CPIOM detection and the automatic software installation may be activated when a new CPIOM is installed in a network and the system is re started. By way of appropriate trigger mechanisms an unconfigured CPIOM or an unconfigured input output device may signalize to the control device that it is there and that it may be automatically configured by software.

In a second operating mode the system may automatically repair and re configure itself with the repair and re configuration being quickly effected. The repair and configuration may be carried out by an operator or by the system itself in other words it is carried out substantially autarkic.

As an unconfigured input output device is employed which is only configured as the need arises it may not be necessary for a number of different part numbers to exist for an input output device or for a CPIOM. Storage of replacement parts may be reduced by the omitting of several different part numbers for pre configured CPIOMs and the risk of faulty parts being present in storage may be reduced.

A connection to the aircraft network may be established by the interface or identification device so that the input output device and the control device may establish contact via the aircraft network. The identification device may be adapted in such a way that with a restart or a reset of the input output device a trigger a request notification or a request signal may be sent to a respective control device so that the system of the SSNMS may detect a newly installed input output device or a newly installed CPIOM and automatically upload software in particular an appropriate software onto the input output device .

The identification device may also be connected to a connection switching device shown in or to an AFDX switch . For the connection the AFDX switch or connection switching device may provide ports . The ports may serve as an interface for the connection switching device . By way of a port the connection switching device together with a second identification device may determine the type of the input output device not shown in . The second identification device may be adapted for determining the type of an input output device which is connected to the connection switching device . By way of the switching network the connection switching device may interconnect for example via virtual connections a plurality of input output devices which are connected to the ports . Similarly the switch or the connection switching device may establish a connection to a connected SSNMS equally not shown in . For establishing the connection with the SSNMS either the existing network may be used or a separate data configuration line may be provided between SSNMS and connection switching device . The gates or interfaces may all correspond to the same standard according to an embodiment. An example for a standard of interfaces may be AFDX.

The intelligent plug and play IMA system or aircraft network which may be built up by the control device the input output device and the connection switching device may allow for an intelligent error treatment while the aircraft is in operation. For example in the event of the failure of a complete CPIOM or a complete input output device the aircraft network which if formed by at least one connection switching device may make use of a CPIOM which although unconfigured is already installed in the network.

The flow of the error recognition and error correction in the aircraft network is shown in and . shows the SSNMS which is connected to an AFDX network or the aircraft network . The aircraft network comprises the physical AFDX links which connect the AFDX switches to other components. The AFDX network is a digital network. The aircraft network forms an aircraft control system.

The AFDX switches are connected to the central SSNMS the input output devices the micro switch the cRDCs Common Remote Data Concentrator and the IOMs input output modules . The CPIOMs contain the same basic software core software or firmware . The first three CPIOMs shown in are already configured input output devices each of which contains four applications.

The applications are numbered in sequence using a numerical code. The numerical code may be regarded an application identifier. For example CPIOM comprises the applications . . . to . where n may represent any natural number that corresponds to the number of applications installed on a CPIOM or to the plurality of installed applications. The second CPIOM CPIOM correspondingly comprises the four applications . . . and . the third CPIOM CPIOM correspondingly comprises the four applications . . . and .

The applications of the configured CPIOMs may be redundant applications. In this way for example the applications . . and . may correspond to each other and in the event of a failure they may replace each other. The use of redundant applications makes possible that if for example the third CPIOM module fails module . . is still available several times. An application may for example be the control of a landing flap. The fourth CPIOM CPIOM is substantially an unconfigured CPIOM a replacement CPIOM or a spare CPIOM . That means that apart from the basic software the reserve CPIOM or the spare CPIOM comprises no application.

The intelligent sensors or the smart sensors are also connected to the micro switch via digital links for example AFDX links . By way of analogue lines ARINC Aeronautical Radio Incorporated lines or CAN Controller Area Network lines sensors or sensors or actuators are connected at the cRDCs to the IOMs . The peripheral devices may be connected to the AFDX or aircraft network via the micro switch the cRDCs and the IOMs 

The aircraft network in particular the SSNMS detects the second CPIOM which is affected by the failure and also detects the software applications . . . and .originally installed on the CPIOM . As indicated by the arrow the SSNMS firstly tries to load the identified applications . . . and .of the second CPIOM onto the still unconfigured CPIOM . The flexible loading of the applications may increase the reliability of the aircraft network which comprises the system components and the AFDX links .

Once the applications have been loaded onto the replacement CPIOM the SSNMS determines the new connections for the virtual links and . The SSNMS is connected to the AFDX switches by the control channels and exchanges routing information i.e. information on the progress of the new virtual connections . A control channel may be designed as a separate line. A control channel may also be understood as being a communication via an AFDX line or a communication in an AFDX network.

In this way the new or re routed virtual connections and shown in may result which connections now connect the third CPIOM to the fourth CPIOM the second IOM to the fourth CPIOM and the smart sensor to the fourth CPIOM . The newly configured fourth CPIOM now comprises the applications . . . and .of the originally second CPIOM . In this way a re configuration has taken place which this has substantially not affected the peripheral devices. An assignment of corresponding sensors or of peripheral devices to the applications . . . and .may still be established.

In other words the plug and play IMA architecture may comprise IMA components and the SSNMS . The plug and play IMA aircraft network system comprises the cRDC the CPIOMs and at least one replacement CPIOM . Furthermore the aircraft network comprises the IOMs the AFDX switches the micro switch and the SSNMS . The use of a substantially unconfigured CPIOM may allow avoiding that different CPIOMs or input output boards which are arranged at certain positions and carry out fixed functions of the CPIOM have to be used. In this way the number of part numbers for a CPIOM may be reduced. The plug and play CPIOMs which may be configured and loaded by an SSNMS may be realised as digital CPIOMs. Therein only a single part number P N may exist.

As the CPIOMs are substantially completely realised as digital plug and play CPIOMs the IOMs and the RDCs are provided which substantially collect the analogue data from the sensors and transmit this data digitally to the ADCN Aircraft Data Communication Network or aircraft network . The IMA system ADCN or aircraft network without plug and play functionality and without error correction functionality may function as a conventional IMA system and for being compatible with a conventional IMA system.

However if a system error arises on a CPIOM and is detected by the SSNMS the SSNMS loads the affected and lost system software . . . .onto the replacement CPIOM via the ADCN or aircraft network . In parallel with the transfer of the software or the programs by the SSNMS to the unconfigured CPIOM the switches are updated or configured with information on the newly to be established virtual links or virtual connections . Updating the switches may be carried out in a specific dynamic software area of the switches or in a special dynamic software area of the connection switching devices which is separate from the static path information or the static routing information.

The dynamic routes of the virtual links may be carried out taking into account certain priority requirements. The newly to be established virtual links should be configured in such a way that overload situations are avoided on the individual switches . The traffic load on the switches is established at the design stage. In particular an upper limit for the maximum acceptable traffic load for each switch is fixed. In the event of a new configuration or a re configuration because of a system error or a failure of a CPIOM the network and in particular the SSNMS knows value of the free switching capacity of the connection switching device in each of the connection switching devices. This traffic load may be taken into account by the SSNMS when re routing or re locating the virtual links so that Mission Critical Application may still be carried out in real time.

In addition to the load also the delay time or the latency time of the virtual links may be in accordance with the requirements of the system concerned. For example data relating to flight critical applications such as the operation of landing flaps have to use the shortest possible route through the aircraft network in order to enable the data particularly the speed of exchanging data within the required response time to be ensured. In other words the SSNMS may be adapted in such a way that particular criticality requirements of aircraft systems such as for example landing flaps tail unit or chassis may be taken into account.

Data relating to an application classified as non critical may take a longer path through the aircraft network or accept a longer delay time through a greater number of switches than data relating to flight critical applications. Longer virtual connections or a greater number of switches to be passed or longer delay times may lead to longer response times. The SSNMS may administer a priority list in which the maximum acceptable response times for the applications . . . .are listed. After the re configuration the aircraft network functions substantially in the same way as before the failure of the CPIOM . The failure of a single system may substantially imply no limitations of the flight operation.

The SSNMS may also determine the procedure to be followed for the repair of a defective CPIOM . It may use the newly configured CPIOM as a standard CPIOM and then return the repaired CPIOM or exchanged CPIOM into the system as a replacement CPIOM. The configuration of a newly installed CPIOM functions substantially in the same way as error correction wherein the error detection may be omitted. The control device the input output device and the connection switching device may be designed as plug in cards for a rack system for use in an aircraft.

The criticality may denote how important or how indispensable a certain system may be for the operation of an aircraft. A system whose failure may lead to serious consequences may comprise a higher criticality than a system whose failure may lead to less serious consequences. Thus for example the failure of an on board entertainments system is less critical than the failure of a navigation device. The criticality may provide a priority which may be taken into account when uploading replacement applications in the event of a failure of a CPIOM . Criticality or priority may be provided by a flight safety authority.

The method may then provide for the determination of at least one application that is to be installed on the unconfigured system . In the event of a new installation a reference may be established by addressing from an input output device to an associated application. In the event of a re configuration when a failure occurs the application may be determined by a failed application and or its criticality.

In step S a program relating to the identified application is provided which program corresponds to the identified application and which may be uploaded in step S onto the input output device. In step S the system is again in an idle mode.
