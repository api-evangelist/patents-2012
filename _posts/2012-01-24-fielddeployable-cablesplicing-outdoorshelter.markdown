title: Field-deployable cable-splicing outdoor-shelter
abstract: Apparatus and methodology providing, a portable enclosed space in an outdoors setting, the space being free from environmentally-induced distractions. A technician can perform a mechanical or fusion splice on an optical fiber inside the space. Splicing or fusing miniscule optical fibers is challenging out of doors, particularly when distracted b wind, rain, snow, sun-glare, bugs, animals, etc. A tent is supported by a “spine” support structure modularly constructed by the technician in the outdoors location where an optical fiber operation shall take place. A splice-tray is affixed to the spine, the tray height being adjustable to accommodate that technician and provide an approximately horizontal work surface. The tent can be used on soft ground, hard pavement, leaning against utility poles or further supported by attachment to overhead cables. The technician can perform delicate operations on optical cables inside the tent with outside distractions mitigated.

Fiber optic cable is now being widely deployed by telecommunication companies because it has advantages over copper wire cable such as having much greater bandwidth. Each optical glass fiber in a multi fiber fiber optic cable has a glass core encapsulated by glass cladding the clad core having an outside diameter on the order of 125 microns m . One micron is only one thousandth of a millimeter or only about 0.000039 inches.

From time to time these tiny glass fibers may need to be spliced together in the field during installation or when making modifications after installation. One splicing technique called fusion splicing is analogous to welding two pieces of metal together and involves an electrical arc that melts the glass at the ends of the two fused together fibers. A fusion splice can take a relatively long time to accomplish perhaps as much as 45 minutes per splice. By comparison a mechanical splice of an optical fiber requires far less time because it uses only physical contact between two end faces surfaces of two different optical glass fibers without melting the glass. But because of the inherently small dimensions involved quality mechanical splicing can be hard to accomplish even under ideal working conditions.

Regardless of whether fusion mechanical or some other splice technique is employed attempting to splice together optical fibers in the field is very challenging and if the field splicing operation must be performed in the out of doors rather than in an enclosed building then multiple environmental distractions may add to the challenge. For example if one is trying to accomplish the delicate operation of fusing together or mechanically splicing two optical fibers having diameters of only 125 microns then any gust of wind any precipitation rain snow hail sleet etc. any insect bite suffered by the user any animal nuisance any excessive heat or sunlight glare and or any other environmentally caused perturbation can reduce the likelihood of a successful fusing splicing operation.

What is needed therefore is an advantageous technique for separating the user technician from the outdoors environment while simultaneously providing him her with a virtually motionless but otherwise portable work surface for facilitating the fusing splicing operation. The instant disclosure and claimed subject matter address this need.

In this description the same reference numeral in different Figs. refers to the same entity. Otherwise reference numerals of each Fig. start with the same number as the number of that Fig. For example has numerals in the category and has numerals in the category etc.

In overview various embodiments include apparatus and or methodology for protecting and separating a user technician from outdoor distractions when he she is performing a delicate optical fiber fusion or splicing operation in the out of doors.

In a particular embodiment the apparatus includes a portable support structure or spine which is configured to be held in an upright and immobile position. A work surface is configured to be supported in an immobile and approximately horizontal position by from the spine. The work surface can be formed as a tray with an upright lip around the tray periphery to prevent loose items which are resting upon the surface of the tray to roll or slide off the tray. The tray has user operable clamps for clamping the tray upon the trunks of the spine at a location or height selected by the user. A tent supported by the spine and enveloping the spine and the work surface is configured to separate a user technician working at the work surface inside the tent from environmental distractions occurring outside of the tent. The work surface is used for splicing or fusing optical fiber communication cable. If the spine is constructed from metal such as aluminum there is provided a safety grounding path conductively connecting the spine to earth ground.

More particularly the spine comprises two linear and mutually parallel trunks interconnected by a plurality of horizontal spacers each of the trunks having either a pointed earth piercing shaft affixed at the bottom of the trunk for piercing the earth and implanting the spine firmly into the earth or each of the trunks fitting into a weighted boot receptacle for holding the spine upright and immobile when the apparatus is located on a hard surface. The trunks comprise a plurality of trunk modules each module having one spacer interconnecting two or a pair of trunk segments one segment forming a portion of one trunk and the other segment forming a portion of the other trunk. The trunk modules are modularly matingly inter connected one to another in a manner to configure the spine. The trunk segments are each of sufficient length such that the plurality of trunk modules provides a total spine length height to accommodate the height of the user when standing upright inside the tent. The spine height is thereby adjustable as a function of the number of modules and the length of each module s pair of trunk segments where each pair can be the same length as another pair or where each trunk segment pair can be different in length from some or all of the other segment pairs.

In yet another feature the top most trunk module or only the top most trunk module includes a horizontally oriented curvilinear rib configured to provide a form to allow the tent material draped over the rib to define a periphery of the tent that allows adequate space for the user standing upright inside the tent. If the spine is to be supported by a generally horizontal cable running between two vertical utility poles two encircling hooks are modularly connected to the top most trunk module where the hooks are configured to encircle the horizontal cable. The tent accommodates these hooks by having zipper flaps that open to allow the hooks to penetrate therethrough. To mitigate effects of rainwater entering into the tent via the opened zipper flaps a protective tarp similar in function to an umbrella is wrapped over the horizontal cable and snap connected to the upper portion of the tent thereby forming a water runoff surface covering the openings in the tent through which the hooks have penetrated.

Each trunk segment can be a hollow cylinder or a hollow structure in accordance with another external configuration to enable it to nest or snug fit into an interfacing trunk segment as shown forming solid spine . Or each trunk segment can be a solid cylinder or a solid structure in accordance with another external configuration but with an aperture at one of its otherwise solid ends to enable it to nest or snug fit into an interfacing trunk segment as shown forming solid spine . In other words the cross section of the interfacing aperture in either the hollow or solid segment embodiments could be circular triangular square rectangular hexagonal octagonal etc. Similarly the external cross section in either the hollow or solid segment embodiments can be circular triangular square rectangular hexagonal octagonal etc. and need not match its aperture cross section. In addition to the snug fit there can be conventional spring loaded buttons and apertures not shown associated with the trunk segments so that a spring loaded button on one segment will snap into such aperture on its adjacent mating segment when the segments are nested together the buttons are pressed down to release them from the nesting condition.

Trunk modules can be made from metal e.g. aluminum or from hard plastic and other modules not shown can be added if more height is needed to form a spine that meets a height requirement for a particular user. Each of the modules can have trunk segments that are the same length from module to module or they can have different lengths to enable a user to construct a total length spine of a particular height suitable to that particular user. Except for trunk module the trunk modules are functionally identical. Module being the top most module in the group has additional functionality. The tops of trunk segments of uppermost module further support a horizontally oriented curvilinear rib shown in in a front view this is further discussed in connection with .

The combined length of trunk segments and form a trunk hereinafter trunk B and the combined length of trunk segments and form another trunk hereinafter trunk C the same length as trunk B. Trunks B and C are mutually parallel because the spacers and are all the same length. The bottom of trunk segment can be nested into earth piercing shank and the bottom of trunk segment can be nested into earth piercing shank c. The shanks are inserted by a technician user into earth soil to hold spine upright. Ground wire made from copper or other conductive material is conductively connected between a trunk of spine when spine is constructed from conductive metal such as aluminum and grounding shank used for piercing earth soil to ensure harmless conduction of extraneous electricity to ground this is particularly important when utilizing boot which is not implanted into the ground discussed in connection with . Alternatively instead of using grounding shank to pierce the soil a large conductive metal clip not shown can be substituted for shank such clip configured to clamp onto a metal grounding rod not shown that was inserted into the ground such clip and rod ensuring a safe grounding path from the metal ladder.

Cable hook is shown at the top of . Cable hook shaft can be snug fit into an aperture not shown in trunk segment and can be further secured by a spring loaded button and aperture scheme discussed above . There is another cable hook not shown in this Fig. because it is hidden from view by cable hook which can be snug fit into an aperture not shown in trunk segment . These cable hooks after secure insertion into their respective trunk segments can be used to secure spine to an overhead power line or communication line running between two vertical utility poles not shown while still being supported on the ground by e.g. boots . The length of the spine would need to be elongated dramatically to accommodate the additional height of the horizontal cable not shown running above the ground by some 25 feet or more. This additional height can be accomplished quickly with larger trunk modules. The elongated spine is not used as a ladder and another device such as a ladder or a bucket truck is needed to work with this particular spine support. In an alternative embodiment belts or straps not shown can be added and securely connected to trunk segments of uppermost module and or elsewhere on trunks B and C to provide added security and stability. These belts straps can be tightened around the overhead horizontal cable and buckled locked to provide security in addition to hooks tightened around a ladder not shown and buckled locked if such ladder is being used in connection with spine tightened around a vertical utility pole not shown and buckled locked if spine is placed against such pole and tightened around suitable protuberances not shown projecting from a wall not shown if spine is positioned near against that wall.

Referring to together is an exemplary schematic diagram of a side view of a work surface tray mechanism and is a top view of the mechanism of . Tray is shown in in a side view with dashed line being a hidden line representing the edge of the work surface of the tray. In tray surface represents the surface corresponding to edge of surface . The distance between the top of side wall in and dashed line represents the height of the lip or flange that rises above and encompasses the periphery of work surface . The lip is configured to prevent small items used by the technician operator in the splicing fusing operation to roll or slide off the work surface.

Tray is pivotably connected by a pin to clamp which can be slidably positioned over and clamped to trunk C. Tray is also pivotably connected similarly to clamp shown in but hidden from view in which can be slidably positioned over and clamped to trunk B. Tray is further pivotably connected to brace or truss support which in turn is pivotably connected to clamp which in turn can be slidably positioned over and clamped to trunk C. Tray is yet further pivotably connected to brace or truss support shown in but hidden from view in which in turn is pivotably connected to a companion clamp hidden from view in both and which in turn can be slidably positioned over and clamped to trunk B. similar to how clamp clamps to trunk A.

The work surface is approximately horizontal and its precise horizontal orientation is a function of where the various clamps are clamped on trunks B and C and whether or not the spine is implanted or booted in a vertical orientation. Even if the spine is constrained to not be vertical because e.g. its boots rest upon a hard pavement that is inclined where the boots orient the spine in other than a vertical direction the tray can still be adjusted towards the horizontal because clamp and its companion clamp can be separately adjusted up or downwhile clamps remain in a fixed position on the trunks. And even if tray surface does not achieve perfect horizontal orientation that does not diminish the functionality of the tray as serving as an appropriate work surface for fusion splicing operations because perfect horizontal orientation is not essential and the peripheral lip on the tray holds all loose items on the surface. However the tray should be held virtually motionless.

However even with both zippers zipped closed the enclosed tent space is not completely sealed at least because of formed apertures and in mat . These apertures are precisely separated in the mat to receive earth piercing shafts there through at the appropriate separation to accommodate trunks B and C respectively when positioning the spine on ground soil.

Therefore the mat can be laid down on the soft earth first then pointy shafts either empty or holding trunks B and C can be inserted through the holes into the earth and then the spine can be inserted into the positioned shafts and held in a vertical orientation. Then tray is clamped to trunks B and C at an appropriate height for the technician and adjusted to be horizontal after which tent is draped over the immobile spine and tray. Finally the technician can enter the tent space via open zipper or can enter via the open bottom of the tent can then zipper close mat to the bottom of the tent and can then zipper close vertical zipper . However if boots are used instead of shanks because the operation is taking place on a paved surface the sequence of fabrication of the tent shelter can be the same but the boots shall cover holes instead of penetrating them. Other sequences of assembly can also be followed as discussed with respect to FIGS. A B.

When spine is attached to a horizontal wire or cable running between two vertical utility poles not shown by using security hook connected to trunk B and its companion hook not shown connected to trunk C spine must have previously been elongated by adding other modules to modules and so that spine can reach from the ground to the elevated cable. Its bottom most module can be inserted into boot s or into shanks depending on which is used based on ground details. The tray under the tent connected to the spine steadied by the horizontal wire is accessible by a technician via a separate ladder propped up against that horizontal cable. Such a ladder is shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 492 325 filed Jun. 26 2009 entitled FALL ARREST LADDERS SYSTEM assigned to the assignee of the present application and hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The tray in this scenario is also accessible by a technician via an elevated bucket in a bucket truck. The tent used in this elevated bucket truck instance may be a fuller or larger version of that used in the previous on the ground scenario to enable the tent material to also drape over the elevated bucket in which the user is standing. Either this procedure or the ladder procedure is used for accessing splicing tray which is substantially above ground in this overhead wire scenario.

If no the algorithm moves to step where the technician places floor mat upon a selected location on the soil convenient to the optical cable joint to be spliced and inserts earth piercing shanks through apertures into the soil either before or after he she inserts trunks B and C into the shanks. This provides an upright spine planted in the soil. But if yes the algorithm instead moves to step where the technician places floor mat upon a selected location on the pavement convenient to the optical cable joint to be spliced and then places weighted boots one boot hiding the other from view in over apertures in the floor mat and trunks B and C are inserted into the weighted boots. This also provides an upright spine but on hard pavement instead of soft soil.

Regardless of which upright spine approach is taken a query is made in step is the spine electrically conductive If yes then in step electrically conductive ground cable is connected between spine and earth by way of shank . In the event that the hard surface scenario is extant ground cable is long enough to permit it to be planted in adjoining soil. Then in step a tray is connected to the spine and it is adjusted in height and angular orientation to make it as horizontal as possible.

In step a query is made is the spine additionally supported by an overhead cable telephone cable fiber optic cable other utility cable some 20 30 feet above ground running between two vertical utility poles If not then the algorithmic process moves to step where the technician drapes the tent over the spine and the attached tray and zips closed the floor mat to the bottom of the tent. Then in step the user technician enters the tent places the splicer on the tray along with cables to be spliced zips closed the side opening through which he entered the tent and performs the splice fusion operation. The process if not involved with an overhead line support is then completed. But in step if the spine were additionally supported by an overhead line the process would have moved instead to A in .

Next in query step it is determined if rain or other precipitation is impacting the tent. If not in step while holding the splice mechanism and the cable to be spliced the technician enters the tent which is now off the ground being suspended from the spine hooked over the overhead cable by way of a ladder or a bucket from a bucket truck and performs the splice or fusion operation. If a ladder is used it also may be stabilized by hooks over the horizontal cable e.g. the ladder disclosed in the incorporated by reference patent application .

But if there is rainy weather after the user inserts hooks through the tent flaps and connects the hooks around the overhead cable and drapes the tent over the spine and attached tray per step the user then wraps protective tarp in step over the overhead cable and connects it via snaps to the tent. This forms a water runoff shield like an umbrella to keep the rainwater out of apertures in the tent associated with open flaps and . Thereafter step is performed as described above and the process terminates.

In this specification various preferred embodiments have been described with reference to the accompanying drawings. It will however be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto and additional embodiments may be implemented without departing from the broader scope of the invention as set forth in the claims that follow. For example the spine could be leaned against a vertical utility pole in addition to the other supports disclosed. The present invention is thus not to be interpreted as being limited to particular embodiments and the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense
