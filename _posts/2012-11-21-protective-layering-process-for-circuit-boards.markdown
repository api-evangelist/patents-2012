title: Protective layering process for circuit boards
abstract: A polymer layering process that encapsulates and protects electronics components with complex and imprecise geometries. The protective layering process provides a combination of a flexible mold and/or a rigid mold that apply close-forming, encapsulating the polymer layers to the electronic components and precision assemblies. Polymer layer protective jackets are shaped to as-populated circuit boards and assemblies, providing tightly fit barriers with fine resolution accommodating imprecise geometries. The protective jackets can be formed in rigid, semi-rigid, or highly flexible polymer films, to protect the circuitry from the elements, CTE mismatches, shock and vibration loads and extreme g-forces.

This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 61 563 939 filed on Nov. 28 2011 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates in general to the field of circuit board manufacturing. More specifically this invention relates to an improved protective thin film layering process that protects electronic components with complex and imprecise geometries. The protective layering process provides a combination of a flexible mold and a rigid mold or another means to produce the same that apply close forming encapsulating polymer or other layers to the electronic components.

Conformal coatings are widely used in both the military and industrial electronics applications for protecting circuit board assemblies from moisture dust chemicals and temperature extremes to prevent damage or failure of the electronic components. While the use of conformal coatings offers several advantages compared to uncoated circuit board assemblies their application constitutes a wet process which requires the use of hazardous chemicals that must be applied by spraying brushing or dipping followed by drying and or curing processes.

In addition it would be difficult to control the conformal coating thickness as well as the formation of pin holes. With the exception of parylene which must be applied by expensive vacuum deposition equipment and which does not lend itself to high volume production most organic conformal coatings are readily penetrated by water molecules.

For a conformal coating to be effective ionizable contaminants such as salts must be prevented from reaching the circuit nodes where they can combine with water to form microscopically thin electrolyte layers that can be both corrosive and electrically conductive. Also for the conformal coatings to adhere properly to the circuit board assemblies thereby minimizing peeling de wetting and the propensity to form pin holes all surface contamination must be removed prior to the application of the conformal coating using another wet process such as a vapor degreasing or semi aqueous washing in a special equipment. Special shielding and masking measures must also be taken while applying the conformal coatings to prevent it from contaminating connectors sensitive components and the circuit board assemblies.

The application of a close fitting thin layer of polymer or another material in flat sheet form over the circuit board assembly and its electronic components either by a vacuum or pressure molding or by other suitable processes would offer superior protection from moisture dust chemicals and temperature extremes compared to conformal coatings. A thin polymer layer or multiple thin layers could be selected to provide various additional attributes such as improved heat dissipation ESD and EMI protection and control and protection from handling and in use shocks.

Thin polymer layers could be added to the circuit board assemblies for use in non potted as well as potted applications. In potted applications the polymer layers would offer additional benefits such as forming a barrier to prevent the potting material from seeping into areas around and underneath sensitive components. After being cured potting materials could cause high stresses such as a residual stress and a thermal expansion stress during temperature cycling due to the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches and also due to contraction and expansion of the potting material itself.

More specifically potting materials are being used with increasing frequency in both commercial and military applications to encapsulate the electronic components and circuit board assemblies of electronic systems. The use of potting materials allows for a simpler support structure while also enabling a smaller over all system design as well as enhanced structural support for the electronic components and circuit board assemblies against shock and vibration.

A major disadvantage with encapsulants or potting materials however is the fact that they are permanent solid bodies that prevent any access or servicing of the components they encapsulate. Potting materials are almost always thermoset materials that harden once and cannot not be re softened or reused

In numerous military munition designs where the electronic components must survive the extremely high g forces experienced during gun launch the potted electronics are inactive until the munition is used. Until this time the munition may have been in storage without environmental temperature and humidity controls for up to 20 years.

In contrast the electronics for most commercial applications tend to be active for most of their lifetime where the operating environment is more stable and predictable. Without external temperature controls or the fairly constant temperature environment that active electronics create for themselves inactive electronic components experience continuously varying physical stresses which are created due to their intimate contact with the potting material and the different rates of expansion and contraction that each produces with changes in temperature. If the changes in temperature are severe enough or repeated a sufficient number of times the physical stresses induced on the inactive electronic components can be severe. The resultant loads or stresses can be high enough to fracture the ceramic lids of hollow cavity devices or other types of electronic components and may also lift components completely off of their circuit boards.

In addition during the potting process the potting material may seep into the open spaces between the leads of the chips and also underneath the chip packaging. The potting material that has seeped into these areas will create residual stresses in the solder joints and also against the packaging bottom surface after the potting material has solidified during the curing process.

Currently the following failures have been observed for potted electronics during either the temperature cycling qualification process or the life test temperature cycling and gun launch of a sub system of the fielded artillery system 

The application of a barrier such as a thin layer of polymer or other material over the electronic components prior to the addition of the potting material is believed necessary to help mitigate the above failures. The polymer layer can be applied by various processes such as heat vacuum vacuum plug assist radio frequency forming or a combination of processes or a combination of the above.

For failures resulting from the solder joints failure and components being pulled off their circuit board assemblies during temperature cycling the polymer layer would prevent the potting material from intruding between the chip leads and also under the chips and thus help prevent the push and pull stresses that the potting material would produce as it expands and contracts with increasing decreasing temperatures.

For failure resulting from both lids and lid seals being cracked on hollow cavity devices the polymer layer would provide 1 a low adhesion boundary between the potting material and the lid surfaces thereby mitigating the high shear stresses that would develop as the potting material expands and contracts due to ambient temperature fluctuation and 2 a compliant layer that would minimize the high compression stresses that the potting material develops when it expands due to increasing temperatures and high tension stresses that the potting material develops when it shrinks due to decreasing temperatures against the lids of these devices.

What is therefore needed is a process of forming and emplacing the thin polymer or other formable composite layers so as to precisely conform to the imprecise geometries of the electronic components on the circuit board assemblies despite the imprecise geometries of these components due to their geometrical tolerance placement tolerance as well as the manufacturing and assembly variances of the circuit board assemblies. It would also be substantially advantageous that the polymer layers be sufficiently strong to provide the structural support of the potting to the circuit board assemblies during high g force events. It would further be desirable to have the thin polymer layers be sufficiently flexible to allow for differentials in coefficients of thermal expansion between the circuit board assemblies and the potting material.

Certain publications such as U.S. Pat. No. 5 318 855 propose a method to vacuum form a polymer film over the circuit board assemblies to provide electrical and environmental protection. However the proposed method does not seem to allow the polymer layer to precisely conform to the electronic components.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 959 752 and 4 768 286 suggest vacuum forming polymer layers over a circuit board assembly to closely conform to the geometry of the circuit board assembly prior to the application of the potting material. However these layers must be thin enough to permit vacuum forming over the circuit board assemblies and are therefore too thin to provide sufficient structural support or to provide sufficient boundary to differential thermal expansion.

Another process of forming multiple layer films into packages to protect printed circuit boards is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 161 092. This patent generally describes a method of forming a plurality of layers to cover the approximate shape of a printed circuit board assembly as opposed to mounting the electronic components in a container or enclosure. This method describes the bonding of at least three layers i.e. insulating conductive and abrasion protection into a conformal film that can be stamped or pressed and then adhered to the electronic component assemblies which may require breather valves. The surface tension of the individual layers usually provides an approximate fit that is a fit with substantial radii or a loose fit encapsulating technique.

What is therefore needed is a process of forming the layers without the need for bonding individual layers together and that produces a very tight fit between the polymer layers and the circuit board assembly. In addition desirable process would not require adhesives or melting operations to join the layers to the circuit board assembly and would provide an exacting polymer layer fit that facilitates snapping of the polymer layer to the assembly it is designed to protect. Such a desirable process would provide a polymer layer that follows the contours or profiles of all the electronic components on the circuit board assembly and would allow for variances in dimensional tolerances placement and assembly. Prior to the advent of the present invention the need for such a protective layering process has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and describes an improved protective layering process that protects electronics components with complex and imprecise geometries. The protective layering process uses a combination of a flexible mold and or a rigid mold that apply close forming encapsulating polymer layers or other composite layers created from other formable materials to the electronic components.

The imprecise geometries are due to the normal electronic component geometrical tolerances as well as position variations inherent in the manufacturing processes of the circuit board assemblies. It is an objective of the present invention to provide molding tools and forming methodologies that apply equal pressure which will make the protective layers tightly fit to the electronic components of the circuit board assemblies even perpendicular to the direction of molding. The soft durometer of the flexible mold face will flow or deform around individual components applying force on sides of components in addition to the projected or top surfaces of components. This dual material mold design is ideally suited to form polymer layers or other formable composite over electronic devices with varying tolerances.

To this end the present invention includes a method for encapsulating a circuit board assembly for enhanced survivability in harsh and extreme environments with a thin polymer layer or other composited layers created from other formable materials tightly fit to the possible imprecise as built geometries of a populated circuit board assembly. By precision scanning a circuit board assembly and using the derived data a male and or a female mold can be created which is a substantially exact representation of the geometries of a completed circuit board assembly.

The data may be adjusted to scale the pattern and therefore the associated mold to allow for layer thicknesses to form multiple successively larger layers which may include thermally conductive electromagnetic shielding layers layers for impact protection environmental protection which may be placed on top of the first layer to account for associated mold shrinkage production polymer layer or other formable composite layers shrinkage or for other reasons.

The polymer layer may be heated and a vacuum may be drawn through the mold pulling the heated layer into a substantially precise representation of the circuit board assembly. The mold may also be heated which allows for better temperature control of the thin polymer layer as it is formed as opposed to an unheated mold or as opposed to forming the layer directly against the circuit board assembly.

This forming or molding process allows for a substantially precise layer or layers to be produced using a broad range of materials including such materials that may not be formed directly against the circuit board assembly. Formed layers may be applied to the circuit board assembly by physical emplacement with the aid of heat and or air pressure with a precisely formed rigid mold or with the aid of a conformal mold or by a combination of rigid and conformal molds.

The conformal mold may have a rigid backing or reinforcement layer heated or unheated and a soft front layer which substantially matches the various geometries of the circuit board assembly. When pressure is applied and the soft conformal mold comes in contact with polymer covered circuit board assembly components and is forced to flow or deform around individual components the mold applies force on the sides of components as well as to the projected or top surfaces of the electronic components. The result of compressing the conformal mold over the polymer layer and the circuit board assembly is a protective layer that is tightly fitted to all components.

This method of encapsulating the circuit board assembly is particularly advantageous to create a barrier layer between the circuit board assembly and the potting compound which may be applied on top of the thin layer. As stated earlier the polymer layer is precisely formed to the imprecise as built geometries of the circuit board assembly.

The polymer layer may be fabricated to be both flexible enough to protect the circuit board assembly from damage caused by differentials in coefficients of thermal expansion due to environment temperature fluctuations between the circuit board assembly and the potting material without any appreciable degradation in the structural support provided to the circuit board assembly by the potting materials during extreme high g force events.

These and other advantages and features of the present invention will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention that is provided in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

The process generally comprises two phases a mold making phase as further illustrated in and and a polymer layer forming phase or as further illustrated in and . These phases and and will now be described in greater detail.

At step of and as further illustrated in the main circuit board assembly to be protected is separated from auxiliary boards and connections.

At step and as further illustrated in the circuit board assembly is scanned. A point cloud file is then created from the scanned image. A white light laser computer tomography device CT scan may be used to trace the intricate physical geometries of the circuit board assembly and to record all its features in the electronic point cloud file . The point cloud scan file geometric points is converted into a data or surface file by grouping the points into surfaces which are also blended or stitched together to form a single computer aided design CAD file.

At step the data surface file is enlarged to another surface file in order to accommodate for shrinkages of pattern s mold s and the protective films that will be deposited at a later stage of the phase . In an exemplary embodiment the data surface file was enlarged i.e. grown by approximately 0.012 in to accommodate for the shrinkage of the cast aluminum mold approximately 0.009 in and also for the shrinkage of the plastic films approximately 0.003 .

At step the enlarged surface file may be converted to a STEP or layer file to facilitate printing of the enlarged model by a SLA stereo lithography machine or other rapid prototyping or model printing machines.

At step a negative or cavity plaster mold is created. illustrates one such plaster mold . More specifically in the exemplary embodiment stereo lithography pattern was used to create the plaster mold . A core box with sprue and runner was added to the plaster negative mold to enable positive metal casting using the plaster cavity mold. The plaster negative was oven dried after it was cast.

At step a positive male metal mold is made from the plaster cavity mold . The male mold is also referred to as a drape mold. illustrates one such metal mold . In the present exemplary embodiment molten aluminum was poured into the plaster negative mold to make the aluminum positive mold . The aluminum positive mold is wire brushed and cleaned.

At step and as illustrated in several holes i.e. are drilled in the aluminum positive mold of so the mold is capable of plastic forming. The holes will enable vacuum suction of the polymer films that will be deposited according to phase of . In the exemplary embodiment the aluminum mold is wire drilled electrical discharge machined EDM to provide the holes for pulling a vacuum or vacuum forming of the thin polymer films.

One or more polymer layers can now be applied to the circuit board assembly by forming the thin layers on a drape mold also called a male mold or a cavity mold also called a female mold . The precise fit of the layers to the circuit board assembly can be formed on metallic molds that are duplicate copies of the circuit board assembly . The accuracy of the mold is a result of the scanning and printing process described earlier which provides a mold geometry that is more accurate than machining and which includes even the smallest of features and textures. Using a metallic mold enables precise control of heating and cooling that was not possible when using circuit board assemblies or printed wiring boards as forms or molding tools.

With reference to it illustrates the polymer layer forming phase of the layering process of according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The phase summarizes the process of forming one or multiple polymer layers that are also referred to as protective jackets to the circuit board assembly with vacuum.

The phase enables a manufacturer to furnish thin film polymer layers for the supplied circuit board assembly in a number of thermoplastic materials. The polymer layers act as a barrier for a variety of potting materials used to encapsulate the circuit board assembly to fill undesirable voids and to adapt to discrepancies in the geometries of the electronic components of the circuit board assembly .

At step of the polymer layer forming phase of a thin thermoplastic sheet is clamped or affixed to a rigid frame of the forming machine not shown . While the thermoplastic sheet is still affixed to the rigid frame it is heated at step under quartz lamps until it softens. The thermoplastic sheet will sag when heated providing a visual that the thermoplastic sheet is ready to be formed. The heating temperature of the thermoplastic sheet varies with the material used. As an example surface temperatures may vary between approximately 200 F. and 240 F. The heating step may for example take between approximately 20 to 40 seconds.

At step the thermoplastic sheet is moved or lowered over the drape or male mold . A machine slide enables the precise placement of the thermoplastic sheet film over the mold . As further illustrated in the heated and softened thermoplastic sheet is lowered over the mold and pushed down past the mold to ensure a tight fit to the geometries of the electronic components of the circuit board assembly as replicated on the male mold .

At step vacuum pressure of for example approximately 31 lbs. gauge is applied through the vacuum holes to pull the thermoplastic sheet further around all the intricate features of the electronic components of the circuit board assembly .

At step the thermoplastic sheet is allowed to cool on the mold using fan forced room temperature air. The cooling step would take approximately 20 seconds. The frame of the molding machine containing the cooled formed thermoplastic sheet or envelope is raised.

At step the thermoplastic envelope is released from the frame and any excess material of the thermoplastic sheet trimmed.

At step the thermoplastic envelope is placed on the circuit board assembly and secured thereto. The enveloped circuit board assembly is shown in and is designated by the numeral .

The polymer layer forming phase may be repeated to form multiple layers on the circuit board assembly . The polymer layer forming phase offers a method of applying thin polymer layers over the electronic components of circuit board assemblies which fit accurately around all components. The thin polymer layer s will have uniform thickness and consistent quality across the entire part as required by the application.

With reference to it illustrates a polymer layer forming phase of the layering process of according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The phase summarizes the process of forming one or multiple polymer layers that are also referred to as protective jackets to the circuit board assembly with vacuum.

At step a thin thermoplastic sheet is clamped or affixed to a rigid frame of the forming machine not shown . While the thermoplastic sheet is still affixed to the rigid frame it is heated at step under quartz lamps until it softens. As indicated earlier the thermoplastic sheet will sag when heated providing a visual that the thermoplastic sheet is ready to be formed. The heating temperature of the thermoplastic sheet varies with the material used. As an example surface temperatures may vary between approximately 200 F. and 240 F. The heating step may for example take between approximately 20 to 40 seconds.

At step the thermoplastic sheet is moved or lowered over the drape or male mold . A machine slide enables the precise placement of the thermoplastic sheet film over the mold .

At step and as further illustrated in the heated and softened thermoplastic sheet is lowered over the mold and pushed down past the mold to ensure a tight fit to the geometries of the electronic components of the circuit board assembly as replicated on the male mold .

At step vacuum pressure of for example approximately 31 lbs. gauge is applied through the vacuum holes to pull the thermoplastic sheet further around all the intricate features of the electronic components of the circuit board assembly . This step results in a preformed thermoplastic envelope or layer .

At step a heated negative mold is pressed against the preformed thermoplastic envelope and the mold to further increase resolution fitment including undercuts. The negative mold is then removed and the thermoplastic envelope is allowed to cool on the mold using fan forced room temperature air at step . The cooling step would take approximately 20 seconds.

At step the thermoplastic envelope is released from the mold and any excess material of the thermoplastic sheet trimmed.

At step the thermoplastic envelope is placed on the circuit board assembly and secured thereto by for example a layer of adhesive that can be applied to either the thermoplastic envelope or the circuit board assembly or both . The enveloped circuit board assembly is shown in and is designated by the numeral . The polymer layer forming phase may be repeated to form multiple layers on the circuit board assembly .

With reference to it illustrates a polymer layer forming phase of the layering process of according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The phase summarizes the process of forming one or multiple polymer layers to the circuit board assembly with pressure.

With further reference to the polymer layer forming phase provides an alternative method of forming a thermoplastic or polymer layer using a heated female tool or negative cavity mold that is oriented to face in the downward position facing the polymer layer . The negative mold includes heat or air channels that are switchable from pulling vacuum to applying air pressure.

Heated molds are sometimes oriented facing downward also referred to as upside down . The main reason for this orientation is that the conveyor feed where the items such as circuit board assemblies can be dropped into nests and remain in their position under the effect of gravity. Once in the forming machine the circuit board assembly is raised up into the cavities for over molding dropped back down on the conveyor and the cycle is repeated. Most often the male or female molds are on a work surface facing upward as vacuum is normally mounted below the machine. In addition molds lower on a surface and facing upward provide a line of sight into the mold so that the operators can monitor the complete process.

The topography of the negative mold includes cavities and small features that correspond to the geometries of the components of the positive mold and the circuit board assembly . The phase can form polymer layers in a single operation or it can be used as a secondary operation to press fit polymer layers formed by the other forming methods such as methods or over existing circuit board assemblies or printed circuit boards.

One aspect of the polymer layer forming phase is to have layers of various thicknesses and polymer composition be superposed and fit tightly over the electronic components of the circuit board assembly . By forming the layers to the geometry of the electronics components a barrier is created to separate the circuit board assembly from potting materials. Potting materials are used to encapsulate the sensitive electronics and cast them into a solid body.

The polymer layer barriers prevent potting materials from flowing underneath small electronic chips or components where they can be lifted off the printed circuit boards due to thermal movement among the dissimilar materials. The polymer barrier layers further protect the electronic components during manufacturing assembly and further during the storage life and product use from potting liquids moisture contaminants dust and corrosion.

At step the heated thermoplastic sheet is applied to the negative mold . At step vacuum pressure is used to pull the heated thermoplastic sheet tightly into the cavities and small features of the negative mold in order to produce a preformed thermoplastic envelope .

The heated thermoplastic sheet conforms very accurately to the shape placement and geometry of the electronic components. As a result the present phase addresses problems associated with the underside and vertical surfaces of the thermoplastic sheet and how closely if covers each electronic component. In order to accurately form the underside and internal sides of the thermoplastic sheet a drape or male mold is used in addition to the female mold also referred to as cavity mold or appearance mold . A female mold may be used if surfaces of the mold need to be machined to produce larger parts. Female tools are considered steel safe because sections of the mold may be removed to accommodate larger electronic components.

At step and while the preformed thermoplastic envelope is still positioned at least in part within the negative mold the positive Mold or alternatively the circuit board assembly is then moved into the cavities of the negative mold in such a way as to sandwich the thermoplastic envelope therebetween. This step will ensure that the thermoplastic envelope completely encases the geometries of components that are being protected.

While the thermoplastic envelope is still warm the positive mold is clamped in place to the negative mold . The air direction in the negative mold is then reversed to press the thermoplastic envelope tightly over the geometries of the clamped positive mold .

At step the thermoplastic envelope is then allowed to cool and to shrink over the components geometries of the positive mold that correspond to the electronics components of the circuit board assembly . The thermoplastic envelope is cooled to a specific temperature in order to hold its shape and to prevent distortion.

At step and as illustrated in the thermoplastic envelope is released from the mold and any excess material of the thermoplastic envelope is trimmed. As an example the outside edges of the thermoplastic envelope are trimmed to the shape of the circuit board assembly . Temperature sensitive tape may be employed to bond the edges of the thermoplastic envelope shape to the flat of the circuit board .

Alternate methods of bonding the thermoplastic envelope barrier to the circuit board assembly include adhesive bonding solvent bonding to a texture and ultrasonic welding to textures or three dimensional features on the circuit board assembly . Also an undercut double bend or perimeter snap can be utilized to attach the thermoplastic envelope to the circuit board assembly similarly to hardware blister packaging or food containers.

At step the thermoplastic envelope is placed on the circuit board assembly and secured thereto by for example a layer of adhesive that can be applied to either the thermoplastic envelope or the circuit board assembly or both . The enveloped circuit board assembly is shown in and is designated by the numeral . The polymer layer forming phase may be repeated to form multiple layers on the circuit board assembly .

The phase is also applicable to solve potential circuit board assembly electromagnetic interference EMI problems and may include the following steps 

1 Application of an insulation layer to the components section or assembly requiring protection. The layers will be tightly fit around components.

2 Application of an electrically conductive shielding product to the top of the first layer. These materials include metal foils metalized fabrics or cloth metal particle polymer composites plated fiber composites vacuum metalized layers electroless plated layers etc.

3 Solder or mechanically attach the shielding material to the ground features on the circuit board assembly .

In situations where the electronic devices of the circuit board assembly have very high heat dissipation generation the following step will be added prior to the application of the electrically conductive shielding product to the top of the first layer 

Cut the non conductive layers around the periphery of the hot electronic component and remove the non conductive cutout. Replace the removed non conductive layers with high thermal conductive material or pad to transfer heat away from the electronic component.

It is an objective of the conformal mold to provide a molding tool that applies equal pressure to the electronic components of the circuit board assembly including surfaces that are perpendicular to the direction of forming or molding . The soft or flexible durometer of the flexible e.g. compliant mold face will allow the polymer to flow or deform around individual electronic components and the application of a force on the sides of the electronic components as well as to the projected or top surfaces of the electronic components. This dual layer soft rigid mold design is suited to form polymer layers over electronic devices with varying tolerances.

While soft presses are known to conform polymer layers to the circuit board assembly as in U.S. Pat. No. 7 752 751 they have not been of substantially flat nature and have not been shaped to substantially match the shape of the circuit board assembly . Therefore they do not apply pressure as uniformly to the polymer layer as the present invention.

The present invention includes creating the conformal or flexible face on a molding tool that will apply close forming polymer layers on the circuit board assembly . The geometric variations of the circuit board assembly include for example component placement positioning variations solder paste height variations geometrical tolerances of the electronic components and open cavity devices e.g. MEMs seal thickness variations. With all these variations the conformal mold of the present invention will provide consistent and accurate application of encapsulating polymer layers or layers over the individual electronic components.

It is an object of the phase to fabricate a conformal mold with a soft section whose shape is developed based on the combinations of the nominal dimensions of the electronic components of the circuit board assembly the electronic components geometrical tolerances and the electronic components placement variations. The conformal mold can be primarily constructed as a silicone or elastomer soft body which may be backed up by a rigid support plate or may be a shaped silicone or elastomer face on a rigid mold which follows the geometry of the circuit board assembly .

Referring now to it illustrates the conformal dual layer mold making phase of the layering process of which is also referred to as phase to distinguish this phase over the other mold making phases described herein.

At step and with further reference to the actual populated circuit board assembly or an exact replica thereof i.e. the positive mold is placed in a casing or fixture that provides for accurate positioning and orientation of the circuit board assembly .

At step and with further reference to in order to create the dual layer mold a pattern of the final circuit board assembly topography is created by applying successive patterned polymer layers to the circuit board assembly . The polymer layers are of appropriate thicknesses and flexibility so that they closely form to the topology of the electronic components. The successive layers can be applied for example with heat and vacuum from below or a heated dual layer mold and air pressure from above the circuit board assembly . Soft pads may be used to apply pressure over electronic components of the circuit board assembly . The successive polymer layers account for the actual thermoplastic sheets or layers that will formed at the later stage of the manufacturing process.

At step and with further reference to in order to prepare a cavity and shape for the soft layer of the mold the number of successive polymer layers needs to be determined. Layer count and layer thickness are dependent on several factors among which are the following the requirements of the final encapsulated circuit board assembly including environmental physical and mechanical considerations and the desired thickness of the soft layer to provide a robust forming tool while satisfying the service life expectancy. In creating the soft layer the thickness of the polymer encapsulation layers needs to compensate for the electronic components dimensional tolerances. Designing and creating the conformal mold or soft face to accommodate for component tolerance requirements ensures a constant interface pressure between the soft layer face and the polymer layers despite the geometric complexities of the electronic components.

At step and with further reference to the rigid reinforcement portion of the conformal mold is made using the fixture and the circuit board assembly with the applied polymer layers and spacing . The conformal or soft portion of the mold requires a high degree of details from the topography of the circuit board assembly such as small surface mount devices component leads white wires etc. However the rigid portion of the mold serves to strengthen the conformal face .

As such the rigid portion of the mold can be made from casting materials usually thermoset resins with metal fillers as the back or reinforcement is not expected to experience high stress or wear nor excessively high temperatures while in use. The rigid portion of the mold may have features such as dovetails or keyways to mechanically engage the flexible material soft layer when poured creating a mechanical bond between the two dissimilar materials. The casting is performed in such a way that it locates accurately with the fixture holding the circuit board assembly .

At step and with further reference to the soft compliant portion of the conformal mold is formed by placing another actual circuit board assembly or mold into the fixture and by applying a very thin polymer layer as described earlier. This polymer layer is made as thin as possible to allow for the possibility that the electronic components sizes and positions on the circuit board assembly may have ranged to their largest tolerances.

Next a mold release is applied to the polymer layer . In creating the soft mold face silicone or another suitable elastomeric material with appropriate properties is applied to the component cavities and other surfaces that will face the circuit board assembly . During the pouring or injection of the flexible material for the soft mold face the silicone or equivalent material will flow into the locking features of the rigid mold backing bonding them as a single unit. Next the combined mold is allowed to cure around the fixtured circuit board assembly . The height of the compliant mold relative to the circuit board assembly must be controlled so that the flexible mold face thickness is maintained with regard to the circuit board assembly and the electronic components thereon.

At step and with further reference to once the flexible mold face material soft layer has cured the fixture or molding tool can be separated from the circuit board assembly . The compliant mold which includes both the soft layer and the rigid backing is now ready to be used to apply the encapsulation polymer layer s to the circuit board assemblies with complex and imprecise geometries.

If the height of the electronic components exceeds formability of a selected polymer layer the circuit board assembly could optionally be encapsulated by a polymer layer with cutouts around the tall component sections. Pre formed polymer covers can be used to wrap around the tall components and joining procedures such as adhesives solvent bonding ultrasonic welding or radio frequency sealing will ensure a tight seal between the circuit board assembly polymer layer and the smaller polymer covers for the tall components.

The soft conformal mold face or layer may be made of a single material construction or multiple layers of different materials.

The conformal mold provides the ability to form or process polymer layers to a great degree of accuracy resolution and tolerance. While the forming methods and use heat vacuum and or pressure the conformal mold uses mechanical forming around the intricate components. The soft or conformal face of the conformal mold has the ability to mechanically form or shape the thermoplastic layers in addition to the vacuum or air pressure forming. The soft face of the mold is soft enough to flow around the electronic components when closed against the opposite mold or pressed tightly onto the populated circuit board assembly . In this manner the soft geometry of the compliant mold face pushes the polymer layer not only on the top surface of components but it also applies pressure to the layer on the sides of components as the compliant mold face deforms to comply with the geometries of the electronic components.

In addition the present three dimensional mechanical forming produces layers with a significant fit to the unique topology of the numerous circuit board assemblies despite minor differences on the height axial and position tolerance of soldered components.

In this particular exemplary embodiment the conductive traces include thermally conductive fillers connecting wires and embedded heating pads . One or more externally accessible pads may also be added.

While it is highly desirable to cause the conformal mold to form polymer layers around the electronic components and complex geometries the soft compliant face that has an internal heat source heat sources or conductive traces can form the parts faster and with greater accuracy. Elastomers and silicones are thermally non conductive allowing very little heat to pass through the material even in thin cross sections.

It is an objective of the invention to create conformal or soft molds that are actually thermally conductive to soften thermoplastic layer material quickly. Using gentle heat from inside the soft mold the polymer layer materials are kept in the softened state until pressure from the mold completes the forming or net shape. Air cooling or cooling systems inside the forming machine lower part temperatures to freeze the part so it can be handled and used immediately.

Exemplary mold heaters include for example a silicone pad type while cartridge heaters wire networks ceramic elements and piped fluids are alternate heating methods.

To create heat transfer from the heating elements inside the conformal mold to the polymer layers a thermally conductive mold material was developed. Thermally conductive fillers can be added to the silicone or elastomer mold materials while keeping the molds at Shore A durometers that range from 60 80. The fillers are small in size so the mold does not become too rigid and loose the conformal qualities.

Exemplary fillers include aluminum powder copper platelets alumina and boron particles ceramic whiskers metal plated graphite fibers tungsten fibers and carbon black. Various ratios of filler to mold resin could be used depending on the circuit board assembly .

The following exemplary filler composition using aluminum fillers to make the compliant molds resulted in the following 

The compliant molds and allow a uniform thickness and consistent quality of polymer layers to be applied to the surface of the circuit board assembly with complex and imprecise geometries. They also provide the numerous advantages among which are the following 

The compliant face of the mold enables forces in the X left and right and Y front and back directions in addition to the Z up and down or the directions perpendicular to the draw.

The interface pressures between the compliant face and surfaces of all the components are substantially consistent.

The compliant face of the mold will adapt to the shape of the electronic components when it is pressed against the circuit board assembly and the polymer layers and even allows the forming of polymers to minor undercuts 

The compliant face of the mold reduces the need for heavy draft used to release the encapsulated circuit board assembly from the molding tool.

The compliant material of the mold can be cast with internal air channels or voids that enable the soft mold face to expand to accommodate additional deformation and to and stretch for compliant molding of intricate geometries and geometries with a high depth to draw ratio.

The processes of forming the polymer layers according to the present invention can be done using a combination of films sometimes called cap stock in a laminate or one layer formed on top of another. Multiple polymer layers can be designed to solve a variety of load and harsh environmental problems. The following examples are provided for illustration purpose 

The present process is suited to form a non conductive layer followed by an electrically conductive layer to shield the circuit board assembly against unintended electrical transmission or infiltration. The electrically conductive or shielding layer may utilize nickel plated fibers metallic fibers conductive veils or cloth electro less nickel plating of the thermoplastic layer or vacuum deposition of metal particles on the polymer layer.

A protective barrier for extreme cold is readily accomplished using the present invention. First a non conductive layer is formed followed by a foamed layer or a layer that has a cellular structure. The air bubbles or cells from the density reduction act as an effective insulator. Wires or pads internal to the polymer layers can function as instant heaters for cold start up. Reference is made to .

Plastics offer very little conduction of heat. So many circuit board assemblies rely on metal surfaces to radiate heat away from electrical and electronic components while other assemblies use mechanical movement of air or forced convection. There will be cases where the polymer layers will be formed or molded with air channels and or wicking structures for heat pipes or heat extractors. Metal pads over components serve as thermal pick ups which then pipe the heat outside of the enclosed area or to outside air.

The following is a non exclusive list of exemplary polymers that can be used to form the thermoplastic sheets or layers polycarbonate polyethylene siloxane rubber alloy grade with added styrene polyolefin materials low density polyethylene linear low density polyethylene high density polyethylene polypropylene metalocene based polyethylene polyvinyl chloride and high impact polystyrene.

It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
