The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The aspects of the present disclosure relate generally to the field of load connection and release devices and in particular to a load connection device for multiple loads.

There are many situations in which an object or load must be securely connected or attached to another object or load. Connecting several load bearing ropes webbings cords or cables at one junction is usually accomplished using a large heavy stiff metallic shackle or link. These stiff metallic items are typically designed to be loaded in one direction for maximum capability. When connected to multidirectional loading systems bending within the metallic items is induced. To reduce the risk of fracture due to bending the connections are designed to safety limits that require them to become very large and heavy.

Referring to examples of a typical stiff metal link are shown. In the stiff metallic link is shown subject to normal loading as indicated by arrows and . Closure pin is used for attachment of slings not shown connected to a load not shown . illustrates another example of a prior art stiff metal link with multi directional loading as indicated by arrows . The loadings may also be on different planes. This type of multi directional loading causes bending stress in stiff metal link and closure pin . The bending stress can lead to damage in the stiff metal link and closure pin as well as lead to failure of one or both.

It would be advantageous to provide a multi load connection junction that is constructed of high strength flexible material where each part of the multi load connection between multi loading points can be in tension without bending or damage to the connection. Items of this type would be extremely useful in the marine and para cargo areas for example.

Accordingly it would be desirable to provide a multiple load connection junction that addresses at least some of the problems identified above.

As described herein the exemplary embodiments overcome one or more of the above or other disadvantages known in the art.

One aspect of the exemplary embodiments relates to a flexible multi load connection. In one embodiment the flexible multi load connection includes a coil of a flexible high strength cord having a loop end and two running ends a releasable connection joining the two running ends the releasable connection comprising a knot and a connecting arrangement releasably joining the loop end and the two running ends.

Another aspect of the exemplary embodiments relates to a system for releasably attaching a plurality of objects together. In one embodiment the system includes a flexible loop of a coiled cord the coiled cord comprising a loop end two running ends and a plurality of cord windings between the loop end and the two running ends a connection releasably joining the two running ends and a connecting arrangement for releasably joining the loop end and the two running ends.

A further aspect of the disclosed embodiments relates to a method of forming a high strength flexible ring for releasably attaching a plurality of objects together. In one embodiment the method includes folding a high strength flexible cord in approximately one half to form a loop end and two running ends coiling the cord to form a plurality of windings of the cord releasably securing the two running ends together and releasably securing the loop end to the secured running ends.

These and other aspects and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood however that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention for which reference should be made to the appended claims. Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows and in part will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. Moreover the aspects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

Referring to an exemplary multiple or multi load connection system incorporating aspects of the present disclosure and will be generally designated by reference numeral . The aspects of the disclosed embodiments are directed to a multiple load connection made of a flexible material that can be placed in tension without bending or related damage.

As shown in in one embodiment the multiple load connection comprises a flexible continuous ring . The ring is generally formed from a number of windings of cord material or cord . The cord generally comprises a high strength cord fiber or material examples of which include polycarbonate or Aramid or any combination thereof. For example in one embodiment the cord comprises a nylon fiber or cord. In an alternate embodiment the cord comprises one or more of a Kevlar or Spectra fiber material. In alternate embodiments any suitable high strength cord can be used.

In the example of the ring is shown as a substantially circular member. In alternate embodiments the ring can be any suitable shape other than including circular. The diameter of the ring is generally dependent upon and will be sized to accommodate the dimensions of the connecting members not shown . As shown in the flexible continuous ring includes windings of the cord passing through a protective jacket which in one embodiment is flexible. A connecting arrangement or connection is used to coupled or connect the ends of the windings together in a secure and releasable manner as will otherwise be described herein.

Referring to fabrication of the flexible continuous ring comprises selection of an appropriate length and strength cord or line generally referred to herein as cord . The selection of the appropriate length and strength cord can depend on any one of a number of factors and will vary depending upon the particular application examples of which can include but are not limited to parachute lines and lifting straps. The weights and capacities can range from the tens of pounds to the thousands of pounds. The size of the ring will vary with the particular application.

As is illustrated in in this example the cord is folded approximately in half. This produces a loop end and running ends . When folded over a coil is formed as is shown in . Each fold or each coil will result in two cord parts shown together in as . In the case of two coils there will be four cord parts shown as . In the example of a number of coils are formed generally referred to as coils . The coils are formed into a loop of coils as is shown in . Each time the cord is folded over another coil is formed. In a single coil is shown. illustrates the formation of multiple coils .

As illustrated in the cord is formed into a loop of coils that are used to form the windings . As illustrated in the cord is coiled to provide a desired number of coils corresponding to a pre determined number of windings also referred to as cord parts. The number of windings is generally based on the needed strength for the particular job or application. For example in one embodiment the number of windings needed is based on the load or the weight that is to be supported or lifted and the strength of the cord. An exemplary formula for determining the number of windings is L T C 0.5 where L is the desired loop strength Tis the tensile strength of the cord and Cis the material coefficient. The loop strength is a function of the number of loop parts multiplied by the desired weight to be support. For example two coils of the loop results in four cord parts . If the desired weight to be supported is 1000 lbs the loop strength is 4 1000 4000. The material coefficient Cis generally a pre determined value. One common value for the material coefficient is 0.40. The loop of coils is then closed by connecting the loop end to the running ends and as will be described further herein.

Referring to one embodiment of a connecting arrangement or closure for connecting the running ends to the loop end is illustrated. In this example the running ends are interlaced or interwoven with respective portions of the loop end . The end portions of the running ends are then securely coupled or connected together. In one embodiment the end portions are connected together using a water knot as such is generally known and understood. In alternate embodiments the end portions can be connected together in any suitable manner using any suitable knot or mechanical connector. The aspects of the disclosed embodiments allow the loop end to be secured to and easily released from the running ends .

Referring to another embodiment of a closure incorporating aspects of the present disclosure is illustrated. In this embodiment the loop end from end of the protective ring can be readily connected to and released from the running ends from end of protective ring . As shown in the running ends are coupled together with a knot which in this embodiment comprises a Parachute Riggers Rip Cord Knot as is generally known in the art. In this example the loop end is brought through and between the running ends just below the knot . The loop end is then inserted into the opening and brought up and over the knot . The loop end is tightened or cinches around the knot as is shown in .

The aspects of the disclosed embodiments advantageously provide a high strength flexible connection for coupling multiple loads together. The flexible connection of the disclosed embodiments can be formed without the need for stitching and splicing and the connection can be created anywhere.

Thus while there have been shown described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to the exemplary embodiments thereof it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of devices and methods illustrated and in their operation may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Moreover it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Moreover it should be recognized that structures and or elements and or method steps shown and or described in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice. It is the intention therefore to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto.
