The present U.S. Utility Patent Application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 e to the following U.S. Provisional Patent Application which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility Patent Application for all purposes 

1. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 545 147 entitled Social Network Device Memberships and Resource Allocation filed Oct. 8 2011.

The invention relates generally to social networking and more particularly it relates to social network device registration service and support via group associations.

The popularity and growth of social network sites and services has increased dramatically over the last few years. Present social network sites include Facebook Google Twitter MySpace YouTube LinkedIn Flicker Jaiku MYUBO Bebo and the like. Such social networking SNET sites are typically web based and organized around user profiles and or collections of content accessible by members of the network. Membership in such social networks is comprised of individuals or groupings of individuals who are generally represented by profile pages and permitted to interact as determined by the social networking service.

In many popular social networks especially profile focused social networks activity centers on web pages or social spaces that enable members to view profiles communicate and share activities interests opinions status updates audio video content etc. across networks of contacts. Social networking services might also allow members to track certain activities of other members of the social network collaborate locate and connect with existing friends former acquaintances and colleagues and establish new connections with other members.

Individual members typically connect to social networking services through existing web based platforms via a computing device tablet or smartphone. Members often share a common bond social status or geographic or cultural connection with their respective contacts. Smartphone and games based mobile social networking services are examples of rapidly developing areas.

In so called cloud computing computing tasks are performed on remote computers servers which are typically accessed via Internet connections. One benefit of cloud computing is that may reduce the relative processing and storage capabilities required by user devices e.g. a cloud computer may load a webpage accessed by a tablet device and communicate only required information back to the tablet . Accordingly recent years have witnessed an ever growing amount of content and application software being migrated from local or on site storage to cloud based data storage and management. Such software functionality services and content are typically available on demand via virtualized network infrastructures.

As used herein the terms social network and SNET comprise a grouping or social structure of devices and or individuals as well as connections links and interdependencies between such devices and or individuals. Members or actors including devices within or affiliated with a SNET may be referred to herein as nodes social devices SNET members SNET devices user devices and or modules . In addition the terms SNET circle SNET sub circle SNET group and SNET sub group generally denote a social network that comprises social devices and as contextually appropriate human SNET members and personal area networks PANs .

Briefly various novel approaches are presented herein for servicing and supporting social devices including through automatic SNET group association processes. Such processes may comprise for example automatically offering upon docking of a device to a user account in a SNET device registration service support user to user interaction updates etc. via the SNET group. Currently such services and activities are typically performed manually without a common infrastructure and therefore often do not occur or do not occur in a timely manner.

In one exemplary method for providing such services through SNET group association upon activating or docking a new user device the user s account information is provided to the SNET group automatically or via a setup up prompt. Next the device receives an offer to auto join the SNET group such as a manufacturer s SNET group specific to a particular device model. Acceptance of the offer adds or docks the device as a member to one or more of an operator s or manufacturer s SNET groups to provide for example access to registration warranty rebate information and extended warranty offers testing update and service offerings usage tutorials and user group interactions periodic testing configuration analysis and ad hoc updates and upgrades targeted advertising tracking of in service devices detection of service problems etc. Certain groups may similarly include offerings such as rebate information coupons forums Twitter Skype and or various social media capabilities and the like. User devices may be configured manually or through factory staged settings and security to delegate membership control to a SNET or SNET group.

For many user devices operations such as initial setup reconfiguration driver and application maintenance and installation media and data management etc. often prove to be very difficult and time consuming. Such operations may pose a significant barrier for certain device users such as the elderly or children. In one embodiment a user may rely on assistance from others by granting access to a device to for example a technical support group or friends group for purposes of device setup maintenance and management. Relevant groups may include a trouble shooting group IT help group providing e.g. data backup or application installation support theme support group advertising group storage management group monitoring group e.g. a baby monitor device accessible by family members or caregivers etc. A user s profile information and device capabilities and or access views may be visible to such groups.

In an alternate embodiment described more fully in conjunction with a user device is effectively cloned by another user via a SNET group. In yet another embodiment of the disclosure a SNET and social device are configured to detect monitor and or report the usage of certain technology and media for purposes of establishing an independent basis for royalty assessment. Various other novel features are described herein.

Referring more specifically to a social network group circle hereinafter SNET group or SNET circle comprising fixed and intelligent social services is shown. Briefly membership in the SNET group may comprise fixed and intelligent social services docked social devices resources embodiments of which are described in conjunction with and human SNET group members as well as proxies thereof. Further SNET group nodes may include support services and software e.g. applications of various types participating as members. By way of example SNET group members might include artificial intelligence agents social robots SNET security device s appliances vehicles and service providers external social device resources common or authorized members functionality of other SNET groups etc. Further access to specific content and resources of a SNET group may be shared with members of additional SNET s including remote or web based applications. Such access can be conditioned on acceptable profiling and association data. Similarly social devices or individuals may be granted temporary or ad hoc memberships with or without restricted access.

In the illustrated embodiment formation maintenance and operation of SNET group is performed by standalone or distributed SNET processing circuitry and software . It is noted that the SNET processing circuitry may comprise hardware software applications or various combinations thereof and be configurable to support various functionalities disclosed herein. Further the SNET processing circuitry may be included in a standalone server server farm cloud based resources and or the various types of devices described below and incorporate authentication and security functionality . In addition specialized middleware may also be utilized by SNETs according to the disclosure including standardized middleware and or standardized communication protocols having an associated certification process. Interactions and interdependencies within the SNET group may involve one or more of an adaptive resource management allocation and arbitration module a social device association control module or docking service and a SNET group member profiling module .

As described more fully below distribution of internal and external SNET data content can be accomplished in a variety of ways in accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure. For example data distribution may involve an adaptive or parallel network communication routing infrastructure involving a wide variety of communication protocols and wired and or wireless communications channels as well as one or more social devices resources . SNET data content may comprise for example various user driven advertising channels pictures videos audio communications links online text etc. Access to such content as well as communications with and remote access to docked social devices resources of the SNET group may occur over an Internet backbone cellular communication system WAN LAN etc.

A member of a SNET in accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure such as those disclosed herein may establish permissions and or privacy settings that control and restrict who or what may access the member s profile s information offer services communication resources connections and groups as well as define desired degrees of access. Permissions may enable the user to maintain certain resources or information as private or available on a permissive basis only. For example accessibility to available communication resources or social content may be limited to users devices in a particular SNET or SNET group. Alternatively such resources may be publicly available. Likewise a SNET member may selectively decide to permit others to access personal information such as name gender contact information email address etc.

In the various embodiments membership in a SNET group may be extended to encompass public and private social devices and equipment. For example in a SNET group that includes human members each human member may have a respective personal SNET sub group of associated or docked social devices capable of independent or aggregated participation in the SNET group. The SNET sub group may be locally or remotely accessible by a human member and or other SNET group sub group members through various means such as clicking on an icon or tag associated with the human member personal sub group. A SNET group may be persistent or of limited duration and include ad hoc and or static associations.

Exemplary social devices may be broadly categorized as either i social devices that include a user or SNET group interface sufficient to provide meaningful input to SNET interaction and ii social devices that support minimal or no user input relevant to SNET interaction. More particularly and without limitation the first category may include computers tablet devices IPTVs IPTV set top boxes smart phones servers laptops cloudbooks network attached storage devices gaming consoles media players sources communication nodes access points routers switches gateways etc. user interface devices power line communication PLC devices etc. Such social devices may receive user input for SNET setup and management. The second category may include again without limitation printers projectors cameras and camcorders scanners speakers headsets smoke detectors alarm systems video cameras mice etc. In general dockable social devices include any electronic device that could be operably coupled to or docked in a SNET group sub group via wired or wireless pathways to participate as a SNET member.

As will be appreciated by docking social devices members of a SNET group may gain full or partial remote control and interaction such devices via an authorized member SNET account. For example family members authorized to participate in a family SNET group may remotely access docked social devices via one or more associated SNET accounts. Exemplary methods for docking and accessing social devices are described more fully below in conjunction with numerous of the Figures. Other capabilities according to various embodiments of the disclosure include numerous novel features and attributes as described more fully below and with general reference to .

In the illustrated embodiment social system members or nodes include one or more local or remote servers and server clusters that provide a support infrastructure supporting system for social group functionality and member operations routing data storage services docakable services etc. . Communications within the social group and with non members may occur via dedicated or multi function communication path devices.

Social system members further include devices configured to operate as nodes within the social group . Social functionality in such devices and other social system members can be implemented through various means. For example a device may have integral hardware firmware software to support social group access and member operations. Alternatively a general purpose device may include social code that enables participation in the social group . In a further embodiment a device designed to include social functionality may participate in the social group through a combination of non social code and a social shim layer or driver wrapper. In yet another embodiment a member device having a social design may utilize additional social code including code specific to a social group .

Participation in the social group is supported through functionality that includes automated and member triggered membership invitations and processing membership management . More particularly membership management may function to invite prospective members to participate in the social group through automatic automated and member triggered processes. For example membership management might be configured by a human user to establish or modify a social group by automatically inviting accepting social system members having certain characteristics such as new devices owned or controlled by the user or acquaintances of the user .

Processing of accepted invitations and unsolicited requests to join the social group may be conditioned upon input or authorization from an existing social system member s or social device e.g. through a user input interface . Similarly membership management may be configured to generate automated suggestions regarding which prospective members receive an invitation. Various other approaches such as those described herein can be used to establish membership in accordance with the disclosure.

Access to and visibility of resources of a social group including services and data may be managed through general and member class specific access configurations . For example if membership in the social group includes family members and associated devices a uniform access configuration or separate device and human configurations could be applied across the class in an automatic or automated manner. In other embodiments access control and constraints are imposed on a per member basis. In the illustrated embodiment social devices include one or more of access rules device or user identification information applications and services and user input interfaces .

The social group may offer a wide variety of configuration and support services including both internal and external services accessible by social system members . By way of example and in addition to the support services described elsewhere the social group may offer payment processing services storage and backup services robotic control functions digital assistants and other services certain of which may themselves participate as members between full members and or authorized guest members and visitors. In certain embodiments configuration and support services may themselves participate or be selectable to participate as members of the social group . As with other resources of the social group access control and constraints on configuration and support services may be applied to individual members or classes of members.

The SNET infrastructure of the illustrated embodiment includes a number of functions and resources to support formation and maintenance of a SNET having social device and or service members. In particular member report management and processing receives information from SNET group member reporting functions in associated social devices . Such information may include for example status data regarding technology usage location address and activities of a social device and or device user.

In addition the social device may provide device information indicating for example device functions and social capabilities as well as configuration and servicing needs relating thereto device model number s device configurations software versions attached peripherals and downstream social devices device resources and usage etc. Such information may be preloaded in a device and modified on a dynamic basis. Device information relating to available resources services and current resource usage may be utilized by the SNET infrastructure for purposes of SNET resource configuration and management.

In various embodiments the social device may have an obligation to gather store and or report device status or usage information at different times. For example reporting may be required upon affiliation or docking with a SNET on a predetermined or configurable periodic basis and or during operational engagements with other intra and inter SNET resources and devices including upstream and downstream devices.

Referring again to the SNET infrastructure additional functionality and resources include without limitation SNET member information capture and storage management a SNET application programming interface API that allows SNET associated software components to communicate with each other security and access control management for maintaining the integrity of the SNET and affiliated data resources and Web server services . The social network infrastructure further comprises other group applications and services corresponding to the foregoing as well as additional services such as those described herein. In one exemplary embodiment the SNET infrastructure might determine e.g. by means of device information the category and nature of a social device wishing to participate in a SNET. As necessary functionality in the SNET infrastructure could then direct or trigger installation of appropriate application software and underlying drivers in the social device . Such operations might be performed with minimal involvement from inherent functions of the social device .

In the illustrated embodiment the social device comprises a number of additional functions and resources to support participation in a social network. More particularly SNET group and member control functions including device configuration and support functions may include slave functions master functions and various combinations thereof. Slave functions include for example device re configuration directed resource allocation managed resource arbitration bridging operations etc. Master functions enable the social device to establish manage and terminate various interactions between nodes or groups of nodes in a social network including interactions involving the social device itself.

The social device further includes a social API and browser based interaction capabilities to support for example relevant installed or preloaded social applications and services which might comprise slave and master functions and . Security and access control layers permit the social device to interface with or establish secure SNET groups circles and control access to internal and external SNET resources.

It is noted that numerous of the functional building blocks of the embodiment of the disclosure illustrated by may be incorporated in whole or part in one or more application specific integrated circuit devices. For example an integrated circuit device may include a member reporting module to provide member reporting functionality including communication of device status and device characteristics device control capabilities master slave functions security and access control modules etc. Such an integrated circuit device may also include onboard processing capabilities and or interface with a processor device. Alternatively several of the functions described above may be incorporated in whole or part into an operating system and or software loaded above an operating system kernel.

In some embodiments one or more infrastructures are managed by one or more processing systems computers server devices network nodes social devices services or some combination thereof. For example in the illustrated embodiment some or all of the service SNET infrastructure one or more client SNET infrastructures and or some combination thereof may be managed by one or more social service support devices one or more client social devices and or some combination thereof. Processing systems can include without limitation one or more instances of processing circuitry distributed across one or more server devices or network nodes.

For example in the illustrated embodiment SNET grouping hierarchy includes a service SNET infrastructure in a first tier and multiple client SNET infrastructures and in a second tier. Infrastructures can include without limitation one or more SNET groups one or more support services applications resources devices and the like associated with one or more entities which can include without limitation clients members of a SNET nonmembers of a SNET guests of a SNET manufacturer groups service groups etc. For example service SNET infrastructure may include user devices applications and SNET groups and associated with one or more support services.

Similarly a client SNET infrastructure can include one or more client SNET groups and one or more social devices associated with one or more particular clients hereinafter referred to interchangeably as users members visitors guests and the like . For example a first client side infrastructure can include one or more SNET groups associated with a SNET member along with one or more social devices associated with the SNET member. As shown in the illustrated embodiment the social devices in a client infrastructure can be docked or otherwise affiliated with SNET groups associated with the client. In some embodiments a device or SNET group docked to another SNET group becomes a member of the SNET group to which it is docked. By docking a client social device to a client SNET group a user associated with a client SNET group may interact with the SNET group by interacting with a social device docked to the SNET group . Members clients users and the like may include without limitation human members of a SNET or some other network device members of a SNET or some other network certain fixed and intelligent services some combination thereof etc.

In some embodiments one or more capabilities which might include for example various support services applications or SNET groups are mixed combined and or merged via a docking process into one or more SNET groups that can provide access to a desired selection of capabilities through interaction with the one or more SNET groups. For example service SNET infrastructure illustrates capabilities that can be provided by various service support social user devices and or various social servicing applications . In some embodiments access to various service support social user devices either directly or through interaction with a SNET group to which the service support social user devices are docked and access to various social servicing applications either directly or through interaction with a SNET group docked to the social servicing applications can be provided to SNET members.

One or more of the capabilities provided by the devices applications and SNET groups and may be combined into a single SNET group that can provide access to one or more capabilities provided by devices services applications SNET groups or some combination thereof. For example a user of a client SNET infrastructure can by docking a social device via a docking process which may be supported by local or distributed system circuitry to a single SNET group that itself combines SNET groups and gain access to the capabilities provided by both SNET groups and by docking with SNET group .

In some embodiments access to support services and other capabilities provided by one or more SNET groups infrastructures can be accomplished by docking one SNET group to another SNET group. For example a client SNET group can be docked via a docking process to SNET group thereby enabling a user of the client side infrastructure to access the capabilities provided by SNET group through the client SNET group . In particular where one or more social devices are docked to the client SNET group a user can access the capabilities provided by SNET group via one or more of the social devices that are docked with the client SNET group .

In some embodiments docking SNET groups such that a user member client or the like can access capabilities provided by various services devices and SNET groups associated with various SNET infrastructures enhances security. For example where a user associated with a first client SNET infrastructure can only access capabilities provided by service SNET infrastructure by docking with SNET group various levels of security can be utilized by one or more processing systems devices associated with the service SNET infrastructure client SNET infrastructure etc. to ensure secure access to the capabilities.

In addition in some embodiments accessing capabilities provided by a SNET infrastructure by docking two or more SNET groups provides additional levels of security. For example where access to capabilities provided by service SNET infrastructure entails docking a client SNET group or the like to SNET group a more secure connection with various levels of security can be employed and access to the capabilities can be easily granted altered restricted or terminated via management of a single dock or association between a client SNET group and SNET group . A processing system device associated with the service SNET infrastructure or a client SNET infrastructure may manage the association based upon inputs received from a user a third party entity some internal logic elapse of a period of time a change in geographic location of a client social device associated with the client SNET infrastructure or some other trigger event.

In some embodiments the selection and docking process can be automated and or automatic. For example a docking process may be automatic by being triggered based upon a location of a user of an infrastructure including without limitation a geographic proximity of one or more of a user a social device associated with a user or a social device docked with a particular client SNET group . In some embodiments a user can provide one or more association rules that can provide conditions under which one or more particular client SNET groups can be docked to other SNET groups. Conditions may include for example geographic proximity of one or more social devices docked to the particular client social to a geographic location associated with a SNET group authorization by a user associated with the infrastructure SNET group or social device to dock the client SNET group with SNET group . Association rules can be communicated to a social device docked with a particular SNET group or a processing system that manages docking of various SNET groups. A processing system a social device or some combination thereof can monitor a client SNET group social device docked to the client SNET group one or more attributes of another one or more SNET groups in relation to one or more attributes of one or more client SNET groups docked social devices or the like in relation to one or more association rules in order to determine whether to dock one or more SNET groups and or social devices services together. Association rules can be altered by a user or a processing system on the fly to create new rules delete rules alter rules etc. For example a user associated with a client SNET group who may have previously communicated to a processing system an association rule that prohibits docking the client SNET group to a SNET group beyond a threshold geographic proximity to a social device can communicate on the fly an alteration of the association rule that can include for example altering the threshold geographic proximity authorizing a docking of the client SNET group to a particular SNET group on a case by case basis ordering an undocking of a client SNET group from another SNET group etc.

In some embodiments various tiers of a SNET grouping hierarchy are subject to various levels of access to information and or services. For example in the illustrated embodiment a user of the higher tier service SNET infrastructure may be able to access or view each client SNET group and associated with a lower tier client SNET infrastructure and that is docked to a SNET group associated with the social service infrastructure . A user of the service SNET infrastructure may also be able to view the various social devices and docked to the various client SNET groups and . In another example one or more users of a lower tier infrastructure including without limitation client SNET infrastructure and may be able to view some or all of the capabilities provided through a SNET group associated with a higher tier infrastructure to which a SNET group associated with the lower tier infrastructure is docked but cannot view some or all of the higher tier infrastructure including without limitation various SNET groups and from which capabilities provided by SNET group are originally provided. Additionally a user of a lower tier infrastructure accessing a SNET group associated with a higher tier service SNET infrastructure may be unable to view some or all of the other similarly lower tier client SNET infrastructures and that are also docked with the same SNET group .

In some embodiments the selection and docking process or service can be controlled or managed by one or more various social devices or processing systems. For example a processing system of a SNET infrastructure which can include one or more instances of processing circuitry distributed across one or more server devices and or network nodes may control the docking and undocking of one SNET group to another based upon a user s interaction with the SNET one or more association rules one or more inputs some internal logic etc. As another example a social device may control the docking and undocking of one or more SNET groups based upon a user s interaction with the SNET one or more association rules one or more inputs some internal logic etc. In some embodiments a processing system or social device authorized to manage a higher tier infrastructure can manage one or more attributes of access by one or more lower tier infrastructures docked to the higher tier infrastructure. For example a processing system authorized to control a higher tier social service infrastructure may alter access to certain capabilities restrict access to certain capabilities and or terminate access via undocking of SNET groups and devices based upon input or other logic operation. The processing system may determine that a trigger event e.g. all social devices docked with a client SNET group docked to SNET group have exceeded a predetermined threshold of proximity distance from a geographic location associated with SNET group has occurred and based upon the determination undock the client SNET group from SNET group partially or fully restrict access by client SNET group to certain capabilities provided by SNET group etc.

SNET group members clients users and the like may include for example human members of a SNET or some other network authorized nonmembers of a SNET guests of a SNET device members of a SNET or some other network certain support services resources some combination thereof etc. In various embodiments one or more services and capabilities associated with SNET group may be accessed directly or through interaction with the SNET group e.g. via supporting system and or a tiered SNET grouping hierarchy such as described in conjunction with . In addition SNET group may offer a series of services and or resources that become available upon docking of a particular supporting device. Such services may be visible and available across a user s SNET account to a particular SNET group circle to the functional member itself to all SNET membership etc.

In various of the illustrated embodiments for example a variety of services and resources are supported in a SNET group including support services and computing and networking elements . The SNET processing circuitry and software of the illustrated embodiments include one or more hardware software functions for managing and facilitating such services and resources. These functions may include for example fixed and intelligent service offering control capabilities which may include configurable resource offering views including visual offerings distributed process management functions DRM and billing management capabilities resource management and access control capabilities membership management docking and support services and tracking and reporting functions .

A SNET group according to the illustrated embodiments may support and offer a wide variety of support services . By way of example and without limitation maintenance services may be offered including warranty services registration and activation services updating and upgrading services and periodic testing services . Other service offerings may include device configuration services cloning services tutorial and training services user interaction support and targeted advertising services .

The support services further include resource utilization tracking and reporting services . Frequently and especially in conjunction with multi function and feature rich devices a manufacturer or service provider subject to utilization based technology licensing or royalty obligations may find it difficult to track device usage. For example a given device may incorporate multiple and alternative audio video codecs or other configurable features the use of which triggers royalty reporting obligations to a technology licensor. Similarly marketing and social media content providers frequently charge consumers or advertisers on a consumption or subscription basis or may desire usage information relevant to ratings and advertising revenue. Unfortunately the information necessary to meet such licensing obligations and needs may be very difficult to collect once a device is in service and no longer accessible by the licensee.

In order to address difficulties related to technology media usage tracking a SNET e.g. through resource utilization tracking and reporting services and social devices such as those described above may be configurable to detect monitor and or report the usage of certain technology media for purposes of establishing an independent basis for royalty assessment.

According to another embodiment of the disclosure an application docked as a SNET group member may be configured automatically as a DMZ member with underlying functionality such as a guest member having access to some SNET group resources but not others. For example in an embodiment involving gaming activities joinder of a SNET group by a gaming application and game member might result in service offerings to other SNET group members including without limitation configuration services based at least in part on underlying device limitations capabilities. Similarly docking of members may also trigger antivirus and malware detection services within the SNET group spanning all or a subset of implicated social devices services and software.

Network elements may include by way of example and without limitation network attached storage NAS firewalls and VPNs social or allocable communication resources networking communication proxies and gateways security and DRM hardware firmware robotic interfaces databases etc. Such resources may be allocated and utilized for specific purposes or in support of one or more services and distributed processes such as those described herein. Various approaches may be utilized for managing and allocating network elements as well as services and other resources.

As will be appreciated a SNET group may be configurable to perform and utilize a wide variety of functions and services including both member and non member services and selection of such services for use by a particular SNET group may occur in a variety of ways. By way of example a member device may offer a menu of available services to an affiliated human for use in selecting local or remote services for docking as a group member or otherwise activating and or configuring services. Alternatively services themselves including member services or cloud based services might generate an invitation that can be accepted by one or more SNET group members or affiliates. In other embodiments a device that incorporates a social service e.g. a social device purchased by a human member of a SNET group can be activated and docked as a member of a SNET group thereby making the social service available to other group members and affiliates. Alternatively a service incorporated in a device rather than the full device may be docked with a SNET group. Further a social service in accordance with the disclosure may have multiple portions that run on different nodes of a SNET group or SNET support infrastructure. Using a configuration service as an example a portion of such service may operate on a docked social device while other portions of the service may run on other SNET group nodes.

Referring now to a schematic block diagram is shown for a social device operable to support various interactions between other social devices and social services and systems in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The social device is configured with a variety of functions that enable it to operate in a social device hierarchy comprising social S devices social parent SP devices and social child SC devices. For example a social parent device may enable a docked social child device to access resources of the parent device and or connect to and interact with directly or indirectly with a social network. The social child device may be configured with inherent social capabilities or gain access to such capabilities from or through an associated parent device. Further a human SNET member might have associated social child devices or be served by a social parent device via a user I O interface .

A social device according to various embodiments and applications of the disclosure may also concurrently or selectively function as a social device SP device SC device or even a grandparent device that supports e.g. in a multi hop environment a parent device in a SNET group. Dynamic and static hierarchical associations between SP and SC devices may be established in a selective automatic or automated manner. Further a social device may take many forms including without limitation a smartphone personal computer server tablet device access point gateway network switch hub bridging device set top box or other device enabled with social capabilities.

In the illustrated embodiment the social device is communicatively coupled to a SNET infrastructure and or social parent system via upstream social communication interface circuitry . Likewise downstream social peer and or child communication interface circuitry enables coupling with a social child device social peer or clone device and or social parent system device . Social resources of both upstream and downstream devices may be accessible to one another via the social device .

The social device of this embodiment includes configurable social resources that along with external SNET resources are managed by a social resource management module and accessible to at least one other SNET group member. Specific configurable social resources may include user I O interfaces general purpose and dedicated hardware processing circuitry peripheral circuitry and components which may or may not have social capabilities communication bandwidth and credit determination functionality e.g. for use by payment processing services switching bridging functions application software and fixed intelligent services e.g. support services distributed remote social resource control etc. The external social resources may comprise for example an external data digital library or content from one or more of cable satellite and or terrestrial televisions systems.

Among other functions the social resource management module comprises access allocation arbitration and scheduling functionality as well as the functionality for establishing regaining and relinquishing control processing operations including operations involving access to configurable social resources . It is noted that counterpart social resource management functionality may be present in the SNET infrastructure and or other SNET nodes.

In one exemplary embodiment wherein the social device comprises a switching bridge bandwidth capacity may be dynamically allocated by access allocation arbitration and scheduling functionality . Access to bandwidth capacity and other resources of the social device might be available only upon request per access views or per allocation and arbitration functions and selectively terminated when excessive bandwidth resources are consumed or requested.

Next in step user and or device account information is provided to a SNET or SNET group either automatically or via a manual process that may involve for example a set up prompt. Communication of the account information may indicate a desire to associate dock or access support services and other group resources of a SNET group. In addition security and authentication procedures may be performed in conjunction with this or any of the steps of the illustrated method. These operations may involve multiple steps including manual human confirmation requirements.

In step the social device next receives and accepts an offer to join one or more SNET groups. As noted this may be accomplished via an automated process or partially automated process. In one exemplary embodiment a device may approach within a threshold such as a proximity threshold of an access point for a premises upon which the access point or some other device associated with the premises delivers an invitation to the device or a human user via the device to dock to a SNET group associated with the premises. The invitation can vary depending upon whether one or both the device or human user is already a member of the SNET. Where the device is not a social device the access point can deliver an invitation in the form of a web page to the device via a browser application or the like that offers the device or device user the option of joining a SNET group as an ad hoc member. Where the device is a social device the invitation can include a direct invitation to dock a SNET group with the premises associated SNET group via a social interface or user interface located within the device.

The invitation can be accepted via one of various acceptance processes. For example where a social device receives an invitation that includes a unique identifier indicating the SNET group to which the member is invited to dock the social device can interact with an access point another device a SNET SNET group SNET sub group and the like via an independent pathway to accept the invitation. Acceptance in the above example may include simply delivering the unique identifier and information identifying the device or SNET group associated with delivery of the unique identifier following which the SNET group is docked to the premises associated SNET group. In addition where a non social device attempts to access an access point and the access point pushes a web page to a browser application on the non social device the acceptance process can include accessing the web page indicating a desire to dock with the SNET group and perhaps providing other information . In response the non social device or an affiliated ad hoc guest SNET group is accepted and docked to the premises associated SNET group and can gain access to support services and servicing information provided by a premises associated SNET group.

In some embodiments upon crossing another or the same threshold docking to the SNET group can be terminated or restricted. For example where a device entering a premises is offered and accepts an ad hoc docking to a SNET group by an access point the access point may restrict or terminate the ad hoc docking upon determining that the device has left the premises.

Next in step the social device is docked e.g. online through near field communications NFC and or Bluetooth coupling or via networked operations to a SNET group. In certain embodiments such docking and membership offer processing is initiated or managed by a docking service supported by one or more nodes e.g. a server system of social networking system and or a relevant SNET group.

In some embodiments a docking link between various SNET groups and social devices services is managed based on various docking specifications. A docking specification can in some embodiments manage one or more particular docking links and specify for example and not by way of limitation access limitations restrictions and grants associated with various capabilities of a SNET group security access requirements periods of access and trigger events upon which access is to be altered restricted granted and or terminated. In some embodiments default docking specifications can apply a default treatment for access offerings interactions etc. with regard to one or more particular SNET groups but permit specific offering access modifications where needed by authorized SNET nodes and or groups. Likewise overall default treatment can be modified.

Following the docking process in step the SNET group provides access to support functions and or exchanges servicing information such as registration and warranty information based on identity data associated with the social device tutorial and user group interactions periodic testing configuration analysis and ad hoc or periodic updates upgrades targeted advertising tracking of in service device resources etc. As described more fully below the support service may also perform cloning operations such as extending device configuration data of a first device associated with the SNET group for use in configuring another device such as a device that is docked in accordance with the preceding steps. Support services can be docked to the SNET group and may run on a server system that supports the SNET group or on one or more nodes of the SNET group. By way of example upon activation or connection to a network a new device may be pre programmed to contact and join a manufacturer group a retailer group a user group an independent warranty group or some other like SNET group for purposes of registering or configuring the device. As will be appreciated an entity such as a manufacturer may also participate as a member of one or more such groups.

Subsequent provision of support services and interactions may occur in automated manner as shown in step . Alternatively one or more available support service operations may be manually selected as shown in step such as selection through interaction with a menu of services provided by a user interface. The menu of available support service operations may be determined at least in part based on the identification information associated with a particular social device. Further menu views may have varying degrees of granularity as contextually appropriate or as determined by the support service provider or user of the device.

Following selection of one or more desired support services authorized servicing information relating to such services is exchanged between the SNET SNET group and the social device in step . Such servicing information may comprise for example warranty information device activation information device configuration information device maintenance information and device testing information.

Referring now to a logic diagram is shown for a method for configuring and or cloning a social device in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In certain such embodiments a user device is effectively cloned via user interaction with a SNET group. The cloning process may expose the application and environment of one user s device to other users in a SNET group. Cloning may be conducted at multiple levels including complete cloning of similar devices including for example an operating system OS application environment look and feel GUIs etc. . Alternatively cloning may comprise copying one or more of an OS an OS and applications an OS plus applications and data a specific application and associated data wherein data could be content and or user settings etc.

In operation newer versions of an underlying OS or applications that are available from the source device or that are already installed on the cloned device may trigger a user authorization prompt on either the source or cloned device before overwriting or installation of older versions. Cloning procedures can involve full device to device data exchange support redirection to an original source for download purchase and registration interaction or a combination thereof. By way of example a user might configure a new tablet device by cloning copying a previously docked tablet device including all prior data telephone numbers and other contact information etc. settings media content and libraries and installed applications. Such a procedure may be applied to many types of social devices including smart phones social robots and avatars. Security procedures may be employed as necessary to protect data exchanges involving secure devices. Further fallback or reversion data may be stored locally or in storage associated with a SNET.

In other embodiments a temporary cloning operation may be used. For example a human may own multiple smart phones one of which is primarily used during travel. The owner may decide to lend this phone to a companion or family member who is authorized to temporarily install configuration information and data associated with all or a portion of his her own phone.

In the exemplary cloning operation upon activating or docking a social device account and or device information is automatically or via a setup up prompt provided to the SNET group. Next in step operational control of the social device or certain configurable resources of the social device is conferred to a node of or cloning process supported by the SNET group. This node or process then generates contextually appropriate control and configuration signals as shown in step . Such control signals and related cloning data are communicated to the social device possibly via a standardized communication protocol.

In response to the control signals the social device performs one or more cloning operations either automatically or as authorized by a user in step . Such operations may include for example extending device configuration data for use by at least a portion of the social device the device configuration data associated with a second device affiliated with a SNET group. Further interaction and data exchange with the social device resource may occur in step . In subsequent step control of the social device resource is terminated or relinquished to a user or other SNET node.

In the illustrated embodiment a member or device of a SNET group or alternatively an unaffiliated entity or node of SNET group sub group accesses social group services and resources associated with the SNET group via a configuration and resource management node . The configuration and resource management node of this embodiment comprises access rights access views dynamic re allocation functionality allocation functionality and security functionality .

In operation the access rights and access views control differing access levels and access visibility for social support services device information a member s personal information data services processing and storage capabilities and other social resources. Access rights and access views can be predefined for example based on a SNET group based on co member devices or based on member s own device to device interactions. Such predefinition can be tailored dynamically as needed or as relationships change. Access rights may also be expanded to support temporary interaction with a guest member or visitor device. For example a visiting member with a smart phone may be permitted to receive provide support service affiliated with a home group. 

In some embodiments a member of the SNET group can adjust and modify access rights on an information by information basis device by device basis member by member basis etc. Through access views the member might also present itself in various ways depending on context location or use based considerations. For example a member icon avatar may present differing characteristics or capabilities that are context dependent including work home or social settings. Allocation and as necessary dynamic reallocation of social services resources is performed by dynamic re allocation functionality and allocation functionality . Access to social services resources can be preconditioned on secure access authentication performed by security functionality .

In addition to social group services and resources the SNET group might include for example a SNET server and one or more human or AI personas functions members and affiliated social devices services applications files web pages connections and other social resources. As will be appreciated a human member can establish selective or tiered access to personal information and associated social device profiles and other resources as described above. In certain embodiments the configuration and resource management node may be incorporated in system circuitry of a SNET proxy server or other SNET social device or administered by a SNET hosting infrastructure either in a standalone or distributed manner. Further the SNET server may include a firewall operable to provide secure access and perform basic routing functions.

Access to social group support services and resources by nodes of the SNET group sub group may occur in a variety of ways including via a user interface UI utilized by one or more humans . The UI might comprise a graphical user interface GUI or browser that graphically indicates available support services etc. Access to the SNET group can also be managed by a proxy server . The proxy server functions as an intermediary for access requests from proxy clients including social services and or devices connected to the proxy server via the Internet or other IP based networks seeking to communicate with the SNET group . Social devices affiliated with a SNET group sub group may have the capacity to interact directly with the SNET group . It is noted that the human members proxy server and social devices may operate independently of a SNET group sub group. Further the proxy server may be a distributed or cloud based entity or a member of or incorporated in a member of either the SNET group sub group or SNET group .

The access and allocation management functionality comprises access rights access control functions arbitration and dynamic re allocation and access view control . Exemplary operation of such functions is described in conjunction with various other Figures herein. Servicing of requests for access to social services and resources may be carried out for example via a browser and or downloaded or preinstalled support services . In certain embodiments access to social services and resources is conditioned upon authentication or security operations . In addition various functional blocks of the social device may be incorporated into one or more integrated circuit devices which may be dedicated to support a primary user and or shared access operations.

The social device further includes processing circuitry operable to process and manage communications services and associations between the device and other entities including members of a SNET group sub group third parties software agents etc. More particularly the processing circuitry may include for example a software management application comprising one or more of docking logic including support for device discovery and configuration protocols such as described below communication protocol control service and resource management and security authentication functionality.

The social device further may utilize that may take many forms and be maintained in static or dynamic memory . Such profile information enables a social device and or user to present an image of itself and its capabilities to other members of a SNET. In particular device group profile information and other resources and user profile information may be utilized in various ways in accordance with the disclosure to facilitate a variety of social interactions. Depending on the capabilities and requirements of a particular device and other members of a SNET a device or user profile may be static or dynamic.

In certain embodiments the social device may interact with a user s via user interface circuitry . User input to the social device may include for example data entry through a keypad touchscreen remote control device gaming controller device control buttons voice or gesture commands storage device etc. For example voice or gesture commands may be utilized to trigger intelligent services. Authorized access to or control of the social device can be facilitated through unique biometric identifiers passwords token based identification trusted authorities or documents such as a driver s license or passport and like authentication means.

The social device may perform core or underlying functionality e.g. a social appliance security device vehicular communication node etc. . Alternatively the social device may primarily function as a social networking interface or communication device or be programmable to perform specific functions within a SNET group sub group.
