The exemplary configuration illustrated in is provided for simplicity. It should be understood that user device or user device or network device may include more or fewer devices than illustrated in . In an exemplary implementation user device or user device network device may perform operations in response to processor executing sequences of instructions contained in a computer readable medium such as memory . A computer readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device. The software instructions may be read into memory from another computer readable medium e.g. a hard disk drive HDD SSD etc. or from another device via communication interface . Alternatively hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the implementations described herein. Thus implementations described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

Controls program may include user interface logic access control logic database and communication logic . Controls program and its various logic components are shown in as being included in user device . In alternative implementations these components or a portion of these components may be located externally with respect to user device . For example in some implementations one or more of the components of controls program may be located in or executed by user device or network device .

User interface logic may include logic to provide a user with an interface to enter information associated with controlling access to various programs stored in user device or requesting access to various media via network . For example user interface logic may include a graphical user interface GUI that allows a user to set controls associated with use of applications stored in user device on a per application or per functionality basis such as time restrictions associated with use of an application operational restrictions associated with use of an application or functionality of user device content restrictions associated with media played downloaded by user device etc. This information may be stored in database as described in more detail below. User interface logic may also include logic to display information in response to an attempt to use a program or access outside of the control settings.

In some implementations a party such as a parent may access controls program directly on user device and interface with the GUI provided by user interface logic to set the various criteria for controlling access to programs. In other implementations a parent may access controls program on user device remotely. For example a parent may access controls program remotely over network from another device such as user device . In either case controls program may require a user name and or password in order to set the controls criteria. This will prevent a child from later changing various settings. In some implementations controls program may query other devices such as user device and or network device via for example an application programming interface API to identify controls permission settings associated with various programs stored on user device as described in detail below.

Access control logic may include logic associated with determining whether access to various programs stored on user device is permitted and or determining whether user device may be used to access content via network . For example access control logic may access database to determine whether access to a particular program is to be granted. In other implementations access control logic may query other devices via an API to identify the appropriate access control settings.

Database may store information identifying various programs along with corresponding controls associated with use of the programs. As an example database may store table as illustrated in . Referring to table may include a program field a time restrictions field a content restrictions field and other field .

Program field may identify various applications stored in user device such as an electronic book ebook reader program a text messaging program an email program an Internet browser various games music playing applications etc. Time restrictions field may store information identifying various time restrictions associated with use of the program stored in corresponding program field . For example field in entry indicates that text messaging may be used Monday through Friday from 4 00 PM until 8 00 PM and on Saturday Sunday from 10 00 AM until 10 00 PM. As another example field of entry indicates that games may only be used for two hours per day.

Content restrictions field may store information identifying types of content that are prohibited from being accessed or received by user device . For example content restrictions field for entry may indicate that web sites identified as having adult content may be prohibited from being accessed by user device . Other field may include other criteria restrictions associated with user device . For example other field in entry indicates that all text messages must be proxied through the parent s user device. Other field in entry indicates that no attachments are permitted when using the email program.

Referring back to communication logic may include logic for communicating with other devices in network . For example in one implementation communication logic may transmit messages e.g. via an API when a user would like to request access to a program that is listed in database . In this case communication logic may receive information from another device such as user device and or network device to determine whether the user is entitled to interact with the program of choice. Communication logic may then forward the information to access control logic to allow access control logic to permit deny the use or access.

Communication logic may include logic that allows user device to communicate with other devices in network via network . For example communication logic may allow user device to communicate with user device and network device via network .

Access control setting logic may include logic for interacting with controls program in user device . For example access control logic may allow a user associated with user device to remotely set various criteria or change various criteria in controls program with respect to allowing user device to interact with various programs download media etc. In other implementations user device and user device may operate in a master slave or client server relationship in which user device stores a master side version of controls program that allows user device to set and store criteria associated with use of user device directly on user device . In either case access control setting logic may allow a parent at user device to set controls associated with use of user device .

Database may include one or more databases or information associated with a controlling access to programs or media by user device . For example database may store a table similar to table described above with respect to . In this implementation a parent at user device may access the table to identify and or change criteria associated with controlling use of user device .

In an exemplary implementation communication logic access control setting logic and database may include one or more processors microprocessors or other processing logic such as processor used to interpret and execute instructions. In such implementations the logic components may include software instructions stored in a computer readable medium such as memory . The software instructions may be read into memory from another computer readable medium or from another device via a communication interface. The software instructions contained in memory may cause the various logic components to perform processes that are described below. Alternatively hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the logic processes consistent with the exemplary embodiments. Thus systems and methods described herein are not limited to any specific combinations of hardware circuitry firmware and software.

Communication logic may include logic that allows network device to communicate with other devices in network via network . For example communication logic may allow network device to communicate with user device and or user device via network . In an exemplary implementation user device may communication with network device to set and or augment controls with respect to use of user device as described in detail below.

Provider control logic may include logic for interacting with controls program in user device and user device . For example provider control logic may allow a parent to use network device to control and or augment control of user device . As an example if a parent is not available to provide approval for use of a particular program the parent may indicate that network device is authorized to determine whether to provide access to a particular file media. In some instances provider control logic may be configured to allow access to types of media indicated as being appropriate for children of a certain age. In other implementations provider control logic may be configured to provide access based on previous access granted to user device via user device . In each case a parent at user device may interact with provider control logic to set the particular criteria associated with allowing access to various programs and or forwarding media to user device .

Database may include one or more databases or information associated with a controlling access to media by a large number of user devices such as user device . For example database may store a table of criteria provided by a parent at user device . In this implementation a parent at user device may access the table to identify and or change criteria associated with controlling use of user device . In addition database may be used to store profiles such that an individual s profile or a group profile may be readily applied to a new replacement user device or user device .

In an exemplary implementation communication logic provider control logic and database may include one or more processors microprocessors or other processing logic such as processor used to interpret and execute instructions. In such implementations the logic components may include software instructions stored in a computer readable medium such as memory . The software instructions may be read into memory from another computer readable medium or from another device via a communication interface. The software instructions contained in memory may cause the various logic components to perform processes that are described below. Alternatively hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the logic processes consistent with the exemplary embodiments. Thus systems and methods described herein are not limited to any specific combinations of hardware circuitry firmware and software.

If however the ebook reader application includes restrictions block yes access control logic may identify the restrictions block . For example referring to table program field in entry identifies the ebook reader and field of entry indicates that pleasure reading is prohibited on Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 00 AM and 7 30 PM and that reading of school materials is prohibited between the hours of 11 00 PM and 6 00 AM.

Controls program may then identify the material to be downloaded or accessed block . In this example assume that the user has selected a latest Twilight series book and the current day time is Thursday at 7 00 PM. In this case access control logic may determine whether the selected material is restricted from being read at the current time block . For example access control logic may identify the Twilight book as corresponding to pleasure reading. In one implementation school related materials may be identified based on one or more of identifying metadata or tags included with the material that identifies the material as school related by comparing the requested material to a stored list identifying all school materials identifying a site via which the material will be accessed etc. In this case assume that access control logic identifies the Twilight book as pleasure reading. Access control logic may also identify that field of entry indicates that pleasure reading is prohibited Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 00 AM and 7 30 PM. In this case access control logic may block user device from downloading or accessing the book since the current time i.e. Thursday at 7 00 PM in this example is within the restricted time window block . User interface logic may also provide a pop up message via output device e.g. an LCD screen of user device indicating that pleasure reading is not allowed during the hours of 8 00 AM and 7 30 PM block . User device may be configured to send notification s to user device with details of attempts to access materials outside permitted conditions. Alternatively access violation notifications may be sent to network device and stored in database for future review by the owner operator of user device .

Returning to block assume that the user selected material via the ebook reader that is school related. In this case access control logic may determine that the school materials may be accessed downloaded since the current time i.e. 7 00 PM is not within the restricted window block no . In this case access control logic may allow the user to download access the desired material block .

In some implementations if a child would like to execute an application or access materials outside the allotted time user interface logic may allow the user to transmit a notification such as a text message email automated voice call to user device requesting that the child would like to access the identified materials. The parent at user device may then decide to override the restrictions and grant access to the materials. In this case access control setting logic may send a communication to access control logic signaling access control logic to allow the download access. In this manner the child may be able to ask for permission to perform a particular action e.g. download or purchase a book when controls program initially denies the request.

In some implementations actions performed by user device may be logged at network device . In this case the parent at user device may view recent activity associated with use of user device and decide whether to allow access and or set a time or bandwidth limit associated with the use of an application. In this case access control setting logic may send a communication to access control logic signaling access control logic to allow the download access or permit use of the application.

As described above various applications on user device may be restricted based on criteria defined by a party such as a parent. In addition basic functionality or features of user device may also be limited restricted in a similar fashion. For example texting via user device may be disabled while the child is at school or supposed to be asleep. In an alternative implementation texting may only be permitted to parent or sibling devices during the restricted times. Similarly web sites accessible via user device s browser may be controlled by controls program . Still further in some implementations use of a keypad of mobile device to make phone calls may be disabled during certain hours use of camera and or GPS device may be disabled during certain hours etc.

In other implementation controls program may allow a parent to place user device in a mode in which data traffic and or requests are proxied through the parent s device s e.g. user device . For example other field of entry indicates that text messaging should be proxied through the parent s device.

In this case assume that the party enters the telephone number of user device . Alternatively if the email program is being proxied the party may enter his her email address. User interface logic receives the telephone number of the device that will be used to proxy traffic and or requests from user device . In this implementation user interface logic may also query the parent as to what types of communications and or requests are to be proxied via user device .

For example a parent may like to see both incoming and outgoing text messages for each texting session while the texting session is occurring such as in a passive monitoring mode. In other instances a parent may interact with user interface logic to request that outbound texts requests will be sent to user device before delivery with an option to substitute parent s number for the child s number or to send texts from user device i.e. the child s device only after approval from the parent and that inbound texts are to be sent to the parent s phone i.e. user device in this example for approval before being forwarded to the child s phone i.e. user device . In some implementations proxying texts may be done invisibly from the child s perspective or with an indicator showing the current mode that all texts are being transmitted to from user device . In some instances proxying texts in this manner may increase the use of unlimited text plans by a parent since he she would be aware of all texts being sent. In each case the parent at user device may select the type of proxying and user interface logic may receive the selections block . User interface logic may store the proxying related information in database block .

For example other field of entry in table may indicate that text messaging sessions are to be proxied via the parent s user device. Database e.g. table may also include further information identifying the type of proxying e.g. passive monitoring active approval etc. based on the information provided by the parent.

After the proxying related information is selected by the user and stored by controls program assume that the child at user device launches the text messaging application at user device and enters a text message to send to a friend. Further assume that database stores information indicating that the child s parent must approve all outgoing and incoming texts. In this case communication logic may forward the child s text message to user device block . The parent may then decide whether the text message can be sent block .

For example if the parent decides that the text message does not contain any inappropriate language the parent at user device may determine that the text message can be sent block yes . In this case communication logic at user device may send a communication to user device authorizing user device to transmit the text message. User device receives the approval and communication logic transmits the text message. If however the parent determines that the text is inappropriate the parent at user device may decide to block transmission of the text message block no . In this case communication logic at user device may send a communication to user device indicating that the user device is not to send the text message block . User device may also output a message via output device indicating that the text message has been blocked and will not be sent. Incoming text messages may be similarly sent to user device for approval before being displayed output by user device .

Other types of actions such as requesting downloads purchases etc. may be proxied through the parent s device e.g. user device . In this manner a parent can ensure that his her child is not using user device in a manner not agreed to by the parent.

As another example use of a browser on user device may be controlled or proxied. For example field of entry in table indicates that the Internet browser of user device includes time restrictions and content restrictions. In this example time restrictions field of entry indicates that Internet browsing is prohibited on Monday Friday between the hours of 6 00 AM to 3 00 PM e.g. during school hours . Content restrictions field also indicates that adult content is restricted. In this case access control logic may attempt determine whether content on a web site of interest contains adult related materials based on a name of the website actual content of a webpage of interest etc. If the website is determined to contain adult content access control logic may deny access to the website.

In other instances a child s attempts to use the browser on user device may be proxied via user device . In this case user device may send a message to user device identifying the website of interest for approval by the parent. Still further the communication from user device may include an option for the parent to view or visit the website webpage first. In still other implementations the history of Internet sites accessed by user device may be logged to user device and or network device so that the parent can later look at the sites that were accessed.

In still other alternative implementations a parent may grant access to a particular website at some point in time. However since content that was approved may change over time a parent may interact with user interface logic to indicate that content provided to user device at one point in time must be re approved at a later time. In addition content accessed by user device may be mirrored for a period of time to a logging site such as network device so that the parent can replay the traffic later without impacting the child s wait times.

In addition in some implementations controls program may automatically log use information such as the name of an application being used start suspend resume stop idle times of the application messages sent received by user device etc. to a network based data storage device such as network device . The parent may then later retrieve view the information associated with the child s use of user device . In this manner if the child later claims he she was studying the parent can check network device and determine that the child was playing a game e.g. Angry Birds for a certain number hours in the last two days.

Controls program may also include security to prevent a child from trying to disable networking and tweak time settings. For example if the child at user device attempts to change password protected user settings controls program may go into a lockout mode allowing access to only a very restricted list of applications features.

In the scenarios described above user device controls and or limits access to programs and or media based on user defined e.g. parent defined criteria stored on user device . In some implementations the control criteria may be stored on user device and or user device . In still other implementations the control criteria may be stored at network device .

For example as described above the service provider that provides communication services e.g. phone Internet data etc. to user device or some other entity may store the control criteria at for example network device . In this case database may store information associated with a large number of customers users for which the service provider via network device will control actions performed by the corresponding user devices of the customers based on customer e.g. parent defined criteria. In this case user device may include an API that contacts network device on a per application basis to identify the particular control criteria in a similar manner as that described above.

In addition in some implementations network device may augment criteria defined by a parent and stored in user device . For example assume that controls program is set to require parental approval for all downloads such as books songs applications etc. In this case further assume that a child attempts to download a book and user device sends a notification to user device requesting approval. In this case further assume that the parent receives the request but would like to obtain more information associated with the requested book. The parent at user device may then contact network device to identify reviews ratings associated with the requested book.

For example network device may store rating or reviews of the book by other parents teachers etc. The parent at user device may click on a particular rating and see other ratings provided by that particular reviewer. This may let the parent see if he she has agreed with other ratings reviews provided by that reviewer. The parent may then use the ratings to aid in determining whether to allow the child to download the book.

In other implementations if the child at user device is attempting to download some media such as a song the parent may be unavailable or busy and may not be able to provide his her approval disapproval within a predetermined period of time e.g. 5 minutes 15 minutes etc . In this scenario the parent may have set criteria that the request for approval will be forwarded to network device to determine whether access should be granted. In this case network device may store information indicating that other parents have permitted access to the requested media i.e. song in this example to their children 98 of the time. Network device may be configured to approve the request when other parents have permitted access a threshold percentage of time e.g. 90 . In this case network device may signal user device to permit the download. Network device may also send a communication to user device indicating that user device was provided access to the particular media. The parent at user device may be able to later revoke the permission.

As described above user device may communicate with user device and or network device to control use of user device . In some implementations network device may further aid in controlling or augment control of user device . For example network device may store information identifying all school texts within the jurisdiction e.g. county in which the child and parent associated with user devices and reside. This list of school related materials may allow user device to easily identify school materials that a child should be permitted to access. That is access control logic at user device may access the stored list to determine whether material is school related or pleasure reading.

As described above network device may store information that augments information stored by user devices and . For example network device may store ratings information associated with various media. In still other implementations network device may provide an option to allow a parent to auto search content that is requested for download. As an example the parent at user device may request that network device scan auto search the requested content and provide a score based on key words phrases classifications etc. associated with the content. In one implementation content with no profanity may get a score of 1 while content with profanity vulgar language or anatomical terms may get a score of 5. Content with favorable ratings by reviewers may also get a score of 1. If the cumulative score for the content meets a threshold value network device may automatically provide access to the material. In other instances the parent at user device may still require approval. In this manner a book that describes a violent crime death genocide etc. that is historical in nature but may generate a low cumulative score may still be approved by the parent.

As another example materials provided by a teacher at the child s school can be flagged to ensure that the child can access the material. For example messages email text RSS feeds etc. from the child school teacher s can be flagged based on assignments. In this manner a text with objectionable terms or text otherwise indicated as pleasure reading e.g. Frankenstein may be flagged via for example an RSS feed with the child s English reading assignment. In this case network device may add the educational school tag to the ebook to make it available to the child subject to any time or other restrictions provided in table .

In the manner described above parents or other guardians may control a child s access to programs and functionality of a user device. For example applications and functionality of user device may be limited based on pre defined parent criteria such as time based criteria use based criteria content based criteria or any other criteria provided.

Implementations described herein provide for controlling use of a mobile device or other electronic device. As described above a parent guardian may provide criteria for how a child s mobile device will be used. This may allow the parent to reduce the chances that the child will use the device in an manner not approved by the parent or access inappropriate material.
