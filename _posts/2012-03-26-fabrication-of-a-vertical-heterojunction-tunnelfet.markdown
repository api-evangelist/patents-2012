This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 815 902 filed Jun. 15 2010 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. FA8650 08 C 7806 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to semiconductor fabrication and more specifically to systems and methods for fabricating a vertical heterojunction tunnel field effect transistor FET implementing a planar process.

Tunnel FETs are proposed as a replacement for complement to existing CMOS technology. Tunnel FET structures with a heterojunction on the source side of the device are preferred since they can increase device performance while suppressing parasitic ambipolar behavior at the drain end. Existing tunnel FET designs predominantly use a tunnel junction perpendicular to the gate rather than parallel which reduces the effectiveness of the gate field. Other designs which use a gate parallel tunnel path either do not have a heterojunction or have one which also exists on the drain side increasing parasitic ambipolar current.

Exemplary embodiments include a method for fabricating a heterojunction tunnel field effect transistor FET the method including forming a gate region on a silicon layer of a silicon on insulator SOI substrate forming a drain region on the silicon layer adjacent the gate region and forming a vertical heterojunction source region adjacent the gate region wherein the vertical heterojunction source region generates a tunnel path inline with a gate field associated with the gate region.

Additional embodiments include a method for fabricating a heterojunction tunnel field effect transistor FET the method including forming a gate region on a silicon layer of a silicon on insulator SOI substrate forming an n type drain region on the silicon layer adjacent the gate region and forming a vertical heterojunction source region adjacent the gate region wherein the vertical heterojunction source region includes a p type source region layer disposed between a first n type semiconductor layer and a second n type semiconductor layer.

Additional embodiments include a field effect transistor FET device including a silicon on insulator SOI substrate a gate region disposed on the SOI substrate a drain region adjacent the gate region and a vertical heterojunction source region adjacent the gate region wherein the vertical heterojunction source region generates a tunnel path inline with a gate field associated with the gate region.

Further exemplary embodiments include a field effect transistor FET device including a silicon on insulator SOI substrate including a silicon substrate layer a buried oxide layer disposed on the silicon substrate layer and a silicon layer disposed on the buried oxide layer wherein a portion of the silicon layer is n type and disposed in a vertical heterojunction source region an oxide layer disposed on the silicon layer a gate disposed on the oxide layer and encapsulated in spacers and a hardmask an n type drain region adjacent the gate region a p type source region partially disposed underneath the portion of the n type silicon layer and an n type silicon layer disposed underneath the p type source region wherein the vertical heterojunction source region generates a tunnel path inline with a gate field associated with the gate region.

Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features refer to the description and to the drawings.

Exemplary embodiments include an apparatus and method for fabricating a heterojunction tunnel FET with the tunnel path in line with the gate fabricated in a planar process which gives a gate parallel tunnel path with a source side only heterojunction. The exemplary embodiments described herein include tunnel FETs as a replacement for complement to MOSFETs. In exemplary embodiments a heterojunction at the source allows a low effective band gap at the source injection point while maintaining a high band gap at the drain side which suppresses parasitic ambipolar behavior. Exemplary embodiments further include tunneling paths in line with the gate field.

The device can further include a source region which can be a P SiGe source. In exemplary embodiments the source region is a portion of a heterojunction source including the source region a semiconductor region of a differing semiconductor material than the source region and a semiconductor region of a differing semiconductor material than the source region. In exemplary embodiments the semiconductor regions are similar semiconducting materials as further described herein. Similarly the semiconductor regions may be the same semiconducting materials at the drain region . In the example of . the source region is P SiGe and the semiconductor regions as well as the drain region are N Si. As described herein the vertical heterojunction including the source region sandwiched between the semiconductor regions generates a low effective band gap at the source injection point while maintaining a high band gap at the drain region thereby suppressing parasitic ambipolar behavior. In addition the vertical heterojunction generates a tunnel path inline with a gate field which is a desirable quality over tunneling paths that occur at an angle as in the prior art as further discussed herein. In exemplary embodiments the device further includes a gate disposed on an insulating layer e.g. an oxide layer . In exemplary embodiments the gate can include spacers and a hardmask . As known in the art the spacers and hardmask can be implemented to pattern the gate during fabrication of the device and can be any suitable material including but not limited to silicon nitride. In another example the gate spacers may have a multilayer structure and may include silicon oxide silicon nitride silicon oxynitride or other dielectric material. In exemplary embodiments the spacers and the hardmask of the gate are formed to protect the gate during manufacturing processing. The encapsulation can avoid oxidation of gate and also facilitate repairing or restoring stoichiometry of the gate that may be damaged or altered during gate patterning.

As discussed above the vertical heterojunction generates a tunnel path inline with a gate field. illustrates a conventional corner device in which a tunnel path is generated from the source to the gate at an angle with respect to the gate . illustrates an Id Vg plot comparing the exemplary device and the conventional device thereby illustrating advantages of having the tunnel path inline with the gate filed as opposed to a tunnel path at an angle with respect to the gate . As plotted for the exemplary device as the gate voltage Vg is increased the drain current Id is higher by as much as 100 times that of a given gate voltage for the conventional device . illustrates a plot of subthreshold slope STS versus drain current for both the exemplary device and the conventional device. As illustrated for a given STS the exemplary device has as much as a 10 000 times increase in drain current.

Exemplary methods for fabricating the device are now discussed. illustrates a flow chart for a method for fabricating a vertical heterojunction tunnel FET in accordance with exemplary embodiments. In exemplary embodiments those skilled in the art will appreciate that the exemplary FETs described herein can be fabricated with standard CMOS processes. illustrate resulting intermediate structures during each of the fabrication steps described herein.

At block standard masking and lithography techniques are implemented to mask the intermediate structure of to pattern the region to form the vertical heterojunction and protect the gate spacers hardmask and drain region . In exemplary embodiments the hardmask is patterned as well. In exemplary embodiments the hardmask can be patterned implementing standard masking and lithography techniques as well as anisotropic etching techniques such as reactive ion etching RIE to remove the hardmask from the side of the intermediate structure in which the source is to be fabricated. As further described herein the hardmask protects the drain region from subsequent growth steps. illustrates an intermediate structure in which a region for the vertical heterojunction has been patterned and formed. In exemplary embodiments the region is formed by etching through the buried oxide layer and the silicon layer with fabrication techniques known in the art. For example the buried oxide layer and the silicon layer can be etched with an etching technique suitable for etching the two materials such as an anisotropic etch e.g. RIE .

At block a source side heterojunction region undercut etch is performed. The masking implemented at block can be maintained to protect the gate spacers hardmask and drain region . Alternatively additional standard masking and lithography techniques can be implemented to mask the intermediate structure of to pattern the region to form the undercut etch. illustrates an intermediate structure in which an undercut region for the source region has been patterned and formed. In exemplary embodiments the region is formed by etching through the buried oxide layer between the silicon substrate and the silicon layer by fabrication techniques known in the art. As such an etchant capable of etching SiOand not Si is desirable. For example the buried oxide layer can be etched a buffered oxide etch BHF with warm hydrofluoric acid.

At block a region for the vertical heterojunction is doped with a suitable dopant for forming the desirable tunnel path . As such since the drain region is doped n type in the example the source region is p type in a later fabrication step. To form the tunnel path the region for the vertical heterojunction is doped the same as the drain region in this case n type. The masking implemented at blocks and can be maintained to protect the gate spacers hardmask and drain region from being doped. Additional masking and lithography techniques can be implemented to mask the buried oxide layer in the undercut region from being doped. illustrates an intermediate structure in which the region for the vertical heterojunction has been doped. In exemplary embodiments the semiconductor regions can be formed doping the semiconductor regions with fabrication techniques known in the art. For example the semiconductor regions can be gas phase doped with an n type dopant species with an elements including but not limited to phosphorous arsenic and antimony. The gas phase doping can be carried out to attain the desired doping levels of the semiconductor regions . As such the resulting N Si the semiconductor regions are formed. In other exemplary embodiments other doping methods such as atomic layer deposition of a dopant containing species or the epitaxial growth of a thin layer of highly doped Si and subsequent out diffusion of the dopant species can be implemented.

At block the source region is formed. As described since the drain region and the semiconductor regions are doped n type in the example the source region is p type. In exemplary embodiments the source region can be formed by implementing a chemical vapor deposition CVD based epitaxial technique. Furthermore the material grown by the CVD based epitaxial technique such as silicon germanium SiGe can be in situ doped with a p type dopant. In addition the growth can be selective in that the material only grows on Si. As such in situ born doped ISBD SiGe can be grown as the source region . It is appreciated that any other type of p type dopant can be implemented such as an element for Group IIA including but not limited to aluminum gallium and indium. The masking implemented at blocks and can be maintained to protect the gate spacers hardmask and drain region from being deposited. As described herein the hardmask remains in place to prevent SiGe from growing on the drain region . In exemplary embodiments depending on the orientation of the initial silicon wafer used in the SOI base it is desirable to grow the source region with the same orientation. For example for wafers MBE growth at the source region is from a preferred plane. illustrates an intermediate structure in which ISBD SiGe has been grown as the source region thereby forming the P source region as described in . The hardmask can subsequently be removed. Standard CMOS fabrication techniques known in the art can be implemented to complete the desired structure. As described with respect to the desirable vertical heterojunction with a tunnel path inline with a gate field is now formed.

Technical effects include a heterojunction at the source that allows a low effective band gap at the source injection point while maintaining a high band gap at the drain side which suppresses parasitic ambipolar behavior.
