Some types of online services rely on receiving various data from users such as if the services provide user specific data analysis or other user specific functionality based on the received data. However for many users it is difficult to effectively supply the data of interest to the online services particularly if the data to be supplied is received incrementally over time or otherwise changes frequently.

Techniques are described for using electronic communications to enable users to supply data to an online service for later access or use in one or more manners. The electronic communications may be used to upload or otherwise supply data to an online service in various manners including in particular embodiments based on one or more of the body contents of an electronic communication on file attachments of an electronic communication on header fields or other metadata included with the electronic communication on externally stored documents or other external storage locations that are referenced by the electronic communication etc. The electronic communications may be email communications in some embodiments while in other embodiments other types of electronic communications may be used. In additions in some embodiments and situations users may configure various types of data manipulation operations that an online service is to perform on data received via such electronic communications. After data for a user has been supplied to an online service and optionally manipulated by the online service in one or more configured manners that user or other users to whom that user provides access may retrieve or otherwise access that data from the online service in various manners including by using one or more data retrieval access interfaces that are distinct from the electronic communications used to supply the data to the online service.

The described techniques may be used in a variety of types of environments and situations including with a variety of types of online services. As one illustrative example the described techniques may be used with an online user data search service that provides user specific data manipulation and searching capabilities to users of the service such as in exchange for fees paid by the users. For example when such a user registers with such a user data search service the user data search service may provide the user with one or more email addresses or other electronic communication addresses managed by the user data search service so that the user may send emails or other electronic communications to the provided electronic communication address es that include user specific data to be supplied to the user data search service for later use on behalf of that user. The user data search service may also provide the user with one or more data retrieval interfaces that are separate from the provided electronic communication address es such as one or more programmatic search interfaces e.g. via an API or application programming interface of the user data search service that may be accessed by an executing software program of a user to request and receive portions of the user specific data that satisfy any specified search criteria and or one or more interactive search interfaces via which the user may manually browse or search the user specific data.

A user of the user data search service may also optionally configure particular data analysis operations or other data manipulation operations that the user data search service is to perform on supplied user specific data such as to perform different types of data manipulation for electronic communications received using different electronic communication addresses provided to the user and or based on instructions supplied in a particular electronic communication e.g. using a header field of the communication using a tag or other specified parameter in the body of the communication etc. that specify one or more types of data manipulation operations to be performed for the data supplied by that particular electronic communication. In other embodiments and situations the user data search service may perform predefined types of data manipulation operations on specified types of supplied data such as to provide default data manipulation operations that are used unless a particular user configures other types of behavior.

After the user data search service has provided the electronic communication address es to a particular user the service may receive various types of user specific data supplied by or on behalf of that user optionally analyze or otherwise manipulate that received data in various manners and then provide later access to that user specific data to that particular user or other users to whom that particular user provides access . In addition to facilitate the later retrieval of the user specific data the user data search service may in some situations generate one or more search indexes based on the user specific data. Subsequently the user data search service receives data access requests that are each associated with one of the users of the service and provides access to that user s data as appropriate such as based on any access related configuration specified by that user and by using any search indexes generated for that user s data. In such embodiments some or all of the described techniques may be provided by automated operations of the user data search service.

The illustrative environment also includes one or more server computing systems that are configured to perform some or all of the described techniques with the server computing systems providing a user data search service is this example embodiment. In addition the illustrative environment may optionally include one or more other network accessible computing systems that store various content which may be accessed and used by the user data search service in various manners. The server computing system s are illustrated in this example as including one or more processors e.g. CPUs that may be connected to a communication interface memory and storage . The memory in this example includes a configuration module an electronic communication data intake module and a data retrieval interface module with each module including executable software instructions to configure the server computing system s to perform associated functionality when executed by the processor s in order to provide some or all of the described techniques. The storage in this example includes user configuration data for various users of the user data search service user searchable data that has been received for various users of the user data search service and optionally user search indexes that have been generated for some or all of the user searchable data . Additional details are included below regarding operation of the modules and to provide the described techniques and use of the user configuration data user searchable data and user search indexes .

In particular in the examples of a user of the user data search service is affiliated with an online retailer that uses a Web site to perform various transactions and other interactions with customers. The retailer affiliated user also referred to below as the retailer user registers with the user data search service and configures various types of search related capabilities to be provided by the user data search service which enable the retailer user to provide various types of functionality to customers of the Web site and to receive functionality related to operation of the retailer s business.

In particular involves an electronic communication being sent to the user data search service at a time after the user has registered with the user data search service and has configured various types of capabilities to be provided by the user data search service. In the example of an email communication is illustrated that the user has sent to the user data search service using a first electronic communication address provided by the user data search service in order to supply data to the user data search service in a manner that will initiate a first type of search related capabilities provided by the user data search service. The user in this example is sending the email from an email account associated with the example retailer referred to in this example as retailerABC with an example username of AdministratorZZZ for the retailer user as indicated in header information of the received email. In this example the first electronic communication address provided by the user data search service is an email address retailerABC products .com that is indicated in the To header field of the received email with the .com representing a domain name controlled by the user data search service in this example.

In this example the first type of search related capability configured by the user is to allow customers of the retailer s Web site to perform searches for product inventory that is currently available from the retailer. In order to enable such searching capabilities the user provides intake data to the user data search service that identifies product information for a product catalog available from the retailer such as by providing an attached file to the email . In the illustrated example the attached file is indicated in header information of the received email communication and a view is illustrated of some of the contents of the attached file for reference purposes although the information is not part of the body of the email communication which is blank or empty in this example . The user retailer may supply such product catalog data to the user data search service at various times and in various manners such as to periodically send new data that indicates a current catalog of the retailer e.g. to replace any previously sent catalog data such as to enable the retailer to update inventory as new products become available and previously available products become unavailable . In other embodiments and situations the user retailer may instead send updated catalog data to the user data search service that is intended to modify existing catalog data such as to supplement existing stored data by adding new product information and or by removing existing product information that is no longer accurate.

In the illustrated example the attached file includes various rows and columns such as may correspond to a spreadsheet program a table within a word processing program etc. although in other embodiments the data may be represented in other manners e.g. using tags such as for data specified using an XML or eXtensible Markup Language format . In this example each row of the attached file corresponds to a product and each column indicates various types of information for the product such as to include a product name in column a unique identifier for the product in column category information for the product in column etc. It will be appreciated that a variety of other types of information may be included and represented in other manners in other embodiments.

As previously noted the data supplied in the email communication has been configured by the user to initiate a first type of search related capability from the user data search service whether based on the user accepting a default search related capability provided by the user data search service or instead based on the user specifying custom search related capability. The first type of search related capability is triggered in this example based at least in part on configuration instructions supplied as part of the email communication optionally in association with the use of the first provided email address that is used. In particular the subject field header information for the email communication includes keywords in this example that the user specifies to correspond to a particular search related operation to be performed which in this example is Catalog Replace to indicate to replace the existing product catalog of the retailer with new catalog information included in the email communication . In other embodiments the user and or the user data search service may instead not use such operation information in the header of the electronic communication e.g. if different provided electronic communication addresses are used for different types of operations or may instead specify such operation related instructions in other manners e.g. by using other specialized header fields of the communication that include information specific to the user data search service UDSS such as example header field whose contents are empty in this example by including parameters or other instruction related information in the body of the email communication not shown in this example etc. .

Thus after the user data search service receives the email communication from the user the user data search service analyzes the included data in the attached file in accordance with the configuration information specified by the user and stores the data for later use on behalf of the user. For example the user may also have previously specified configuration information related to the structure of the attached file and how to analyze that information while in other embodiments the user data search service may provide default capabilities for data stored in such a row column format such as to treat each row as corresponding to a unique item and to treat each column as an attribute or field for the corresponding items. The analysis of the included data in the attached file by the user data search service may include for example indexing the product catalog data with respect to one or more fields e.g. product name product ID etc. and storing corresponding generated search indexes for later use or otherwise grouping the product catalog data in one or more manners e.g. based on product category .

In this example the Web page is configured to upon selection of the Go button by a customer make a programmatic request to the user data search service to access stored user catalog data for the retailer user such as by invoking an API of the user data search service and providing the specified search terms product category and optionally information specific to the retailer user e.g. a unique identifier that is associated with the user by the user data search service user credential information etc. . In other embodiments the user data search service may instead provide a distinct API for each registered user and if so user specific information may not be provided as part of a programmatic interaction with the user data search service. While not illustrated here it will be appreciated that in some embodiments a user of the user data search service may access stored data in multiple manners such as to have a programmatic interface such as that illustrated with respect to and also have a separate interactive interface via which the user may access stored information. For example the retailer user may be enabled to log in to an account of the user with the user data search service and manually inspect browse or otherwise access stored user data related to the product catalog of the user including to optionally make modifications in at least some embodiments.

When results to the programmatic request are received in this example the Web page is updated to include the search results information whether by modifying the Web page from which the Go button was selected or by generating and displayed a new Web page. In this example it will be appreciated that the search results that are shown in correspond to information that was previously supplied to the user data search service in electronic communication of with the first item ItemXYZ in the search results being shown in row of with the second search results item in corresponding to row of etc.

Thus in the examples described with respect to and the retailer user provides product catalog data to the user data search service via one or more electronic communications and others may later access the stored user data by performing searches using a separate search interface provided by the user data search service.

Electronic communications may be sent to the user data search service by or on behalf of the user registered with the user data search service at various times and in various manners. For example as previously discussed with respect to the user may manually initiate the sending of at least some such electronic communications in particular situations. illustrates an example of one manner in which the user may manually specify and send such an electronic communication such as by using a client device to manually enter the electronic communication to be sent. In other situations at least some such electronic communications may instead be sent based on automated operations of computing systems under control of the user as discussed in greater detail with respect to . In yet other situations electronic communications may be sent on behalf of the user by other computing systems that are not under control of the user such as for a third party system to provide information to the user using an electronic communication address provided by the user. In the example of the client device is a handheld device in which the user represented by hand manually enters an email as shown on the display of the device using a keyboard whether with physical keys or on screen virtual keys and in which the user manually specifies to send the email using displayed control . In some embodiments the display may be touch sensitive such as to allow direct user selection of the displayed control and in other embodiments the user may use one or more hardware controls to select the control and perform other interactions with the device . In other such embodiments the user may use other types of client devices and manually specify and send electronic communications in other manners as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In the illustrated example the retailer user has further configured the search related capabilities of the user data search service to provide a second type of searching capability and in particular to enable the retailer user to manage inventory information for the products that are available via the retailer. Thus the retailer user first supplies intake data to the user data search service that includes inventory information for the products of the retailer such as via a quantity column not shown in the attached file in or instead by supplying one or more other electronic communications that include inventory data for the retailer. The retailer user may then further configure one or more transaction related portions of the retailer s Web site to send electronic communications to the user data search service to update inventory information for the retailer in accordance with transactions that occur. For example in the illustrated example the Buy Immediately control may be configured to upon selection by the customer to whom the Web page is displayed initiate various operations of the retailer to fulfill an order from the current customer for the indicated quantity of the current product and may also be configured to initiate an electronic communication to the user data search service to update inventory of the retailer to indicate that the current indicated quantity of the product is no longer available. illustrates an example communication that may be generated by customer selection of control from the Web page of or alternatively from other portions of the Web site e.g. from a shopping cart portion of the Web site such as after the customer completes a checkout process via the shopping cart .

In the illustrated example of the email communication has similarities to the email communication previously illustrated with respect to but includes additional information as well. In this example the body contents of the email communication include information that identifies a particular product being ordered and information that indicates a quantity of the item that is ordered such as by using tags in this example to identify product and quantity information. As previously discussed with respect to such data may be specified in other manners in other embodiments such as by using XML format using header information or information in the subject line etc. In this example the retailer user has previously configured the second search related capability of the user data search service to receive such emails and to update stored user inventory data for the retailer user in a corresponding manner. In addition in this example the sending user for the email communication is indicated in header information to be the same sending retailer user as in and the destination electronic communication address used in information is similarly the same as was used in . However in the illustrated example the subject line information in header field includes alternative information with respect to that illustrated in and in particular indicates in the example of to provide an inventory update by using configuration instruction keywords Inventory Update . Thus when the user data search service receives the electronic communication the service updates the inventory information for the retailer user in the configured manner which in this example includes decrementing the quantity of available copies of the ItemXYZ product by the indicated quantity of one. While the example email communication of was initiated in this example based on automated operations of a server computing system providing the Web page to customer device such an email communication may be generated and sent in other manners in other embodiments including in a manual manner by the administrator user e.g. in a manner similar to that previously discussed with respect to .

While the first and second configured search related capabilities are distinctly initiated in the examples of and based in part on the corresponding instruction operation information in the subject line of the respective emails it will be appreciated that in other embodiments such distinct searching capabilities may be accessed in other manners including by using two distinct electronic communication addresses. Thus the user data search service may instead use for example a first provided email address of retailerABC catalog .com to receive catalog related emails such as email of and a second provided email address of retailerABC inventory .com to receive inventory related emails such as email of . The username for each of the one or more provided email addresses may in some embodiments be specified by the user as part of the initial configuration activities with the user data search service or in other embodiments may be generated by the user data search service.

Returning to the example of the illustrated Web page also includes additional information about customer reviews that have been received from other customers of the retailer corresponding to the particular ItemXYZ product discussed in Web page . In addition the Web page includes a user selectable control to enable the current customer to create his or her own review for the product and user selectable controls to enable the current customer to search other customer reviews. In the illustrated example the functionality corresponding to controls and may each be configured to access additional distinct types of search related capabilities for the retailer user from the user data search service. For example with respect to the control that enables the current customer to create his or her own review in the illustrated example the selection of the control by the current customer initiates the creation of an email communication from that customer to the user data search service to include that customer s review information with an example of such an email communication being illustrated with respect to . For example the selection of the control may cause an email program on the customer s device to begin to execute if not already executing and to open a new email window with which the customer may then interact to add contents and send the email.

In particular in the example of an electronic communication being sent to the user data search service is illustrated in a manner similar to that previously discussed with respect to email communications and of respectively. In this example the header Subject field information corresponds to the customer s review title and the contents and of the email communication body include additional information for the review although in other embodiments only one of the types of information and may be used. In particular in this example the information is free form text entered by the customer and the information corresponds to a star rating for the product e.g. on a scale of 1 star to 5 star with 5 star being the best .

In this example the customer review information is being sent to a distinct electronic communication address provided by the user data search service to the retailer user as illustrated in the header To field information of the email communication which in this example is retailerABC reviews .com . However it will be appreciated that in other embodiments the same destination email address may instead be used such as with different configuration operation information being indicated e.g. such as via instruction tags in the subject line in the manner illustrated with respect to . In addition in this example the sending user information in header From field information of the example communication corresponds to an email account of the current customer such as if the selection of the control in initiates operation of an email sending program on the customer s device e.g. with the header information being supplied by the Web site of the retailer . In other embodiments the email communication may instead be created and sent by the browser program such as based on the Web site of the retailer providing a corresponding Web form to the customer after selection of the control of e.g. having user editable fields in which the customer specifies one or more of the illustrated information types such as the review title the review text and the review rating .

In the illustrated embodiment after the user data search service receives the email communication the contents of the review are stored by the user data search service along with other customer supplied reviews and an index is optionally generated with respect to all of the customer supplied reviews. The stored data may then be used to satisfy later searching of customer reviews by customers such as with respect to controls of including to use the search index if generated to expedite the identification of relevant search results. Thus for this type of data the user data search service may be configured to store and later provide access to the data without performing analysis or manipulation of the data other than possibly generating a search index or otherwise organizing the data to facilitate later retrieval . In addition any index generated in this example may be stored distinctly from an index created for the product catalog information supplied in and the two types of product catalog data and customer review data may further in some embodiments be stored separately from each other by the user data search service while in other embodiments such data may be stored together but with the distinct search indexes being maintained.

While not illustrated in in other situations the information sent in one or more email communications to the user data search service may allow the use of hyperlinks or other references in the contents of the electronic communication with such an included reference indicating distinct content stored elsewhere e.g. corresponding to a particular resource available on the Internet or other network corresponding to a storage repository that may include multiple types of stored data such as may be provided by an online data storage service accessible to the user etc. . If so in at least some embodiments and optionally as controlled by configuration information specified by the retailer user the user data search service may further allow such links and other references to be included in such incoming electronic communications and subsequently analyze the data for such an electronic communication by using each link or other reference to retrieve the corresponding data to which the link or reference corresponds and then manipulating that retrieved data in a manner similar to that of other data contents of incoming electronic communications. For example in the context of the customer review illustrated in email communication of the customer may supply a link to indicate a corresponding alternative product that the customer is comparing to the current product and the user data search service may retrieve information corresponding to the other product to include as part of the customer review or to otherwise associate with the customer review e.g. to include the name and or unique identifier of the alternative product as a searchable tag for the current customer review even if the contents retrieved from the link are not illustrated as part of this customer review .

Thus the use of the described techniques provides a variety of benefits in various embodiments. For example users of a user data search service or other online service may supply data to the online service in a straightforward manner that is easy to use by sending electronic communications to one or more electronic communication addresses provided by the online service with the electronic communications including user specific data in the electronic communications e.g. in the communication body and or attachments or otherwise referencing external user specific data. Furthermore a variety of types of capabilities may be provided by such an online service with respect to the supplied data for a user with the supplied data optionally being analyzed or otherwise manipulated in one or more manners including in at least some embodiments to perform such data manipulation for a user in a manner that is configured by the user. The data supplied for a user may further be later retrieved by the user or by others authorized by the user in various manners including via a programmatic interface made available by the online service.

As described above various types of search related capabilities may be configured by and provided to the user by embodiments of a user data search service. In addition related types of capabilities may be provided by other types of online services in an analogous manner such as for example an online data storage service e.g. for specialized types of data such as for music or image or video data for any type of data such as data being analyzed or used or generated as part of ongoing execution of one or more software programs etc. an online service that stores business related data and provides corresponding services e.g. an online customer relationship management service an online employee relationship management service etc. an online social networking service etc.

Returning to the illustrated environment of additional details are included regarding operation of the modules and to provide the described techniques and use of the user configuration data user searchable data and user search indexes such as in conjunction with the examples of .

In particular the configuration module of operates as part of an online service being provided by the computing systems and enables users of the online service to register for and configure various types of capabilities to be provided by the online service based on user data supplied to the online service via electronic communications. For example if the online service is a user data search service as illustrated in the configuration module enables a user to configure various types of search related capabilities to be provided by the user data search service including to receive one or more electronic communication addresses to be used to supply user data to the user data search service and to receive information about one of more separate search interfaces that may be used to perform search requests to later access the supplied user data.

Thus for example with respect to the examples of the retailer user may interact with the configuration module to obtain the email addresses used for the email communications and and to configure the types of search related capabilities described for the retailer user to specify current product catalog data to perform automatic transaction related updates to product inventory data and for customers to specify customer review data. In addition the retailer user may interact with the configuration module to obtain information about the one or more separate search interfaces to access stored user data such as for customer searches of product catalog data for customer searches of customer review data and to enable the retailer user to access and optionally modify various product related data e.g. via an interactive interface via which the retailer user manually interacts with the user data search service . Additional details with respect to operation of the configuration module are discussed with respect to .

In addition the electronic communication data intake module of also operates as part of the online service being provided by the computing systems and enables users of the online service to supply user data to the online service using one or more electronic communication addresses provided to the user by the online service. For example if the online service is a user data search service as illustrated in the data intake module enables a user to supply various types of data to the user data search service for later searching such as by using one or more electronic communication addresses provided to the user by the user data search service.

Thus for example with respect to the examples of the retailer user may perform or configure interactions with the data intake module that involve sending the email communications and such as to supply current product catalog data e.g. as illustrated in such as based on manual operations of the retailer user to supply updates to product inventory data e.g. as illustrated in with respect to customer selected purchase control and to supply customer review data e.g. as illustrated in with respect to customer selected review creation control . Additional details with respect to operation of the data intake module are discussed with respect to .

In addition the data retrieval interface module of also operates as part of the online service being provided by the computing systems and enables users of the online service to retrieve or otherwise access information based on user data previously supplied to the online service such as by using one or more data retrieval interfaces made available to the user by the online service. For example if the online service is a user data search service as illustrated in the data retrieval interface module enables a user to send search requests to the user data search service and to receive corresponding portions of the supplied user data that satisfy any criteria of the search requests.

Thus for example with respect to the examples of the retailer user may perform or configure interactions with the data retrieval interface module that involve retrieving product catalog data e.g. as illustrated in with respect to customer selected product search controls and retrieving customer review data e.g. as illustrated in with respect to customer selected review search controls . Additional details with respect to operation of the data retrieval interface module are discussed with respect to .

In addition the user devices are each illustrated as having various data files an operating system and one or more applications that include a Web application e.g. a browser program and an electronic communication application e.g. an email program a chat program a texting program etc. . In some embodiments and situations particular user devices may include additional hardware components e.g. a non volatile storage device such as to store some or all of the data files and software and one or more computer readable medium interfaces etc. and or lack some of the illustrated hardware components. Similarly particular user devices may include additional software components and or lack some of the illustrated software components.

The network of may be any appropriate type of network including an intranet the Internet a cellular network a public switched telephone network a local area network or any other such network or combination thereof. Protocols and components for communicating via such a network are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Communication over the network can be enabled by wired or wireless connections and combinations thereof. In this example the network includes the Internet and the environment includes one or more network accessible computing systems that provide various content . In some embodiments at least some of the electronic communications sent to the user data search computing systems may also be automatically sent by one or more of the computing systems such as for computing systems that are configured to provide functionality for and or information to a particular user registered with the user data search service. In some situations an electronic communication sent to the user data search service by a user may include a link or other reference to particular content stored on a particular computing system or other network accessible storage device and if so the user data search service may retrieve that referenced content and include it with other user supplied data for later searching or other user access.

It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from appropriate data storage. As used herein the term data storage refers to any device or combination of devices capable of non volatile storage access and retrieval of data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. In addition the term memory may refer to various types of memory including volatile memory such as one or more types of RAM random access memory e.g. DRAM or dynamic RAM SRAM or static RAM etc. . The computing systems may include additional hardware components that are not illustrated e.g. various I O interfaces various computer readable medium interfaces etc. including those discussed with respect to user devices and the computing systems may include hardware components similar to those of computing systems . Each computing system and device may include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that system device and may include a computer readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a processor of the system device allow the system device to perform its intended functions. It will also be appreciated that while various items are discussed or illustrated as being stored in volatile memory or on non volatile storage while being used these items or portions of them can be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity.

The environment in one embodiment is a distributed computing environment utilizing several computer systems and components that are interconnected via communication links using one or more computer networks or direct connections. However it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that such a system could operate equally well in a system having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus the depiction of the system in should be taken as being illustrative in nature and not limited to the scope of the disclosure. For example a user data search service or other online service may instead be executed by multiple interacting computing systems or devices and or may include more or less modules than are illustrated whether to include more or less types of functionality than are described or to distribute the described types of functionality in other manners . In addition the functionality of the described techniques may in some embodiments be integrated as part of one or more online services in the manner described while in other embodiments may be provided by a separate system that interacts with one or more affiliated user data search services or other affiliated online services to provide the described techniques to those affiliated online services.

Thus in some embodiments some or all of the described techniques may be performed by hardware means that include one or more processors and or memory and or storage when configured by one or more software programs e.g. a system to provide the user data search service and or data structures such as by execution of software instructions of the one or more software programs and or by storage of such software instructions and or data structures. Furthermore in some embodiments some or all of the described techniques of the indicated systems and or modules may be implemented or provided in other manners such as at least partially using firmware and or hardware means including but not limited to one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs standard integrated circuits controllers e.g. by executing appropriate instructions and including microcontrollers and or embedded controllers field programmable gate arrays FPGAs complex programmable logic devices CPLDs etc. Some or all of the systems modules and or data structures may also be stored e.g. as software instructions or structured data on one or more non transitory computer readable storage mediums such as a hard disk or flash drive or other non volatile storage device volatile or non volatile memory e.g. RAM or flash RAM a network storage device or a portable media article e.g. a DVD disk a CD disk an optical disk a flash memory device etc. to be read by an appropriate drive or via an appropriate connection. The systems modules and data structures may also in some embodiments be transmitted via generated data signals e.g. as part of a carrier wave or other analog or digital propagated signal on a variety of computer readable transmission mediums including wireless based and wired cable based mediums and may take a variety of forms e.g. as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames . Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

As noted a user of a user data search service or other online service may be provided with access to user specific data supplied to the online service in various manners in various embodiments. For example the online service may provide one or more programmatically accessible search interfaces or other data retrieval interfaces such as interfaces that may be programmatically accessed by an executing program of the user or of others on behalf of the user e.g. by customers of a Web site provided by a retailer user . Such programmatically accessible interfaces may for example be part of an API of the online service and may be accessible in various manners including one or more of the following non exclusive list using XML over HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol such as part of the REpresentational State Transfer REST 0 distributed interaction model that focuses on resources using a Web services invocation such as based on one or more of SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol for standard message exchange WSDL Web Services Description Language for description of service invocations and UDDI Universal Description Discovery and Integration service for discovery of available services using remote procedure call RPC protocols etc. In addition the online service may also optionally provide one or more interactive interfaces via which the user may manually browse or search the user specific data supplied for the user such as based on the user using a Web browser or other client side application program to access a GUI graphical user interface provided by the online service via which the user may interactively perform actions to review and optionally modify the user specific data. For example if the online service creates an account for each registered user the interactive interface may include the user accessing his her account.

In addition a user may perform various types of interactions with the online service to specify configuration information such as may be associated with the user s account if any with the online service. Such configuration related interactions may include for example the user using a Web browser or other client side application program to access a GUI provided by the online service via which the user may perform one or more of the following non exclusive list specifying or receiving information about a selection by the online service of one or more electronic communication addresses to be provided by the online service such as by specifying a distinct username or other portion of some or all such provided electronic communication addresses specifying or receiving information about a selection by the online service of one or more types of user specific information e.g. a unique account name or user identifier such as for use in identifying the user and the user s account if provided when later accessing the online service e.g. via a programmatic interface provided by the online service specifying or receiving information about predefined selections by the online service of one or more types of data manipulation operations to be performed on some or all user specific supplied data received in some or all electronic communications such as to be associated with a particular electronic communication address and or operation instruction included in an electronic communication specifying or receiving information about predefined selections by the online service of of how the supplied data e.g. of a particular data collection is later accessible such as by only the user by specified other designated entity by anyone by someone acting under direction of the user or otherwise on behalf of the user e.g. a customer of a Web site provided by a retailer user etc. specifying whether and or how to generate search indexes for the supplied data e.g. for one or more particular data collections etc.

As previously noted various types of data manipulation operations may be specified to be performed on some or all user specific supplied data received in some or all electronic communications for a user including one or more of the following non exclusive list aggregate all supplied data e.g. by separately storing each piece or group of supplied data in a manner associated with the user or instead combining each piece or group of supplied data into a single aggregated data collection to enable some or all of the supplied data to later be accessed in a single integrated manner separate the supplied data into multiple distinct collections e.g. into different categories or types or fields of data such that each distinct collection of data may later be accessed separately from other data collections generate one or more search indexes for the supplied data such as a distinct search index for each of multiple distinct data collections generate summaries or other attributes for particular data collections such as to determine a number of pieces or groups of data of a particular data collection that have the same values e.g. for a data collection that is grouped based on a specified facet field use at least some contents of electronic communications as parameters or values to other functions to be performed such as to perform mathematical operations based on such contents e.g. to increase or decrease an inventory count of a product based on quantity information supplied in data contents etc. More generally in at least some embodiments the data manipulation operations may include any type of data gathering or modification activities that are specified.

As previously noted one or more types of electronic communications may be used by a user of an online service in at least some embodiments including one or more of the following non exclusive list email communications text message communications such as an SMS Short Message Service message or an MMS Multimedia Messaging Service message online chat or instant messaging messages electronic messages posted to an electronic account or storage repository that is accessible by other users such as an Internet bulletin board or message board a social networking site account of the user a blog or microblog site or account associated with the user e.g. for tweets etc. video communications using Internet based or other network based voice messaging functionality etc.

In addition as previously noted in at least some embodiments the electronic communications that are sent to a user s electronic communication address provided by an online service may be sent by the user or otherwise directed by the user e.g. electronic communications that are triggered by actions of customers of a retailer user s Web site based on configuration of the Web site by the retailer user . In other embodiments and situations such electronic communications may be sent by other types of users and other situations. For example the user may register the provided electronic communication address with a third party service that provides information of a specified type to enable that provided information to be stored b the online service and later accessed by the user non exclusive examples of such a third party service include a news aggregation service an RSS feed a blog recipient for a specified blog a service with which the user has an account and for which account related information is sent etc.

Accordingly the described techniques may be used in a variety of situations by various users in various embodiments as described herein.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where information is received from a user related to providing configurable search capabilities. For example in at least some embodiments the information in block may be received as part of an initial registration of the user with a user data search service such as to create an account of the user with the service although in other situations the information may be received from a user who is already registered with the user data search service and is modifying the search related capabilities being provided. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere a particular user may in some embodiments and situations configure one or more types of search related capabilities to be provided by the user data search service such as to specify different types of searching operations that are available different ways to aggregate intake data that is received by the user data search service etc. Alternatively in some embodiments and situations a user may merely register for an account with the user data search service without providing any user specific configuration information such as if the user will instead initially rely on default search related capabilities provided by the user data search service. Furthermore in some embodiments at least some users may access and obtain at least some functionality of the user data search service without explicitly registering with the service or creating a user account with the service.

After block the routine continues to block to provide one or more electronic communication addresses to the user for use in later supplying intake data for the user to the user data search service. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments the user data search service generates one or more such electronic communication addresses that are affiliated with the user data search service such that an electronic communication sent to that electronic communication address will be forwarded to the user data search service and associates those generated electronic communication addresses with the user. In other embodiments the electronic communication addresses may be provided in other manners including to allow the user to configure at least some of the electronic communication address e.g. an initial username portion rather than the email domain . In addition as previously noted the one or more electronic communication addresses may be of one or more types such as to provide multiple electronic communication addresses that are of different types or instead that are of a single type but have different configured search capabilities.

After block the routine continues to block to configure and provide information to the user regarding at least one search interface for use in accessing the search related capabilities provided to the user with at least one of the provided search interfaces being accessed separately from the electronic communication addresses. As one example the user data search service may provide one or more APIs to enable various users to access searching capabilities of the user data search service with the current user receiving access to an interface specific to the user e.g. based on the user supplying user specific information as parameters to a shared API call such as a user specific identifier user password or other credentials etc. .

After block the routine continues to block to store information for the user related to the configurable search related capabilities to be provided to the user in association with the provided one or more electronic communication addresses and information for use as part of the provided one or more search interfaces. After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and otherwise continues to block and ends.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where an electronic communication is received via an electronic communication address provided for a user. In block the user is identified based on the electronic communication address used and configuration information for that user if any that is associated with the electronic communication address is received. In some embodiments and situations a particular user may use default search related capabilities provided by the user data search service rather than particular configured capabilities and if so information about the default capabilities may instead be retrieved from block . Alternatively in some embodiments and situations a particular user may use search related that merely include receiving and storing supplied data and later searching that data such as previously described with respect to the example customer review data discussed in .

After block the routine continues to block to retrieve data contents of the received electronic communication in accordance with any configuration information for the user. In some embodiments the retrieval of data contents may include one or more of the following retrieving contents of a body of the electronic communication retrieving contents of each of one or more file attachments to the electronic communication retrieving contents of a document or other object that is linked to or otherwise referenced by a link in the electronic communication etc. In block the routine then updates stored data for the user based on the retrieved data contents in accordance with any specified configuration information. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments and situations the retrieved data contents may merely be added to any existing stored data for the user such as to enable any or all of the stored data to later be retrieved e.g. in response to a corresponding search request . In other embodiments and situations the analysis and updating of the stored data may include performing particular operations on the retrieved data contents and or the stored data for the user such as to update or replace existing stored data in accordance with the retrieved data contents of the electronic communication. In addition in some embodiments the retrieval of the data contents and the updating of the stored data may include using particular instructions specified in the electronic communication including tags or parameters that are specified in a header and or body of the electronic communication.

After block the routine continues to block to optionally provide a confirmation response to the sender of the electronic communication and or another recipient designated in configuration information for the user. While not illustrated here in other embodiments the optional confirmation response may be followed by one or more additional communications from the sender to provide additional instructions related to the updating of stored data for the user and if so those additional instructions may be followed in such situations in accordance with corresponding configuration information for the user. After block the routine continues in the illustrated embodiment to block to index the stored data for the user for later retrieval although in other embodiments the indexing may not be performed e.g. based at least in part on the types of aggregation of stored data that is performed .

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and otherwise continues to block and ends.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where a data retrieval request is received via a search interface specific to a particular user. In block the routine then identifies the user based on the search interface used and retrieves a previously stored index if any for the user. In embodiments and situations in which search indexes are not used other indications of the stored data for the user may instead be retrieved such as to allow a non indexed search of the stored user data.

After block the routine continues to block to identify and retrieve any stored data for the user that satisfies the received request such as based on any search criteria that are specified and optionally in accordance with any configuration information specified for the user related to data retrieval operations. In block the data that is retrieved is then provided in response to the request. While not illustrated here in some embodiments the data requests may further specify one or more types of operations to be performed on the retrieved data before it is provided and if so such operations may be further performed in accordance with any corresponding configuration information for the user.

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine continues to block and otherwise continues to block and ends.
