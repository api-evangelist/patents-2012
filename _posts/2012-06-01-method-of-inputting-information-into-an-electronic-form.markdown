title: Method of inputting information into an electronic form
abstract: Described is a method to communicate to a third party information for part of an electronic form that cannot be competed and then to incorporate returned information into the electronic form. In various embodiments, while filling in an electronic form, a requestor requests assistance in the form of information from a third party such as a supervisor. The requestor specifies a range of the part requiring assistance, and copies the partial form into a field of a message. An agent acquires information concerning the partial form based on the copy operation. The message including the information on the partial form is sent to the third party. The third party inputs information into an input field concerning the input request and returns the partial form in a message. The agent incorporates the information included in the returned message into the original electronic form.

This application is a utility application claiming priority to co pending Japanese Patent Application No. 2010 266052 filed Nov. 30 2010 and co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 293 598 filed Nov. 10 2011 titled Method of Inputting Information into an Electronic Form the entireties of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to a method of inquiring about part of form input a computer program used for the method and a processor loaded with the program. The present invention particularly relates to a method of inquiring about part of form input a computer program used for the method and a processor loaded with the program that can in the case where it is necessary to inquire of a third party about part of data input while filling in an electronic form incorporate data returned from the third party into the form in a simple and versatile manner.

In recent years it has become fairly common to make some kind of public or private application not by submitting a paper medium but by means of an electronic application that is filling in an electronic application form on an electronic terminal and sending the electronic application form to its destination via a network. In such an electronic application the application form has a plurality of data input fields and an applicant inputs various information necessary for examining the application in the plurality of data input fields before pressing a send button to complete the application.

In the above described electronic application and also in an application by paper medium the applicant often encounters a difficulty in writing or inputting in the form. For example in the case where the applicant is requested to write or input a code or a class e.g. department code or charge code set regardless of his her intension while filling in the form if the applicant does not know the code or the like the applicant needs to temporarily suspend the fill in process and refer to a guide and the like or inquire of a third party such as his her superior. This process requires time and effort. Particularly in the electronic application a complex process of sending mail or the like to inquire of the third party and inputting information included in a reply into an input field is needed.

A computer implemented method is provided for inputting information into an electronic form. The method includes specifying by an operator a range of a part of an electronic form having an input field for which third party information is to be obtained by a third party. A partial form is automatically generated in a message field of an electronic message and has the input field for the third party information. The electronic message is sent to the third party. After the third party receives the electronic message the third party information is input into an input field of a return electronic message and the return electronic message is sent to the operator. The third party information in the input field of the return message is automatically input into the input field of the part of the electronic form.

In the following description specific details are set forth although it should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that the systems and methods can be practiced without at least some of the details. In some instances known features or processes are not described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.

Public and private applications are often submitted by means of an electronic application that is filling in an electronic application form on an electronic terminal and sending the electronic application form to a destination via a network. Typically the application form for the electronic application has a plurality of data input fields and an applicant inputs various information necessary for examining the application into the plurality of data input fields before pressing a send button to complete the application. The applicant often encounters difficulty in writing or inputting in the form. In one example an applicant is requested to write or input a code or a class set regardless of his her intension while filling in the form. If the applicant does not know the code or the like the applicant needs to temporarily suspend the fill in process and refer to a guide and the like. Alternatively the applicant can inquire of a third party such as his her superior. In the electronic application a complex process of sending mail or the like to inquire of the third party and inputting information included in a reply into an input field is often needed.

Various embodiments of the present invention include a method of inquiring about part of form input a computer program used for the method and a processor loaded with the program that can in the case where it is necessary to inquire of a third party about part of data input while filling in an electronic form incorporate data returned from the third party into the form in a simple and versatile manner.

The requestor s processor is loaded with software such as form agent software hereafter simply referred to as form agent messaging software e.g. Sametime by IBM mail software e.g. Notes by IBM and other software . Here there is no need to provide both the messaging software and the mail software so long as at least one of the messaging software and the mail software is provided. In terms of immediacy the messaging software is more preferable.

The form agent includes at least a form monitoring unit a partial form creation unit and a reply monitoring unit .

Though not shown the requestor s processor is also loaded with a Web browser e.g. Internet Explorer by Microsoft Corporation or Mozilla Firefox by Mozilla Foundation for filling in an electronic form. Application form editing screen examples an XXX application a YYY application by the Web browser are shown in .

Moreover the requestor s processor includes a suspended form information database DB in which for example when the person filling in the electronic form application creator requestor suspends the form fill in process in order to make a partial request according to the present invention data that has been input up to the suspension is stored. The requestor s processor further includes a form identification information database DB in which information about a created partial form an original form and an input field is stored.

The suspended form information DB and the form identification information DB need not be formed in dedicated hardware. Typically the suspended form information DB and the form identification information DB are formed in a general purpose storage device in particular a hard disk . The suspended form information DB and the form identification information DB need not necessarily be located in the requestor s processor and may be formed in an external storage device apparatus .

Though described in more detail later the form monitoring unit in the form agent monitors a clipboard in the device and issues a partial form creation instruction to the partial form creation unit upon recognizing that the application creator requestor creates a partial form in an application form a partial form in the XXX application in and copies and pastes the partial form to the messaging software the mail software or the like. Moreover in the case where the application creator requestor suspends the form fill in process with the creation of the partial form the form monitoring unit stores data that has been input up to the suspension described below in the suspended form information DB .

Though described in more detail below the partial form creation unit acquires the information copied and pasted to a send field of the messaging software as the partial form. For the created partial form the partial form creation unit stores a table associating information for specifying the original form with information of an input field included in the partial form a table associating the original form and information for specifying the original form and a table associating the input field and information input in the input field in the form identification information DB .

The reply monitoring unit determines whether or not an ID assigned to the partial form returned from the superior as the requestee is stored in the form identification information DB . In the case where the ID is stored in the form identification information DB the reply monitoring unit displays a copy to form button on the partial form displayed in a receive field of the messaging software of the requestor.

Moreover when the requestor presses the displayed copy to form button the reply monitoring unit first restores the already input information stored in the suspended form information DB and re displays it by the browser in the case where the form being edited is closed. The reply monitoring unit then copies the data of the returned partial form to the corresponding part of the original form based on the correspondence relation between the partial form and the input field included in the partial form stored in the form identification information DB .

The superior s processor is loaded with the same software as the requestor s processor such as messaging software mail software and other software .

Though not shown the requestor s processor and the superior s processor both include a display device such as a liquid crystal display and input or specifying means such as a keyboard and a mouse.

Though the term superior s processor is used here in actuality the processor used by the superior typically has the same functional structure as the requestor s processor . This embodiment merely refers to the device operated by the superior as superior s processor as an example of requestee side and shows a structure necessary for the requestee s device in .

The procedure of the embodiment of the method of inquiring about part of form input according to the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings. In this embodiment it is assumed that the application creator requestor and the superior requestee exchange messages respectively using the messaging software and .

In the following it is assumed that the application creator requestor is creating the XXX application shown in . As shown in the form of the XXX application is made up of input fields and respectively for inputting a name an account name a department code and a purpose of use.

The application creator requestor inputs data sequentially from the name field . In Tokkyo Taro and ttokkyo are input respectively in the name field and the account name field . Suppose here that the application creator requestor does not know the department code to be input in the department code field . On the other hand the application creator requestor can input the following purpose of use and so a checkmark is placed in a product development checkbox in .

The application creator requestor who does not know the department code to be input in the department code field can ask for the superior s assistance i.e. inquire of the superior by presenting a corresponding partial form to the superior. It is assumed here that the department code is unable to be specified unless the purpose of use is known. Accordingly the requestor specifies a range that includes both the department code field and the purpose of use field to create the partial form as shown in the left side of step S . Though various range specification methods can be conceived by a person skilled in the art the most typical method is dragging with a mouse not shown i.e. range specifying means .

Note that it is necessary to enable the form agent to recognize that the purpose of use item which has already been input does not need to be input or edited. For example a specific operation e.g. adding non editable is applied to the input field.

Next the requestor named Tokkyo Taro activates the messaging software . Here the messaging software may be activated before the above mentioned range specification. A communication partner with which messages are to be exchanged is the superior whose assistance the requestor wants to ask for. A display screen of the messaging software displayed on the requestor s processor is shown on the right side of . An upper portion of the screen is the receive field in which a message from the communication partner is output and displayed whereas a lower portion of the screen is the send field in which an input message to be sent to the communication partner is displayed.

The requestor copies and pastes the partial form specified in the form of the XXX application to the send field of the messaging software step S .

As mentioned earlier the form monitoring unit in the form agent monitors an application form while monitoring the clipboard. Accordingly when the requestor performs the copy and paste operation of the partial form the form monitoring unit can recognize the copy and paste operation. Upon recognizing the copy and paste operation the form monitoring unit issues the partial form creation instruction to the partial form creation unit .

Having received the partial form creation instruction the partial form creation unit acquires the information copied and pasted to the send field of the messaging software as the partial form step S . For instance in the case where the application form is edited by the browser as in this example when the partial form is copied and pasted not only text of a result of layout by the browser but also original HTML HyperText Markup Language document data is held on the clipboard.

As an alternative method in a browser e.g. Firefox that supports DOM Document Object Model as an API Application Programming Interface for enabling an HTML document to be referred to and operated from an application program information or components in the browser can be treated as DOM objects using JavaScript . This means that the range of the partial form selected by the requestor can be accessed by the DOM API. In detail the use of JavaScript enables acquisition of a DOM window object corresponding to a page and the use of a getSelection method of the window object enables acquisition of a DOM selection object corresponding to a selection range list and acquisition of a DOM range object corresponding to an individual selection range.

Therefore by implementing part or all of the functions of the form agent as an add on of the browser it is possible to acquire information about the range of the partial form selected by the requestor and information included in the range.

Having acquired the information about the partial form as described above the partial form creation unit first assigns an ID to the partial form itself so that the partial form returned from the requestee can be specified and also stores information for specifying the original form corresponding to the partial form and information for specifying the input field included in the partial form in the form identification information DB step S . Here by further assigning an ID to the original form and retaining the ID and the information for specifying the form in a separate table so that the correspondence relation with the partial form is determined based on this ID it is possible to easily deal with such a case as extracting different parts of the same form as partial forms and requesting different third parties to input these partial forms or submitting applications of different purposes using the same form.

The information for specifying the input field included in the partial form is also used to prevent even if a field irrelevant to the partial form is included in the reply to the input request such a field from being copied to the original field in particular to prevent a non editable field from being copied to the original form. That is in the case where a non editable input field is included in the partial form by some kind of specification by the requestor as mentioned earlier the partial form creation unit does not include an ID of the input field in the table and only includes an ID of a remaining input field in the table.

Note that an ID assigned to each input field in the partial form may be an ID newly set in the partial form or an ordinal position of appearance of the input field in the corresponding original form.

In the first row and the second row show an example of the case of extracting different parts of the same form as partial forms and requesting different third parties to input the partial forms. On the other hand the first row and the third row show an example of the case of opening a form in the same URL for different applications as can be understood with reference to .

Referring back to the requestor processing in after copying and pasting the partial form of the specified range to the messaging software the requestor adds some kind of request message e.g. What should I put for department code as shown in to the pasted partial form on an input field of the messaging software and then sends the partial form to the requestee i.e. the superior in this example step S . A below described reply button can also be added for the requestee in addition to the message. The button can be easily displayed by a scripting language program.

In the case where the form agent acquires the information about the partial form not by the copy and paste operation but by the above described alternative method the form agent needs to paste the partial form to the messaging software or the mail software as described below . This function can be realized by using an API provided by the messaging software or the mail software or by implementing a function capable of acquiring the information about the partial form as an add on of the messaging software or the mail software and notifying to the implemented add on function by the form agent .

In the case where the form which is being filled in on the browser is temporarily closed after sending the partial form the form monitoring unit stores the information of the suspended form in the suspended form information database DB step S .

Here it is sufficient to store a combination of an ID of each already input field and information input in the input field as shown in the example of shows that Tokkyo Taro as the name ID 1 ttokkyo as the account name ID 2 and product development as the purpose of use ID 4 have already been input so long as the information can be obtained using the ID in the original form as a key. As a result the restoration of the already input information step S described below in the restoration of the data in the suspended form can be achieved by the same process as copying the input information from the returned partial form to the original form step S described below .

After the requestor sends the partial form to the superior by the messaging software the form agent enters a state of monitoring by the reply monitoring unit step S .

Upon receiving the partial form from the requestor via the messaging software the superior first presses the reply button added to the partial form step S . is a diagram showing a display screen of the messaging software on the superior s processor where a state of receiving the partial form from the requestor is shown on the left side. In detail the partial form with the reply button and the added message are displayed in a receive field .

When the superior presses the reply button only the partial form in the information displayed in the receive field is copied to a send field as shown on the right side of .

The superior then inputs a specific code e.g. AB 012 in the department code input field in the partial form displayed in the send field in order to notify the requestor of the requested department code step S . Meanwhile the superior is not allowed to modify the purpose of use item because the purpose of use item is set as non editable by the form agent . Even if the superior can modify the purpose of use item the modification is ignored by the form agent as described above. Following this the superior adds a reply message e.g. Please use this code as shown in to the partial form in the send field and sends the partial form step S .

Note that the partial form sent received by the messaging software and is accompanied by the ID assigned by the form agent as described above.

When the partial form is returned from the superior as the requestee the reply monitoring unit in the form agent checks whether or not the ID assigned to the returned partial form is stored in the form identification information DB step S . In the case where the ID is not stored the reply monitoring unit abandons the returned partial form without performing subsequent processing.

In the case where the ID is stored on the other hand the reply monitoring unit displays the copy to form button on the partial form displayed in the receive field of the messaging software of the requestor as shown in step S .

When the requestor application creator presses the displayed copy to form button step S the reply monitoring unit first restores the form data stored in the suspended form information DB and re displays it by the browser in the case where the form being edited is closed step S . Next based on the correspondence relation of each input field stored as described above the reply monitoring unit copies the data of the returned partial form to the corresponding part of the original form the XXX application in this example i.e. the department code input field in this example as shown in step S . This copy operation by the reply monitoring unit can be realized for example as an add on of the browser.

As described above according to the embodiment of the present invention in the case where the superior s assistance for part of data input becomes necessary while the employee is creating the application in the electronic form the input field corresponding to the part is copied and pasted to the messaging software as the partial form and sent to the superior and when the partial form including the data input by the superior is returned the partial form is semi automatically incorporated into the original electronic form. This facilitates electronic form creation.

Though the above embodiment describes the case where the messaging software and are used as the means for sending the partial form to the superior the present invention is not limited to such. Software having a mail function the mail software and may instead be used though less favorable in terms of immediacy. In this case the copy and paste operation of the partial form is performed in a message field of send mail. When the superior replies a receive message is left in reply mail so that the superior can input data in the input field of the partial form in the receive message. This makes it unnecessary to provide the reply button in the above embodiment. The other structure is the same as above. For example when the ID of the partial form in the reply mail matches the ID stored in the form agent the form agent displays the copy to form button in the reply mail.

Moreover the means of sending the partial form to the superior is not limited to the messaging software or the mail software as any other software capable of the copy and paste operation and the message exchange is also applicable.

Though the above embodiment describes the electronic form created by the browser as an example the present invention is not limited to such and the electronic form may be created by any software capable of specifying the range and extracting the information of the copy source.
