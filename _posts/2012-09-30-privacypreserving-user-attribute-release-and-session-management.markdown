title: Privacy-preserving user attribute release and session management
abstract: An information processing system comprises one or more processing devices of at least one processing platform. In one embodiment, the system comprises cloud infrastructure that is configured to validate an externally-generated security token issued to a user, to extract one or more claims from the validated externally-generated security token, and to create a session object to hold the extracted claim or claims. The cloud infrastructure issues an internally-generated security token based on the session object that allows the user to be identified to a protected resource. The internally-generated security token is validated in conjunction with a request from the user for access to the protected resource, and information associated with at least one extracted claim is selectively released responsive to validation of the internally-generated security token. Access of the user to the protected resource is granted or denied based on the selectively-released information.

The field relates generally to information processing systems and more particularly to controlling access to protected resources in such systems.

An increasing number of companies and other enterprises are reducing their costs by migrating portions of their information technology IT infrastructure to cloud service providers. For example virtual data centers and other types of systems comprising cloud infrastructure are coming into widespread use. Typical cloud service offerings include for example Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Platform as a Service PaaS and Software as a Service SaaS . In cloud based information processing systems enterprises in effect become tenants of the cloud service providers.

A given enterprise tenancy maintained in cloud infrastructure by a cloud service provider will typically comprise a large number of protected resources such as applications computational resources and storage resources. It is important that access to such resources be controlled in a secure manner. In one conventional arrangement a user can establish a session with the cloud service provider in order to access one or more of the protected resources of the enterprise tenancy. This may involve the user obtaining an attestation or other security token from an identity provider and presenting it to the cloud service provider in order to obtain access to the protected resources.

However arrangements of this type often require that the access control entity either maintain a live connection back to the identity provider or provide local persistent storage for user identifiers and other associated security attributes.

The maintenance of a live connection back to the identity provider is problematic in that it complicates session management and introduces additional opportunities for attackers. It may also present a conflict with well established network perimeter controls.

The use of local persistent storage to hold user attributes is also problematic in that the private user attribute information that is held persistently by the cloud service provider is directly vulnerable in the event that the security of the cloud infrastructure is breached.

Also persistent storage of such information will often require the cloud service provider to maintain one or more access control list ACL databases in order to support aliasing between a user identifier or other user attribute associated with the security token obtained from the identity provider and a locally defined identifier for use within the cloud infrastructure. Provisioning and maintaining such ACL databases can be unduly costly and inefficient for the cloud service provider.

Conventional single sign on SSO approaches are also problematic in that such approaches generally assume that the cloud service provider has an on going ability to validate a security token with the original external source of that token. As indicated previously it is often not possible in cloud environments to maintain a live connection back to an external identity provider in order to support such functionality.

Embodiments of the present invention provide improved access control for protected resources of cloud infrastructure or other types of IT infrastructure through privacy preserving user attribute release and associated session management. A given embodiment can comprehensively manage the transformation of user attribute information for controlling access to different protected resources in a manner that provides optimal preservation of user privacy in these attributes. Risk of loss of user attribute information is therefore significantly reduced even in the event of a breach in cloud infrastructure security.

In one embodiment cloud infrastructure of an information processing system comprises one or more processing devices of at least one processing platform. The cloud infrastructure is configured to validate an externally generated security token issued to a user to extract one or more claims from the validated externally generated security token and to create a session object to hold the extracted claim or claims. The cloud infrastructure issues an internally generated security token based on the session object that allows the user to be identified to a protected resource. The internally generated security token is validated in conjunction with a request from the user for access to the protected resource and information associated with at least one extracted claim is selectively released responsive to validation of the internally generated security token. Access of the user to the protected resource is granted or denied based on the selectively released information.

By way of example the cloud infrastructure may be more particularly configured to issue a plurality of internally generated security tokens including a first internally generated security token to represent that a valid login session has been established for the user and additional internally generated security tokens comprising respective service specific security tokens configured to permit the user to prove its identity to respective services provided in local domains of the cloud infrastructure.

One or more of the embodiments described herein can be advantageously configured to eliminate the need to maintain any live connection back to an external identity provider as well as the need to persistently store user attribute information within the cloud infrastructure. In addition the complexities associated with provisioning and maintenance of ACL databases are avoided.

Illustrative embodiments of the present invention will be described herein with reference to exemplary information processing systems and associated computers servers storage devices and other processing devices. It is to be appreciated however that the invention is not restricted to use with the particular illustrative system and device configurations shown. Accordingly the term information processing system as used herein is intended to be broadly construed so as to encompass for example processing systems comprising private or public cloud computing or storage systems as well as other types of processing systems comprising physical or virtual processing resources in any combination.

The enterprise may comprise a company business organization or any other entity that interacts with a cloud service provider.

The cloud infrastructure may comprise for example software products running on a processing platform of a cloud service provider although other types of products including hardware products or virtualized products may additionally or alternatively be utilized. The cloud infrastructure may be viewed as comprising physical infrastructure and associated virtualization infrastructure running on the physical infrastructure.

The cloud infrastructure or portions thereof may be implemented using one or more processing devices of a processing platform. Examples of processing platforms that may form portions of the cloud infrastructure in system will be described in more detail below in conjunction with .

Although the present embodiment is described herein with reference to cloud infrastructure other embodiments can be implemented using other types of IT infrastructure as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.

User devices . . . N associated with enterprise utilize services provided by the cloud service provider in cloud infrastructure . The user devices may be configured to allow their corresponding users to access the cloud infrastructure via connections established over a network. Such a network although not expressly illustrated in may comprise for example a global computer network such as the Internet a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN a satellite network a telephone or cable network a cellular network a wireless network such as WiFi or WiMAX or various portions or combinations of these and other types of networks.

A given one of the user devices in the system may be associated with a single user or multiple users may be associated with a single device. The term user as utilized herein is intended to be broadly construed so as to encompass for example a human user associated with a given device or set of devices an automated user such as an application or other hardware or software component associated with a given device or any other entity that may control that device.

The cloud service provider maintains a tenancy in cloud infrastructure for the enterprise . The tenancy comprises sets of protected resources . . . L having respective access control modules . . . L. By way of example the tenancy may comprise a data center or other type of storage system or computing system maintained in cloud infrastructure for use by the enterprise . Such functionality may be provided to the enterprise by the cloud service provider using IaaS PaaS or SaaS or combinations of such cloud services. The protected resources may comprise for example data applications services or any other sensitive information in any combination.

A data center or other storage system or computing system maintained in cloud infrastructure may comprise multiple storage arrays possibly including storage products such as VNX and Symmetrix VMAX both commercially available from EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass. A variety of other storage or computing products may be utilized to implement portions of the cloud infrastructure .

In order to provide secure access to the protected resources via the access control modules the cloud infrastructure implements a number of additional modules including a session management module a token generator a claims extractor and a metadata mapper . The modules operate in conjunction with one or more authorization policies to control user access to the protected resources . As will be described in more detail below the cloud infrastructure utilizes these modules to provide privacy preserving user attribute release and session management for users associated with enterprise .

The cloud infrastructure in the present embodiment is configured to validate an externally generated security token issued to a user by an external identity provider to extract one or more claims from the validated externally generated security token in claims extractor and to create a session object in session management module to hold the extracted claim or claims. The cloud infrastructure issues an internally generated security token from token generator based on the session object that allows the user to be identified to a given one of the protected resources . The internally generated security token is validated in conjunction with a request from the user for access to the given protected resource and information associated with at least one extracted claim is selectively released possibly utilizing the metadata mapper responsive to validation of the internally generated security token. Access of the user to the protected resource is then granted or denied based on the selectively released information.

The identity provider is referred to herein as external in that it is external to the cloud infrastructure of the cloud service provider. Accordingly security tokens issued to enterprise users by the identity provider may be viewed as examples of what are more generally referred to herein as externally generated security tokens. This is in contrast to what are referred to herein as internally generated security tokens which are assumed to be generated by the cloud service provider or an associated entity internal to the cloud infrastructure . Thus the designations of external and internal in the context of the present embodiment should be understood to refer to internal and external relative to the cloud service provider that controls access to the tenancy and its associated protected resources . In other embodiments the identity provider may be implemented at least in part within the enterprise . Moreover other designations of internal and external relative to other system entities controlling access to one or more protected resources may be applied in other embodiments of the present invention.

It should also be understood that the various modules and are merely exemplary and other embodiments may be configured to provide privacy preserving user attribute release and session management using other types and arrangements of modules. For example functionality associated with separate modules in the embodiment may be combined into a single module in other embodiments.

The user devices and portions of the cloud infrastructure may be implemented using a variety of different arrangements of what are generally referred to herein as processing devices. A given such processing device generally comprises at least one processor and an associated memory and implements one or more functional modules for controlling certain features of the system .

The processor in a given processing device of system may comprise a microprocessor a microcontroller an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other type of processing circuitry as well as portions or combinations of such circuitry elements.

The memory may comprise random access memory RAM read only memory ROM or other types of memory in any combination. The memory and other memories disclosed herein may be viewed as examples of what are more generally referred to as computer program products storing executable computer program code.

In addition to a processor and a memory a processing device will generally include a variety of other types of circuitry such as network interface circuitry that allows the processing device to communicate with other processing devices over one or more networks. The network interface circuitry may comprise one or more conventional transceivers.

The various modules and other elements of cloud infrastructure may be implemented at least in part in the form of software that is stored and executed by respective memory and processor elements of one or more processing devices. Accordingly as indicated previously system elements such as tenancy modules and authorization policies and identity provider may therefore be implemented using one or more processing platforms each comprising multiple processing devices. Such processing platforms may comprise cloud infrastructure of a cloud service provider.

The system in the present embodiment implements one or more processes to provide privacy preserving user attribute release and session management in cloud infrastructure for users associated with enterprise . An example of such a process will be described below in conjunction with but it is to be appreciated that numerous other types of processes may be used in other embodiments.

It is to be appreciated that the particular set of elements shown in for providing privacy preserving user attribute release and session management in cloud infrastructure is presented by way of example and in other embodiments additional or alternative elements may be used.

The operation of the system will now be described in greater detail with reference to the flow diagram of which illustrates a set of operations performed by the cloud infrastructure in an illustrative embodiment. The process as shown includes steps through . The steps may be performed by at least one processing device that includes a processor coupled to a memory and is implemented in one or more processing platforms of the cloud infrastructure .

In step an externally generated security token issued to a user is validated. The externally generated security token is assumed in the present embodiment to be generated by external identity provider although other entities external to the cloud infrastructure may generate this security token. Other system entities may alternatively issue the security token to the user or multiple entities can collaborate in generation and issuance of a given security token. The externally generated security token in the present embodiment is assumed to be received in the cloud infrastructure in conjunction with an access request from the corresponding user although it may alternatively be received in other ways.

The user referred to in step is assumed to be associated with one of the user devices of the enterprise . It is further assumed that the enterprise has previously established a trust relationship with the cloud service provider of the cloud infrastructure via exchange of certificates or by other known techniques. As an example the enterprise and cloud service provider may establish direct trust by exchange of X.509v3 certificates. Also metadata indicating a particular external identity provider that the cloud service provider should utilize may be made available by the enterprise to the cloud service provider.

The identity provider generates and issues the security token referred to in conjunction with step upon successful authentication of the user by that identity provider. The term security token as used herein is intended to encompass by way of example an authentication assertion or other type of authentication information indicative of successful authentication of the user by the identity provider.

A given authentication assertion will generally comprise at least one claim expressed in security assertion mark up language SAML . Accordingly the externally generated security token received by the cloud infrastructure in the present embodiment may comprise multiple SAML claims or other types of user attributes. The term claim as used herein should be understood to encompass a SAML claim or other set of one or more user attributes that is associated with the security token. An advantage of using SAML claims is that such claims avoid the need for online validation of the corresponding assertion.

The involvement of the identity provider can be initiated by the user its associated enterprise or the cloud infrastructure . For example the externally generated security token may be received in the cloud infrastructure in conjunction with an initial access request from the user within a corresponding login session. In this exemplary proactive case the user access request is accompanied by the externally generated security token and the cloud infrastructure reacts accordingly.

However if the externally generated security token is not received in the cloud infrastructure in conjunction with an initial access request from the user within a corresponding login session the cloud infrastructure may direct the user to the external identity provider so that the user can obtain the appropriate externally generated security token. In this exemplary reactive case the user access request initially arrives without the externally generated security token and so the user is therefore directed to visit the identity provider to obtain the token. This reactive case may involve redirecting the initial access request received by the cloud infrastructure to the external identity provider . Multiple levels of redirection are also possible. For example a first identity provider to which the request is redirected by the cloud infrastructure can itself redirect the request to another identity provider and so on.

In step claims are extracted from the validated externally generated security token. As noted above such claims may comprise SAML claims or other sets of one or more user attributes. The claims may be extracted using the claims extractor module of the cloud infrastructure . Extraction of multiple claims is not a requirement and thus in other embodiments this step may involve extraction of only a single claim.

In step a session object is created to hold the extracted claims. Such a session object may be created for example by the session management module of the cloud infrastructure . The term hold as used in this context of holding extracted claims is intended to be broadly construed to encompass a wide variety of different techniques for associating extracted claims with a session object.

In step an internally generated security token is issued based on the session object to identify the user to one of the protected resources . This security token may be generated and issued by the token generator . The internally generated security token in the present embodiment is assumed to be generated for a corresponding login session of the user. Accordingly steps through may be viewed as essentially exchanging the externally issued security token referred to in step for an internally generated security token that represents a current login session.

Although only a single internally generated security token is referred to in step such an internal token issuance may more particularly comprise issuing a plurality of internally generated security tokens including a first internally generated security token to represent that a valid login session has been established for the user and multiple additional internally generated security tokens comprising respective service specific security tokens configured to permit the user to prove its identity to respective services provided in one or more local domains of the cloud infrastructure. Such local domains may correspond for example to respective sets of the protected resources and or their associated access control modules or other respective internal portions of the cloud infrastructure .

In step the internally generated security token refelTed to in step is validated in conjunction with a request from the user for access to the protected resource. The validation process of step may involve for example validating the internally generated security token in an SSO service of a local domain of the cloud infrastructure.

Different types of validation are used for the externally generated security token and the internally generated security token in the present embodiment. For example the externally generated security token is assumed to be configured for offline validation that does not require access to its corresponding external issuing authority and the internally generated security token is configured for online validation that does require access to its corresponding internal issuing authority. The token generator may be viewed as an example of an internal issuing authority as the latter term is used herein.

In step information associated with at least one of the extracted claims is selectively released responsive to validation of the internally generated security token in step . By way of example the selectively released information may comprise one or more user attributes from at least one extracted claim including at least an authenticated identifier of the user and possibly other authentication information associated with one or more assertions conveyed in conjunction with the externally generated security token. In determining the particular information to selectively release the metadata mapper may be used to transform one or more of the extracted claims for example to meet the particular requirements of one of the access control modules . The selectively released information in this case comprises information associated with the transformed claim.

It should also be noted that the selective release of information in step may be controlled in accordance with one or more specified policies such as one or more of the authorization policies .

Metadata mapping in step can be performed in a variety of different ways including based on class or type of user or on a per resource or per tenancy basis. In general the approach of transforming the claims via metadata mapping ensures that any application or other protected resource in the tenancy can support the use of authorization policies expressed in any standardized form such as in XACML 3.0 language without any prior agreement on the attribute namespace that is to be used to express the corresponding access control rules. Accordingly no prior coordination or agreement is needed between entities such as cloud service provider tenant administrator application developer and policy administration point defining the authorization policy.

Selective release of information associated with at least one extracted claim may involve releasing different sets of one or more user attributes in conjunction with different access requests directed to different ones of the protected resources such that a given one of the protected resources is unaware of all the user attributes contained in the extracted claims. This serves to preserve privacy in certain ones of the user attributes relative to certain ones of the protected resources.

As one example the cloud infrastructure may redact certain attributes upon entry into the tenancy then release a first subset of the remaining attributes to an application A and then subsequently release a disjoint or overlapping subset of the remaining attributes to another application B. In conjunction with each such release the particular released subsets of attributes are transformed into respective namespaces understood by the respective applications. This allows the application developers to implement respective authorization policies that are decoupled from and independent of any particular attribute management processes employed by the enterprise . Similar advantages are provided for cloud services or other types of protected resources implemented in tenancy .

The step of selectively releasing information may be controlled at least in part by the internal issuing authority noted above. The cloud infrastructure may be configured for example such that services within the tenancy need to contact the internal issuing authority to validate the service specific tokens. At this time the internal issuing authority can selectively release a subset of the user attribute information. Again the service or other protected resource that is the subject of the access request from the user remains unaware of at least a portion of the information associated with the extracted claims.

In the present embodiment the cloud service provider can utilize an attribute release policy to selectively release information about the user to applications or other protected resources that are hosted in the tenancy . The scope of a given attribute release policy may be limited to a specific application or other protected resource set of applications or other protected resources or the entire tenancy. The attribute release policy may also be managed comprehensively across the cloud infrastructure .

In step access of the user to the protected resource is granted or denied based on the information selectively released in step . In the present embodiment access of the user to the protected resource can be granted or denied without requiring any further contact between the cloud infrastructure and the external identity provider other than that associated with any redirection of the initial access request to the external identity provider. The present embodiment therefore eliminates the need to maintain any live connection back from the cloud infrastructure to the external identity provider .

As noted above step may involve issuance of multiple internally generated security tokens including a first internally generated security token to represent that a valid login session has been established for the user and multiple additional internally generated security tokens comprising respective service specific security tokens configured to permit the user to prove its identity to different services provided in the cloud infrastructure . Accordingly steps through may be repeated for different access requests received from the user within the login session using different ones of the service specific security tokens.

By way of example the user can establish a single login session with the tenancy that requires access to multiple applications in that tenancy and for each access to a different application present a different service specific security token to obtain access using steps through of the process. Once the user ends the login session by logging out the next access of that user will start a new login session once again involving execution of the full set of steps through . After the user logs out the tenancy does not retain any user attribute information with the possible exception of any information required to be retained by law within the corresponding jurisdiction.

In some embodiments session state information may be provided to the user periodically or otherwise so as to facilitate processing of additional access requests from the user within a given login session. Such session state information may be provided by the session management module .

Upon termination of the login session the cloud infrastructure deletes the extracted claims including the selectively released information so as to preserve privacy in associated user attributes. Thus in the present embodiment the user attributes associated with the extracted claims are stored in memory only for the duration of the login session and are not written to disk or other persistent storage. Because this illustrative embodiment avoids the need to persistently store user attribute information within the cloud infrastructure risk of loss of user attribute information is significantly reduced even in the event of a breach in cloud infrastructure security. Audit compliance is also facilitated. Moreover seamless federated access to a diverse array of protected resources is provided in a manner that exhibits significantly reduced overhead and complexity relative to conventional arrangements.

The particular processing operations and other system functionality described in conjunction with the flow diagram of are presented by way of illustrative example only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. Alternative embodiments can use other types of processing operations for providing privacy preserving user attribute release and session management.

For example the ordering of the process steps may be varied in other embodiments or certain steps may be performed concurrently with one another rather than serially. Also one or more of the process steps may be repeated periodically or on an as needed basis responsive to particular events. As mentioned above the steps of the process are assumed to be implemented in a processing platform comprising at least one processing device having a processor coupled to a memory.

It is to be appreciated that privacy preserving user attribute release and session management functionality such as that described in conjunction with the flow diagram of can be implemented at least in part in the form of one or more software programs stored in memory and executed by a processor of a processing device such as a computer or server. As mentioned previously a memory or other storage device having such program code embodied therein is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a computer program product. 

The embodiments described in conjunction with can provide a number of significant advantages relative to conventional practice. For example a given such embodiment can be configured to provide improved access control for protected resources in tenancy of cloud infrastructure through privacy preserving user attribute release and associated session management. A given embodiment can comprehensively manage the transformation of user attribute information for controlling access to different protected resources in a manner that provides optimal preservation of user privacy in these attributes. Risk of loss of user attribute information is therefore significantly reduced even in the event of a breach in cloud infrastructure security. Moreover these advantages are achieved while also avoiding the drawbacks associated with maintaining a live connection back to an external identity provider persistently store storing user attribute information within the cloud infrastructure and provisioning and maintenance of ACL databases.

Referring now to portions of the information processing system in this embodiment comprise cloud infrastructure . The cloud infrastructure comprises virtual machines VMs . . . M implemented using a hypervisor . The hypervisor runs on physical infrastructure . The cloud infrastructure further comprises sets of applications . . . M running on respective ones of the virtual machines . . . M under the control of the hypervisor .

Although only a single hypervisor is shown in the embodiment of the system may of course include multiple hypervisors each providing a set of virtual machines using at least one underlying physical machine.

An example of a commercially available hypervisor platform that may be used to implement hypervisor and possibly other portions of the cloud infrastructure of information processing system in one or more embodiments of the invention is the VMware vSphere which may have an associated virtual infrastructure management system such as the VMware vCenter .

As indicated previously the system may be implemented using one or more processing platforms. One or more of the processing modules or other components of system may therefore each run on a computer server storage device or other processing platform element. A given such element may be viewed as an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a processing device. The cloud infrastructure shown in may represent at least a portion of one processing platform. Another example of such a processing platform is processing platform shown in .

The processing platform in this embodiment comprises a portion of the system and includes a plurality of processing devices denoted . . . K which communicate with one another over a network . The network may comprise any type of network such as a WAN a LAN a satellite network a telephone or cable network or various portions or combinations of these and other types of networks.

The processing device in the processing platform comprises a processor coupled to a memory . The processor may comprise a microprocessor a microcontroller an ASIC an FPGA or other type of processing circuitry as well as portions or combinations of such circuitry elements and the memory which may be viewed as an example of a computer program product having executable computer program code embodied therein may comprise RAM ROM or other types of memory in any combination.

Also included in the processing device is network interface circuitry which is used to interface the processing device with the network and other system components and may comprise conventional transceivers.

The other processing devices of the processing platform are assumed to be configured in a manner similar to that shown for processing device in the figure.

Again the particular processing platform shown in the figure is presented by way of example only and system may include additional or alternative processing platforms as well as numerous distinct processing platforms in any combination with each such platform comprising one or more computers servers storage devices or other processing devices.

Multiple elements of information processing system may be collectively implemented on a common processing platform of the type shown in or or each such element may be implemented on a separate processing platform.

In the embodiment an information processing system comprises an enterprise that interacts with a cloud service provider . The enterprise comprises a plurality of clients including a browser client and a non browser client .

On the cloud service provider side of the system a plurality of SSO clients are associated with respective application resources . The SSO clients interact with a module that includes a local domain SSO service a SAML claims bridge and a SAML request processor RP component .

Additional components on the enterprise side of the system include an identity provider module that comprises a RESTful session token service and a SAML identity provider IdP . Coupled to the identity provider module is a Microsoft Active Directory MS AD component that is implemented based on Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP .

Assume that a user associated with one of the clients of enterprise attempts to access one of the application resources in the cloud service provider portion of the system . If the user does not present the appropriate externally generated security token the corresponding access request is redirected to the local domain SSO service which in turn redirects the access request to the identity provider module in order to allow the user to obtain the externally generated security token. The user logs in to the SAML IdP which interacts with the LDAP MS AD component and is provided an assertion upon successful authentication. The assertion may be provided either directly from SAML IdP in the case of browser client or indirectly via RESTful session token service in the case of non browser client .

It is also assumed in this embodiment that the security token comprises an authentication assertion containing claims. The claims associated with this assertion are further assumed to comprise one or more sets of user attributes.

The user request is then redirected back to the cloud service provider . The cloud service provider accepts and validates the authentication assertion associated with the externally generated security token and extracts the claims. Metadata mappings are referenced and claims may be transformed and cached using the SAML bridge . The authenticated user identifier is passed on to the local domain SSO service which creates one or more internally generated security tokens for the user.

The user request including the internally generated security token from the local domain SSO service is redirected to the appropriate SSO client associated with the requested application resource . The SSO client has a trust relationship with the local domain SSO service indicated by a dashed line in the figure through which it can validate the internally generated security token.

Once the token is validated the SAML bridge is used to transform the claims extracted from the externally generated security token so as to selectively release user attribute information to the SSO client . The SSO client uses this selectively released information to determine if the user request for access to the application resource should be granted or denied.

As in previously described embodiments the local domain SSO service in the embodiment can issue multiple internally generated security tokens in order to allow the user to access multiple distinct application resources within a given login session.

It should again be emphasized that the above described embodiments of the invention are presented for purposes of illustration only. Many variations and other alternative embodiments may be used. For example the disclosed techniques are applicable to a wide variety of other types of information processing systems processing platforms and processing device configurations enterprises information technology infrastructure tenancies protected resources and associated access control modules. Accordingly the particular configuration of system and device elements shown in FIGS. and and the process shown in can be varied in other embodiments. Moreover any assumptions made above in the course of describing the illustrative embodiments should also be viewed as exemplary rather than as requirements or limitations of the invention. Numerous other alternative embodiments within the scope of the appended claims will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
