title: Floating head contour following holder for ultrasonic testing
abstract: An ultrasonic transducer holder with a floating head is disclosed. This transducer holder allows the waterpath of the ultrasonic signal to be maintained over a contoured surface. Maintaining a constant waterpath between a transducer and the piece being inspected allows for inspection of surfaces that normally would not be capable of inspection by prior ultrasonic transducer holders.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to contract number 5117182 between the United States Air Force and United Technologies Corporation.

The present disclosure generally relates to testing equipment and more specifically relates to the inspection of equipment and materials immersed in a liquid by ultrasonic signals.

Ultrasonic testing has become a popular method for flaw detection in new as well as in service materials and equipment. Such testing can determine the size and position of most flaws in the material and equipment. These flaws can be surface cracks imbedded cracks voids in the material non uniform or non desirable density and the like. This information has allowed technicians to determine whether the inspected equipment is still in working condition and potentially how long the equipment will remain in working condition.

One industry which has benefitted greatly from ultrasonic testing has been aircraft manufacturing and maintenance. Modern aircraft require high accuracy parts to remain intact during operation both on the outside and the inside. Such parts may include but are not limited to compressor fan blades turbine fan blades airfoils and the like. Flaws in the original manufacture or due to subsequent damage from use of such parts could result in the parts not functioning properly and damaging themselves or the rest of the aircraft. Ultrasonic testing allows such potentially harmful flaws to be found before they become dangerous to the aircraft.

Ultrasonic testing begins with a transducer bombarding the object in question with sound waves. When the sound waves come upon a flaw in the object or the opposite side of the object the wave is reflected. The transducer receives these reflected waves and turns them into an electrical signal. A computer then converts the electrical signals from the transducer into a graph that shows the size and position of the flaw.

Sound waves are transmitted better in some liquids such as water than in air. Thus to increase the sensitivity of the scans the object in question can be immersed in a tank of water or other suitable medium. The transducer is also submerged to create a waterpath a path between the transducer and the object through the water.

The transducers are typically held by a transducer holder which is attached to an actuator by a connection rod. This actuator allows for the transducer holder to be moved in a variety of directions such as but not limited to along an axis parallel to the connection rod and along two axes perpendicular to the connection rod. The actuator may be controlled by a computer operating a pre programmed algorithm.

While effective the ultrasonic testing method is limited by the shape of the object being tested. Typically the object must be relatively planar and not have complicated surface geometry. Additionally the waterpath needs to remain constant to get consistent readings from the transducers. Clearly a need has arisen for a mechanism that would allow an operator to use ultrasonic testing to scan objects of more complex shape and design while maintaining a constant waterpath.

In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure an ultrasonic scanning assembly having a transducer holder is disclosed. The transducer holder may include a floating head connected to an actuator by a connection rod at least one sliding pin slidably mounted to the floating head a transducer block having at least one transducer mount and connected to the at least one sliding pin and being slidably mounted to the floating head and a plurality of feet disposed on a bottom surface of the transducer block.

In a refinement the transducer block has a rotational frame rotationally connected to the at least one slider pin and has a first rotational axis.

In a further refinement the transducer block is rotationally connected to the rotational frame and has a second rotational axis perpendicular to the first rotational axis.

In another refinement the transducer holder further comprises at least one transducer each transducer disposed in a transducer mount.

In another refinement the actuator is electronically controlled by a computer running a pre programmed algorithm.

In yet another refinement the transducer holder is submerged in water in an immersion tank during operation.

In yet another refinement the at least one transducer mount is oriented such that when a transducer is mounted the transducer points towards a smooth finished surface disposed on the transducer block. The smooth finished surface may reflect a sound wave emitted by the transducer at a known angle.

In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure a transducer holder is disclosed. The transducer holder comprising a floating head and at least one sliding pin. The sliding pin may be slidably mounted to the floating head. The transducer holder may further include a transducer block having at least one transducer mount and connected to the at least one sliding pin and being slidably mounted to the floating head. The transducer holder may further comprise a plurality of feet disposed on a bottom surface of the transducer block.

In a refinement the transducer block has a rotational frame rotationally connected to the at least one slider pin and has a first rotational axis.

In a further refinement the transducer block is rotationally connected to the rotational frame and has a second rotational axis perpendicular to the first rotational axis.

In another refinement there are exactly three feet disposed on the bottom surface of the transducer block.

In another refinement the transducer holder further comprises at least one transducer each transducer disposed in a transducer mount.

In yet another refinement the at least one transducer mount is oriented such that when a transducer is mounted the transducer points towards a smooth finished surface disposed on the transducer block. The smooth finished surface may further reflect a sound wave emitted by the transducer at a known angle.

In yet another aspect of the disclosure a method of ultrasonically testing an airfoil is disclosed. The method may comprise the steps of mounting an airfoil to a mount disposed inside an immersion tank filling the immersion tank with a liquid medium the immersion tank constructed such that a liquid may be held within the tank and around the equipment mount and having a top surface of the tank open controlling an actuator the actuator comprising a connection rod by a joystick electronically connected to the actuator and positioning a transducer holder such that a plurality of feet are in physical contact with a surface of the airfoil. The transducer holder may comprise a floating head connected to the connection rod at least one sliding pin slidably mounted to the floating head a transducer block having at least one transducer mount and connected to the at least one sliding pin and being slidably mounted to the floating head the plurality of feet disposed on a bottom surface of the transducer block and at least one transducer each transducer disposed in a transducer mount. The method of ultrasonically testing an airfoil may further comprise moving the transducer holder across the surface of the airfoil such that the plurality of feet are in contact with the surface of the airfoil and a constant waterpath from the at least one transducer to the surface of the airfoil is maintained and emitting sound waves from the at least one transducer and receiving the sound waves reflected by a flaw and or surface of the airfoil by the at least one transducer.

In a refinement the transducer block has a rotational frame rotationally connected to the at least one slider pin and has a first rotational axis.

In a further refinement the transducer block is rotationally connected to the rotational frame and has a second rotational axis perpendicular to the first rotational axis.

In another refinement the actuator is controlled by a pre programmed algorithm run on a computer electronically connected to the actuator.

In yet another refinement the emitted sound waves are directed to the airfoil by a smooth finished surface disposed on the transducer block. The emitted sound waves are reflected by the smooth finished surface at a known angle towards the airfoil.

These and other aspects and features of the present disclosure will be better understood in light of the following detailed description when read in light of the accompanying drawings.

It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and that the disclosed embodiments are sometimes illustrated diagrammatically and in partial views. In certain instances details which are not necessary for an understanding of this disclosure or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted. It should be understood of course that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments illustrated herein.

Referring now to the drawings and with specific reference to a perspective view of an ultrasonic scan of a piece of equipment specifically an airfoil in progress by a transducer mounted in a transducer holder is shown. The airfoil is supported by a mounting inside an immersion tank . The immersion tank can be filled with water or another suitable medium which will allow for a better transmission of sound waves than in air.

As shown in when an emitted sound wave comes in contact with a flaw defect the sound wave may be reflected back towards the transducer . The transducer may pick up the reflected sound wave and may convert the wave into a signal which may be transmitted to a computer to be displayed as a graph.

The graph may be marked with distance marking which correspond to the distance the sound wave traveled before being reflected as well as the horizontal displacement from a designated starting point. Thus the graph may allow an operator to determine the size and position of the flaw defect in the airfoil .

Referring now to an ultrasonic scanning assembly constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure is shown and generally referred to by reference numeral . As shown the ultrasonic scanning assembly may be used in conjunction with the immersion tank . The ultrasonic scanning assembly may include an actuator having three degrees of motion for positioning the transducer holder inside the immersion tank . The actuator may have a connection rod which may connect to the transducer holder by a connection thread .

As shown in and the connection thread may be attached to a floating head . The floating head may have a pair of slider holes which may be used by a pair of slider pins connected to a rotation frame . The slider pins may allow the rotation frame to be slidably connected to the floating head . The slider pins may each have a slider cap threadably attached at a top end . The slider pins may further have a bottom end which may each have a hinge connected to the rotation frame . The rotation frame may have free rotation provided by the hinges around a first axis between the pair of slider pins . The rotation frame may further include a second pair of hinges which may connect to a transducer block . Thus the transducer block may have limited rotation provided by the hinges inside the rotation frame and around a second axis which may be perpendicular to the first axis . The rotation of the transducer block around the second axis is limited by the rotation frame .

The transducer block may further have at least one mount for at least one transducer . Each transducer may transmit sound waves through the transducer block through a body of water or other suitable medium and into the material or equipment being scanned.

The underside of the transducer block may have a plurality of feet as shown in . The feet may keep the transducer block from coming into direct contact with the material or equipment being scanned such as the airfoil . In one embodiment there are three such feet disposed on the underside of the transducer block . The tree feet define a plane which may provide a stable base for the transducer block when placed onto a surface such as a surface of the airfoil . While three such feet are shown this is only exemplary and any number or shape of feet may be employed.

In operation the floating head may be positioned above the surface of the airfoil such that the feet are in contact with the surface . As the transducer holder is moved across the surface by the actuator the sliding pins may allow the transducer block to move up and down with the contour of the airfoil without the need to raise or lower the floating head . The rotational hinges and may allow the transducer block to rotate to the same incline as the surface as the transducer holder moves. Thus with such rotational and vertical freedom the transducer holder may be moved across the surface of the airfoil with the feet remaining on the surface thereby allowing the waterpath between the transducers and the surface to remain constant.

The actuator may be controlled through a computer by an operator manipulating a joystick. The joystick may give the operator control of the actuator s three axis motion. Alternatively the actuator may be controlled by a software program programmed to follow the contours of the airfoil and run on the computer.

In one embodiment shown in the transducer mounts may be oriented such that when the transducers are mounted one in each transducer mount the sound wave is reflected off of a smooth finished surface at a known calculated angle. The sound wave may be reflected into the surface . The known angle may allow for increased accuracy when interpreting the data collected by the transducers and displayed by the computer.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the technology disclosed herein has industrial applicability in a variety of settings such as but not limited to ultrasonic testing of new and in service equipment and materials. Specifically the testing of airfoils for use in aircraft is particularly advantageous. The present disclosure may allow the testing of airfoils and other parts with shapes or contours which were previously not possible with prior art testing apparatus. Moreover the accuracy of the tests is increased by allowing a set of transducers to follow the contour of the airfoil thereby allowing the transducers to maintain a constant waterpath.

The transducer block is placed in contact with the surface of the airfoil. When the transducer holder moves over the surface of the airfoil the holder is able to rotate in two directions as well as rise and fall with the contours of the surface to stay in constant contact with the surface of the airfoil. Thus a constant waterpath between the transducers and the surface of the airfoil is maintained allowing for more accurate data to be collected by the transducers as well as allowing for testing airfoils with more complicated geometry.
