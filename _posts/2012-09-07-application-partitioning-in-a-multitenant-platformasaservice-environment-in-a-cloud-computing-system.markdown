The embodiments of the invention relate generally to platform as a service PaaS environments and more specifically relate to a mechanism for application partitioning in a multi tenant PaaS environment in a cloud computing system.

Cloud computing is a computing paradigm in which a customer pays a cloud provider to execute a program on computer hardware owned and or controlled by the cloud provider. It is common for cloud providers to make virtual machines hosted on its computer hardware available to customers for this purpose. The cloud provider typically provides an interface that a customer can use to requisition virtual machines and associated resources such as processors storage and network services etc. as well as an interface a customer can use to install and execute the customer s program on the virtual machines that the customer requisitions together with additional software on which the customer s program depends. For some such programs this additional software can include software components such as a kernel and an operating system. Customers that have installed and are executing their programs in the cloud typically communicate with the executing program from remote geographic locations using Internet protocols.

For programs that are web applications the additional software can further include such software components as middleware and a framework. Web applications are programs that receive and act on requests in web or other Internet protocols such as HTTP. It is common for a user to use a web application by using a browser executing on the user s client computer system to send requests in a web protocol via the Internet to a server computer system on which the web application is executing. It is also common for automatic user agents to interact with web applications in web protocols in the same fashion.

While many web applications are suitable for execution in the cloud it often requires significant expertise and effort in order to install execute and manage a web application in the cloud. For example an administrator typically identifies all of the software components that a web application needs in order to execute and what versions of those software components are acceptable. In addition the administrator typically should obtain install and appropriately configure each such software component as well as the application itself. Where this high level of expertise and effort has been invested in order to get a web application running on a particular hypervisor and in a particular provider s cloud a similarly high level of expertise and effort usually should be subsequently invested to execute the web application instead or in addition on a different hypervisor and or in a different particular provider s cloud. Also it can be difficult to obtain useful information about how the application is performing and otherwise behaving when executing in the cloud.

Accordingly software and or hardware facilities for facilitating the execution of web applications in the cloud have been introduced and are known as Platform as a Service PaaS offerings. PaaS offerings typically facilitate deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software and provisioning hosting capabilities providing all of the facilities required to support the complete life cycle of building and delivering web application and service entirely available from the Internet. Typically these facilities operate as one or more virtual machines VMs running on top of a hypervisor in a host server.

Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for application partitioning in a multi tenant Platform as a Service PaaS environment in a cloud computing system. A method of embodiments of the invention includes receiving by a virtual machine VM a request to initialize a container on the VM the container comprising a resource constrained space of the VM to execute functionality of an application of a multi tenant PaaS system. The method also includes assigning a user identification UID and non volatile resources to the container wherein the UID and non volatile resources are part of a subset of UIDs and a subset of non volatile resources allotted to the VM from a range of UIDs and a range of non volatile resources associated with a district of the VM and wherein other VMs in the district are not allotted the same subset of UIDs from the range of UIDs or the same subset of non volatile resources from the range of non volatile resources.

In the following description numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as sending receiving attaching forwarding caching executing applying identifying configuring establishing or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a machine readable storage medium such as but not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions each coupled to a computer system bus.

The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear as set forth in the description below. In addition the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.

The present invention may be provided as a computer program product or software that may include a machine readable medium having stored thereon instructions which may be used to program a computer system or other electronic devices to perform a process according to the present invention. A machine readable medium includes any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer . For example a machine readable e.g. computer readable medium includes a machine e.g. a computer readable storage medium e.g. read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices etc. etc.

Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for application partitioning in a multi tenant PaaS environment in a cloud computing system. In the multi tenant PaaS environment a node i.e. virtual machine VM in the PaaS environment runs multiple applications and as such shares its resources between these applications. To enable this resource sharing the applications may be partitioned over multiple nodes in the PaaS system.

An application in a multi tenant PaaS system of embodiments may utilize several cartridges to provide the functionality of the application. These cartridges are run in containers which are a resource constrained process space within a node. Accordingly an application may be executed utilizing multiple containers spread among multiple nodes of the PaaS system. In some embodiments nodes in a PaaS system are assigned to a district. Each district is assigned a set of resources e.g. user identifications UIDs security labels IP addresses ports etc. that are unique within the district and distributed to the containers within a district. As a result migration of containers of an application within a district but between VMs can be accomplished without creating security labeling conflicts or other resources conflicts for the container.

Clients and are connected to hosts and the cloud provider system via a network which may be a private network e.g. a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN intranet or other similar private networks or a public network e.g. the Internet . Each client may be a mobile device a PDA a laptop a desktop computer or any other computing device. Each host may be a server computer system a desktop computer or any other computing device. The cloud provider system may include one or more machines such as server computers desktop computers etc.

In one embodiment the cloud provider system is coupled to a cloud controller via the network . The cloud controller may reside on one or more machines e.g. server computers desktop computers etc. and may manage the execution of applications in the cloud . In some embodiments cloud controller receives commands from PaaS provider controller . Based on these commands the cloud controller provides data e.g. such as pre generated images associated with different applications to the cloud provider system . In some embodiments the data may be provided to the cloud provider and stored in an image repository in an image repository not shown located on each host or in an image repository not shown located on each VM .

Upon receiving a command identifying specific data e.g. application data and files used to initialize an application on the cloud the cloud provider retrieves the corresponding data from the image repository creates an instance of it and loads it to the host to run on top of a hypervisor not shown as a VM or within a VM . In addition a command may identify specific data to be executed on one or more of the VMs . The command may be received from the cloud controller from a PaaS Provider Controller or a user e.g. a system administrator via a console computer or a client machine. The image repository may be local or remote and may represent a single data structure or multiple data structures databases repositories files etc. residing on one or more mass storage devices such as magnetic or optical storage based disks solid state drives SSDs or hard drives.

In one embodiment PaaS provider controller includes a resource control module configured to control resources of a multi tenant PaaS system implemented in cloud . The resource control module may manage resources and the distribution of resources to VMs implementing the multi tenant PaaS system. The resources are utilized by VMs to implement components of applications executed in the multi tenant PaaS system.

While various embodiments are described in terms of the environment described above those skilled in the art will appreciate that the facility may be implemented in a variety of other environments including a single monolithic computer system as well as various other combinations of computer systems or similar devices connected in various ways.

In one embodiment the client layer resides on a client machine such as a workstation of a software developer and provides an interface to a user of the client machine to a broker layer of the PaaS system . For example the broker layer may facilitate the creation and deployment on the cloud via node layer of software applications being developed by an end user at client layer .

In one embodiment the client layer includes a source code management system sometimes referred to as SCM or revision control system. One example of such an SCM or revision control system is Git available as open source software. Git and other such distributed SCM systems usually include a working directory for making changes and a local software repository for storing the changes. The packaged software application can then be pushed from the local Git repository to a remote Git repository. From the remote repository the code may be edited by others with access or the application may be executed by a machine. Other SCM systems work in a similar manner.

The client layer in one embodiment also includes a set of command tools that a user can utilize to create launch and manage applications. In one embodiment the command tools can be downloaded and installed on the user s client machine and can be accessed via a command line interface or a graphical user interface or some other type of interface. In one embodiment the command tools expose an application programming interface API of the broker layer and perform other applications management tasks in an automated fashion using other interfaces as will be described in more detail further below in accordance with some embodiments.

In one embodiment the broker layer acts as middleware between the client layer and the node layer . The node layer includes the nodes on which software applications are provisioned and executed. In one embodiment each node is a VM provisioned by an Infrastructure as a Service IaaS provider such as Amazon Web Services. In other embodiments the nodes may be physical machines or VMs residing on a single physical machine. In one embodiment the broker layer is implemented on one or more machines such as server computers desktop computers etc. In some embodiments the broker layer may be implemented on one or more machines separate from machines implementing each of the client layer and the node layer or may implemented together with the client layer and or the node layer on one or more machines or some combination of the above.

In one embodiment the broker layer includes a broker that coordinates requests from the client layer with actions to be performed at the node layer . One such request is new application creation. In one embodiment when a user using the command tools at client layer requests the creation of a new application or some other action to manage the application the broker first authenticates the user using an authentication service . In one embodiment the authentication service may comprise Streamline or may comprise some other authentication tool. Once the user has been authenticated and allowed access to the system by authentication service the broker uses a server orchestration system to collect information and configuration information about the nodes .

In one embodiment the broker uses the Marionette Collective MCollective framework available from Puppet Labs as the server orchestration system but other server orchestration systems may also be used. The server orchestration system in one embodiment functions to coordinate server client interaction between multiple sometimes a large number of servers. In one embodiment the servers being orchestrated are nodes which are acting as application servers and web servers.

For example if the broker wanted to shut down all applications on all even numbered nodes out of 100 000 nodes the broker would only need to provide one command to the server orchestration system . Then the server orchestration system would generate and distribute a message to all nodes to shut down all applications if the node is even using a messaging and queuing system. Thus in one embodiment the broker manages the business logic and model representing the nodes and the applications residing on the nodes and acts as a controller that generates the actions requested by users via an API of the client tools . The server orchestration system then takes those actions generated by the broker and orchestrates their execution on the many nodes managed by the system.

In one embodiment the information collected about the nodes can be stored in a data store . In one embodiment the data store can be a locally hosted database or file store or it can be a cloud based storage service provided by a Software as a Service SaaS provider such as Amazon S3 Simple Storage Service . The broker uses the information about the nodes and their applications to model the application hosting service and to maintain records about the nodes. In one embodiment node data is stored in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation JSON blob or string that maintains key value pairs to associate a unique identifier a hostname a list of applications and other such attributes with the node.

In embodiments of the invention the PaaS system architecture of is a multi tenant PaaS environment. In a multi tenant PaaS environment each node runs multiple applications or portions of applications that may be owned or managed by different users and or organizations. As such a first customer s deployed applications may co exist with any other customer s deployed applications on the same node VM that is hosting the first customer s deployed applications . This deployment of multiple applications of multiple customers on a single node VM is a cost efficient solution for PaaS providers. However deploying a multi tenant PaaS solution raises a variety of concerns including for example efficient resource sharing on the node s limited resources between the applications hosted on the node and security between the applications hosted on the node .

Embodiments of the invention provide a resource control module in server orchestration system for resource distribution between applications hosted on a multi tenant node . In one embodiment resource control module is the same as resource control module described with respect to . The resource control module manages resource distribution to applications of the multi tenant PaaS system by setting up each node to share a set of non volatile resources that are available to any node in a district of the multi tenant PaaS system One embodiment of the interaction between the server orchestration system and a node to implement resource distribution for applications in districts of a multi tenant PaaS system is now described in more detail with reference to .

Each node also includes a server orchestration system agent configured to track and collect information about the node and to perform actions on the node . Thus in one embodiment using MCollective as the server orchestration system the server orchestration system agent can act as a MCollective server. The server orchestration system would then act as the MCollective client that can send requests queries and commands to the MCollective server on node .

In one embodiment an application may utilize one or more cartridge instances that are run in one or more resource constrained containers on nodes . A container is a resource constrained process space on the node to execute functionality of an application. In some embodiments a container is established by the node with resource boundaries including a limit and or designation of the amount of memory amount of storage and security types and or labels to be applied to any functions executed by the container . In one embodiment containers may be established using the Linux Containers LXC virtualization method. In further embodiments containers may also be established using cgroups SELinux and kernel namespaces to name a few examples.

In some embodiments a container may also be known as a gear. In some embodiments cartridges instances for an application may execute in containers dispersed over more than one node as shown with application illustrated in . In other embodiments cartridge instances for an application may run in one or more containers on the same node as shown with application in .

Cartridge library provides an OS based location outside of application containers that acts as a source for cartridge instantiations that provide functionality e.g. support software for an application . An application may use more than one cartridge instance as part of providing functionality for the application . One example of this is a JavaEE application that uses a JBoss AS7 cartridge with a supporting MySQL database provided by a MySQL cartridge. Each cartridge instance may include a software repository that provides the particular functionality of the cartridge instance . Although depicts just one cartridge instance with a repository it should be appreciated that each cartridge instance of includes a repository even if not shown.

In one embodiment the server orchestration system broker includes a resource control module that manages resource distribution to nodes in the multi tenant PaaS system. The resource control module manages placement of containers executing application functionality among nodes . Furthermore the resource control module also controls distribution of district level resources to be shared among nodes and thereby containers for purposes of executing multi tenant application on nodes as discussed further below with respect to .

In one embodiment nodes of the multi tenant PaaS system are grouped into districts . Although only two districts are illustrated one skilled in the art will appreciate that server orchestration system may manage multiple more than two districts within a PaaS system. In one embodiment a district is a collection of nodes that is given a dedicated set of non volatile resources. The non volatile resources may include but are not limited to User Identifications UIDs Internet Protocol IP addresses ports and security labels such as SELinux security labels to share.

In embodiments of the invention each container in a district is then assigned unique resources from the district level allotment of resources. As such in embodiments of the invention no two containers executing on any nodes in a same district should conflict with each other in terms of district level non volatile resources such as UIDs IP address ports and or security labels. In some embodiments the resource control module is responsible for configuring resource assignments for each container in each district .

Each district includes a maximum total number of containers that can be provisioned in the district . For instance if a district limits a finite resource for the application that must be unique across the district such as the numbers of ports that can be utilized that resource in turn limits the total number of applications in the district. As such in this embodiment the district is limited to 6 000 containers in order to avoid conflicts between containers in a district .

In addition as mentioned previously due to the district configuration of nodes a container migrated within a district does not have to change configurations of its district assigned non volatile resources such as its internal UIDs IP address es ports or security labeling for example. However if a container is migrated outside of its source district then potential district level resource conflicts can occur e.g. conflicting security labels which results in further processing for the migration.

In one embodiment server orchestration system agent interacts with OS to manage resources for multi tenant applications that are executed wholly or in part by one or more containers on node . In one embodiment resource control module manages resources by assigning application components such as containers and their associated cartridges to nodes in the multi tenant PaaS system in a manner that efficiently distributes processing of the application components in terms of resource and capacity utilization as well as efficiency and responsiveness.

In one embodiment a node is assigned a range of security labels for the node to assign out. The resource control module provides this range of security labels to the node . In one embodiment the range of security labels assigned to node is a subset of a set of unique security labels allotted to a district that the node is assigned. In one embodiment a security category labeling SCL feature of the OS is utilized to provide security and separation for each container executed on the node from all other containers executed in the district of the node. An SCL is a security enhancement to an OS such as OS that allows users to label files with categories. These categories may then be used to constrain the file and any processes that are trying to access the file.

In one embodiment a security category labeling is implemented using a Multi Category Security MCS feature of SELinux . SELinux is a security architecture integrated into the Linux OS kernel. SELinux provides a flexible Mandatory Access Control MAC system built into the Linux kernel. MCS is an enhancement to SELinux and allows users to label files with categories. Other security category labeling features from other OS vendors may also be utilized in embodiments of the invention as well.

In one embodiment a SCL module of OS generates unique SCLs to be assigned to applications of node based on unique local user IDs UID maintained by OS . OS maintains a set of unique local UIDs that are assigned to containers as they are installed on the node . In one embodiment the set of unique local UIDs are part of a larger set of unique UIDs used in a district of the node . In one embodiment SCL module generates a set of unique SCLs by applying a transform to each unique local UID maintained by OS . In order to maintain a unique set of SCLs for a district the transform that is applied by SCL module should be uniformly used by all nodes in a district. In one embodiment the generation of an SCL for each unique local UID of the node is performed prior to any containers being initialized on the node .

The mapping of local UID to SCL may be stored in UID SCL datastore of OS . In one embodiment node maintains a range of local UIDs e.g. from 500 to 1500 provided to node by the resource control module where the local UIDs are a subset of a larger unique set of UIDs for a district of nodes . The node assigns one of the local UIDs to containers as they are created on node . Prior to any containers starting on node SCL module assigns a unique SCL to each UID in the range. In some embodiments a transform is applied to each local UID to generate the SCL for that UID. For example UID 500 is turned into SCL S0 C0 C1 and UID 501 is turned into SCL S0 C0 C2 UID 502 is turned into SCL S0 C0 C3 and so on.

In a further embodiment after the unique SCLs are generated and mapped to their associated local UIDs by SCL module resource control module may interact with server orchestration system agent to pre configure Internet Protocol IP addresses and ports assigned to the node . As part of the initial configuration of node the node is assigned a set of IP addresses and ports to be utilized by processes e.g. containers of the node . For example a whole class A set of IP addresses may be utilized by node which potentially results in the order of 16 million IP addresses assigned to node . Similarly a large range of ports may also be assigned to the node for customized use by a container e.g. ephemeral or custom ports of the node . In one embodiment this set of IP addresses and ports is part of a larger range of IP addresses and ports that are unique across all nodes in a district. In other words each node in a district is not assigned the same range of IP addresses or the same range of ports as any other node in the same district.

Node may then associate subsets of the assigned IP addresses and ports of the node to each local UID maintained by the node. In one embodiment each local UID is assigned a class C network of IP addresses from the class A set of IP addresses which results in around 250 IP addresses. In addition each local UID may be assigned a number of ephemeral or custom ports e.g. 5 from the ports assigned to the node . IP address datastore and port configuration data store may be used by OS to keep a record of the existing IP addresses and ports for the node as well as a mapping between IP addresses UIDs and ports UIDs.

In one embodiment SCL module then accesses IP address datastore and port configuration data store to pre label IP addresses and ports with SCLs. SCL module may utilize the UID SCL datastore to match SCLs associated with a UID to the IP addresses and ports for the same UID found in IP address datastore and in the port configuration datastore . In one embodiment each of the IP address datastore and the port configuration datastore keep a record of the SCL label applied to each IP address and to each port. In some embodiments pre configuring the IP addresses and ports with SCLs associated with the UID assigned to the IP addresses and ports prior to initialization of container on the node can save time in the configuration process of the container itself. In other embodiments the IP addresses and ports may be associated with SCLs of the container when the container is initialized on the node .

In some embodiments when a container is initialized on node it is assigned a unique local UID as discussed above. Then in one embodiment SCL module accesses the home directory of the container and assigns the unique SCL to all resources found in the home directory. In one embodiment a change context CHCON command may be used to change labels on the files listed in the home directory associated with the UID i.e. associated with the application . When the container begins running on node SCL module associates the unique SCL associated with the local UID of the application to the running process of the application so that the process is run with the SCL. Once the application is running the IP addresses associated with the local UID of the application may then be utilized as they were already pre configured to be associated with the UID and will already have the associated SCLs assigned.

Utilizing the unique SCL assigned to the combination of the running process of the application the files of the application and the IP addresses and ports of the container the SCL module may then enforce permissions to access these resources of container . The SCL label is used by SCL module to keep containers separated from each other both on the node and within the district of the node . For example SCL module ensures that the SCL of a requesting process matches the SCL of any resources e.g. files and or IP addresses that it is requesting to access. If the SCLs do not match the SCL module denies permission to the requesting process. In some embodiments each SCL provides a same level of security for each container but prevents container from accesses resources of other container .

One skilled in the art will appreciate that non volatile resources other than UIDs security labels IP addresses and ports may be uniquely assigned to nodes in a district and thereby to the containers executed in the nodes . Embodiments of the invention are not solely limited to the above described non volatile resources.

Method begins at block where a range of unique UIDs are generated for use by a plurality of nodes in a district of the multi tenant PaaS system. In one embodiment a district of the multi tenant PaaS system is a collection of nodes of the PaaS system that are associated for purposes of resource allotment. At block a range of IP addressed for use by the nodes in the district is identified. At block a range of ports for use by the nodes in the district is also identified. In some embodiments the resource control module may associate the UIDs to IP addresses and ports while in other embodiments the node may handle this association process.

Then at block a request to initialize a new node in the district is received. In one embodiment the request is received from a component of the server orchestration system operating on a broker layer of the multi tenant PaaS system. The new node may be requested to address capacity and utilization concerns of the multi tenant PaaS system. At block a subset of each of the ranges of unique UIDs IP addresses and port for the district that have not been allotted to any nodes in the district are identified.

At block the new node for the district is configured with the identified subsets of unique UIDs IP addresses and ports for the node. Furthermore the new node is configured with a transform for the node to apply to the UIDs when generating SCLs for containers executed by the node. This uniform transform among nodes of a district results in a unique range of SCLs generated for a district without any overlapping of SCLs in the district. Lastly at block the new node is initialized in the district with the district level resource configurations for its non volatile resources.

Method begins at block where a range of unique SCLs are generated for each unique local UID maintained by the node of the PaaS system. The unique local UID may be provided by a resource control module of the multi tenant PaaS system as one of a range of UIDs allotted for a district of the node. In one embodiment a transform is applied to each local UID to generate the unique SCL for that UID. This transform may be the same transform that is applied by all nodes in the district of the node. A mapping between UIDs and SCLs may then be maintained by a datastore in the OS.

At block for each unique UID the SCL for that UID is associated with one or more IP addresses mapped to the UID and to one or more ports mapped to the UID. In one embodiment the IP addresses and ports are provided to the node as subsets of a larger set of IP addresses and ports used within the district of the node. A mapping of IP addresses to UIDs may be utilized to match SCLs to IP addresses. This mapping of IP addresses to SCLs may then be maintained in an IP address datastore of the OS of the node. Similarly a mapping of ports to UIDs may be utilized to match SCLs to ports. This mapping of ports to SCLS may then be maintained in a port configuration datastore of the OS of the node.

Then at block a request to initialize a container on the node is received. In one embodiment the request is received from a server orchestration system operating on a broker layer of the PaaS system. The container is a resource constrained space of the node that is used to execute functionality e.g. cartridges of a multi tenant application of the PaaS system. In some embodiments an application s functionality may be spread amongst multiple containers and districts in the multi tenant PaaS system with different application containers co existing on a same node in the multi tenant PaaS system.

Subsequently at block a unique local UID of the local UIDs maintained by the node is assigned to the container. At block files of the container found in a home directory of the UID of the container are labeled with the SCL of the UID. Then at block when the container starts running the SCL of the UID of the container is assigned to the running process of the container. In one embodiment a SCL module of the OS such as SCL module of may coordinate method on the node.

It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as segmenting analyzing determining enabling identifying modifying or the like refer to the actions and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium such as but not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus the appearances of the phrase in one embodiment or in an embodiment in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. In addition the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or. 

It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. The scope of the invention should therefore be determined with reference to the appended claims along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
