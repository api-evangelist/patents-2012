title: Nozzled mortar ignition system for improved performance
abstract: A mortar system includes a launch unit that comprises a mortar ignition cartridge provided with a flashtube. The flashtube incorporates a ring-like nozzle that is positioned within the flashtube, which acts to restrain the motion of the black powder pellets as well as to choke the flow of the resultant combustion products. The nozzle separates the flashtube into two compartments: a flashtube venting chamber and a pellet combustion chamber. The mortar ignition cartridge combustion chamber acts as the product-gas venting area of the flashtube. The combustion of the black powder pellets essentially takes place in the pellet combustion chamber. The present design modification improves the overall performance of the mortar system.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates in general to the field of devices for launching mortar projectiles. Particularly the present invention relates to a flashtube in a launch unit of the mortar. More specifically a nozzle divides the flashtube into two compartments a flashtube venting chamber and a pellet combustion chamber in order to improve the performance of the mortar.

The reliable performance of a propellant driven munition system is dependent on the performance of its propulsion unit. The ignition train has historically been the weakest link in the repeatability of the munition system. Coupling the initiation of the ballistic cycle through various intermediate steps until a smooth transition to full combustion is achieved is the key to reliability.

In a mortar system the mortar propulsion system is initiated by either an electric or a percussion element in the primer head which in turn ignites a black powder pellet s igniter in the base of the flashtube. The combustion products including gases are then vented through flash holes in the flashtube igniting the propellant in the mortar ignition cartridge. The combustion products in the mortar ignition cartridge then vent through holes in the mortar boom. Gas pressure from the combustion products starts the motion of the mortar projectile through the launch tube and the pressure and temperature of the products ignites any additional propellant increments attached to the boom.

Dynamic and hydrodynamic processes occur during the ignition and combustion phase of the launch. The black powder pellet is seated on a small shoulder at the base of the flashtube. Once the black powder pellet starts to be consumed by the combustion process its diameter starts to reduce and it becomes free to travel within the flashtube driven by local pressure gradients.

Thus the black powder pellet becomes free to oscillate within the flashtube covering and uncovering flash holes in the flashtube and creating pressure oscillations within the mortar ignition cartridge. As combustion is driven by the local pressure that the propellant experiences the oscillations within the flashtube can generate pressure waves within the mortar ignition cartridge which can propagate even further into the main combustion chamber.

Since pressure is the driving force of the flashtube venting it can cause the steel pin end of the flashtube to more vigorously initiate local combustion. This can cause further pressure waves within the mortar ignition cartridge which can be transferred to the combustion in the launch tube.

At low zones of propelling charge which has the lowest loading density of propellant in the mortar system the effect of the waves may be minimal. At higher zones and loading densities the pressure waves can cause erratic performance and in the most severe instances break fins off the mortar boom. This in turn causes an inaccurate trajectory and at worst a safety problem.

As a result present mortar systems can have severe pressure waves in the flashtube that transfer and grow in the mortar ignition cartridge and the launch tube.

What is therefore needed is a nozzle for use in the flashtube of the mortar launch unit in order to improve the performance of the mortar. The nozzle should create more homogeneous combustion among the black powder pellet s in the flashtube. The nozzle should result in a decrease in the variation in terms of mass flow rate of venting products from the flashtube vent holes. The nozzle should create a more consistent muzzle velocity of the mortar. The nozzle should result in a decrease in pressure waves within the flashtube and therefore within the mortar ignition cartridge. Prior to the advent of the present invention the need for such a nozzle has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and describes a nozzle in a launch unit of a mortar system where the launch unit has a propellant charge capable of generating propellant gas for launching the projectile from a barrel of the mortar.

It is an object of the present nozzle to create more stable and complete combustion among the black powder pellet s in the flashtube over the burn time of these pellet s .

It is another object of the present nozzle to result in a decrease in the variation in terms of mass flow rate of venting products from the flashtube vent holes.

It is still another object of the present nozzle to result in a decrease in pressure waves within the flashtube and therefore within the mortar ignition cartridge.

It is yet another object of the present nozzle to create a more consistent muzzle velocity of the mortar.

These and other objects of the present invention are realized by a mortar system that includes a launch unit and a projectile that are threaded together. The launch unit comprises a mortar ignition cartridge that includes a flashtube which in turn incorporates a nozzle that is made and positioned within the flashtube according to the teaching of the present invention.

The nozzle is inserted within the flashtube so that it sits on a shoulder which prevents the nozzle from sliding further into the flashtube. The nozzle separates the flashtube into two compartments a flashtube venting chamber and a pellet combustion chamber. The flashtube venting chamber acts as the product gas forming area of the flashtube.

The combustion of the black powder pellets takes place in the pellet combustion chamber because the nozzle acts as a hard stop which keeps the solid phase of the propellant from combusting upstream. The flow of combustion products will be choked by the nozzle which prevents upstream pressure oscillations from traveling back into the combustion area due to the nature of compressible flow.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to it illustrates a mortar system also referred to herein as a mortar bomb or a mortar that includes a launch unit and a projectile that are connected with threads. The projectile may be any suitable projectile that is either known or available in the field and therefore its construction will not be discussed herein in detail.

With further reference to the launch unit comprises a mortar ignition cartridge that includes a flashtube which in turn incorporates a ring like circular nozzle according to the present invention.

When the projectile is dropped into a muzzle of a mortar tube the ignition train is started through the action of a percussion primer striking a firing pin . The gases and hot solid salts evolved by the percussion primer initiate a couple of centrally perforated black powder pellets . Through shock and solid impact by the percussion primer combustion products the pellets break up and combust. These black powder pellets are contained within a pellet combustion chamber of the flashtube where the product gases and small solid particles can leave through a series of radial vent holes that are positioned axially relative to the flashtube . The vent holes are evenly spaced about the circumference of the flashtube .

When the combustion gases exit the flashtube they impinge on and ignite a bed of solid granular propellant bed contained within a mortar ignition cartridge combustion chamber of the mortar ignition cartridge which may in turn ignite several additional charge rounds. The upstream end of the flashtube is sealed in this case with a steel pin so that the combustion gases exit only though the radial vent holes .

The uniformity of ignition of the solid granular propellant bed including optional charge rounds is critical for the formation of propelling gases that move the mortar system consistently. Critically the formation of high pressure gradients will have the effect of reducing repeatability and in turn accuracy of the weapon system.

Pressure gradients in the flashtube are caused by a variety of factors. The combustion of the black powder pellets is subject to non uniform ignition mechanical break up and resulting movement of the pellets . There is also a complex shock interaction inside the flashtube . The initial burning sets up a pressure wave which travels down the flashtube and eventually reflects back towards the burning grains. There will be a normal shock at some length down the flashtube whose location will be affected by instantaneous flow characteristics friction and mass loss down the length of the flashtube through the vent holes .

The problem with the combustion of the black powder pellets in the absence of the nozzle is that it tends to be a highly unrepeatable event due to its hydroscopic nature loose tolerances in chemical composition and brittleness. In addition such mortar system would suffer from the propagation of pressure waves in the flashtube that transfer to the mortar ignition cartridge and the flashtube venting chamber .

With further reference to the present invention addresses this problem by integrating the nozzle above the black powder pellets or any other igniter in a primer head above the igniter creating a pellet combustion chamber . The newly created pellet combustion chamber gives more reproducible combustion of the igniter a more isochronic ignition pulse through the flash holes a smoother combustion of the propellant bed in the mortar ignition cartridge and fewer waves traveling from the combustion chamber into the flashtube venting chamber .

To this end the nozzle is inserted within the flashtube so it seats on a shoulder of the flashtube which acts as a stop to prevent the nozzle from sliding further within the flashtube . As a result the nozzle separates the flashtube into two compartments the flashtube compartment and the pellet combustion chamber . The sizes and lengths of the various components would be defined by the specific mortar system that is in use and its ignition system. The pellet combustion chamber acts as the product gas evolution area for the flashtube .

The combustion of the black powder pellets essentially takes place in the pellet combustion chamber because the nozzle keeps the black powder pellets from moving into the flashtube venting chamber . The present flashtube can be used as a replacement of or in conjunction with conventional flashtubes with no further modifications to the mortar system .

The present flashtube produces even burning and leaves less solid unburned particulate matter before the combustion products enter the launch tube pellet combustion chamber of the flashtube . In one exemplary embodiment five black powder pellets were retained held in place by a small shoulder . During pellet combustion and without the insertion of the nozzle the black powder pellets break up and large pieces easily travel down the length of the flashtube to the launch tube pellet combustion chamber . By placing the nozzle against the shoulder the combustion is enhanced in several ways.

The choked flow of the combustion products at the end of the combustion chamber acts as a quasi solid boundary to upstream pressure disturbances in that it acts as a solid boundary to fluids without actually being solid. Pressure waves reflecting off the end of the flashtube which would otherwise feed back into the pellet combustion chamber are significantly reduced if not entirely eliminated. The choked flow acts to damp out the affect of pressure wave interaction with the combustion of the black powder pellets .

The choked flow results in a higher pressure within the pellet combustion chamber than without the nozzle . This high combustion pressure feeds back to increase the rate of the propellant consumption thus decreasing the likelihood of uncombusted propellant fragments escaping the pellet combustion chamber .

With further reference to and the nozzle is generally cylindrically shaped with a central orifice formed in its center. According to an exemplary embodiment the nozzle throat diameter is sized according to compressible flow relations wherein the outer diameter of the nozzle is approximately equal to the inner diameter of the pellet combustion chamber end of the flashtube . The nozzle is preferably made of an integral piece of metal. It should however be understood that the nozzle can be made from any non flammable heat resistant materials such as metals and ceramics.

Also the physical barrier presented by the central orifice of the nozzle keeps larger propellant fragments constrained in the pellet combustion chamber and out of the launch tube combustion chamber . The confined pellet combustion chamber creates an essentially isochoric pellet combustion chamber that enhances mixing of hot propellant gases and therefore increases the amount of propellant allowed to go to complete combustion. An additional benefit is that more complete propellant combustion in the pellet combustion chamber will require fewer black powder pellets to transfer the same amount of energy to the propellant bed .

Furthermore burning the black powder pellets at higher pressure and temperature more completely will mitigate the effects of its hygroscopicity. The black powder pellets absorb moisture as a function of processing methods and environmental exposure. The degree of absorption of individual pellets in the mortar system is unknown before firing. Water in the black powder pellets acts to decrease the total energy released during the reaction. Also more energy is released from the black powder pellets themselves as new reaction pathways open at higher temperatures created in the pellet combustion chamber .

The nozzle provides additional advantages among which are the following The nozzle creates the separate pellet combustion chamber for the black powder pellets for more reproducible combustion. It alleviates large variations in flashtube performance due to the hygroscopicity of the black powder pellets within the pellet combustion chamber . The nozzle also changes the point of choked flow from the vent holes in the flashtube to the nozzle yielding more uniform flow through the flash holes . The nozzle further decreases the pressure gradient within the flashtube leading to a more isochronic ignition of the ignition cartridge propellant bed .

Although the present flashtube has been described in connection with an exemplary mortar system it should be clear that the flashtube is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein. It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present flashtube without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
