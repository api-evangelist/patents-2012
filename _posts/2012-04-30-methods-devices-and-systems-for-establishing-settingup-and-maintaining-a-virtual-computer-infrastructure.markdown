This application claims priority to co pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 480 294 entitled METHODS DEVICES AND SYSTEMS FOR ESTABLISHING SETTING UP AND MAINTAINING A VIRTUAL COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE filed on Apr. 28 2011 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Computing systems these days have significantly more processing capabilities that traditionally have existed in the past and each single server is capable of supporting more users than ever before. Historically and technically speaking servers have a configuration of a physical computer i.e. computer hardware on which an operating system resides where the operating system is used to interface with the physical computer and manage applications that are utilized by users of the server.

As a result of the power of today s servers it has become fairly common that servers within an organization operate with five percent 5 utilization when configured with an historic configuration i.e. operating system and applications operating on a physical computer . Because of the low utilization of the servers rather than buying more servers hardware virtualization has developed where multiple virtual machines are established on a physical computer and the virtual machines operating on the physical computer are managed thereon. These virtual machines may be created to operate applications and be configured to manage different groups of users for example as would be a physical computer. Conventional virtualization is deployed in a very similar manner as conventional software where downloaded software or computer disks are used to install the virtualization technology and supporting tools by an information technology IT professional and the IT professional manages the virtualization technology and supporting tools in a similar manner as managing other software applications.

Because of overhead requirements for hardware virtualization hardware virtualization has traditionally been utilized by large companies that can afford the overhead that comes with managing such a configuration. That is although multiple virtual machines can be operated on a single physical computer there are inherent management requirements that the company has to absorb in managing installed virtualization technologies virtual machines and the supporting tools where the management requirements include maintaining upgrading performing compliance management backing up and so forth as understood in the art. While multiple virtual servers may be placed onto a single physical computer a separate management system is utilized. For small companies hardware virtualization is generally a luxury that cannot be afforded despite benefits that are provided by hardware virtualization.

To provide companies both large and small with the ability to use hardware virtualization with lower overhead than conventional virtualization of servers the principles of the present invention provides for a web service based virtualization solution that allows customers to deploy and manage virtual servers. The virtualization solution allows for customers to significantly reduce the amount of overhead that typically comes with hardware virtualization as an operator of the virtualization solution may manage updates upgrades configuration management and so on of the virtualized environment.

The principles of the present invention may include two components 1 a remote virtualization distribution and management system hosted by a third party and 2 a boot key that i boots i.e. starts up an empty physical server ii network enables the empty physical server and iii connects the empty physical server with the remote virtualization distribution and management system.

One embodiment of a boot key may include an operating system configured to be executed by a computing system and a boot loader configured to cause the operating system to be loaded by the computing system during turn on of the computing system. A worker may be configured to work in conjunction with the operating system and be configured to cause the computing system to automatically communicate with a web service located on a communications network.

One method of operating an electronic device may include loading an operating system from a boot key on the electronic device during turn on of the electronic device. The operating system may be operated on the electronic device. The boot key may cause the electronic device to automatically communicate with a web service located on a communications network to enable executable instructions from the web service to be communicated to the electronic device for execution thereon.

One method of a system for establishing and managing virtual servers on multiple host servers may include a storage unit configured to store a virtual server an input output I O unit configured to communicate over a communications network and a processing unit in communication with the storage unit and I O unit. The processing unit may be configured to process a command received from an administrator system of a customer via a communications network the command may include a request to download communicate a virtual server stored on the storage unit to a host server of a customer. The processing unit may further be configured to access the virtual server stored on the storage unit in response to processing the command and to communicate the virtual server via the I O unit and communications network to the host servers for execution thereon.

In one embodiment management system may act as a broker to facilitate the sale of capacity and or software programs on one or more virtual computer infrastructures for use by one or more users such as users A N and .

The processing unit may be in communication with a memory input output I O unit and storage unit . The memory may be configured to store data used by and or software executed by the processing unit . The I O unit may be configured to communicate commands and or data e.g. guest systems and virtualization environments via a network such as the Internet. The storage unit may be configured to store one or more data repositories collectively . The data repositories may be configured to store a variety of different data such as one or more different standard configurations of available guest systems. As another example the data repositories may store customized guest systems after a user or organization for example has customized a standard guest system for use in the organization . Data repositories may also be used to store complete or partial incremental backups of guest systems .

As shown the organization may utilize host systems . The host systems are physical computers on which virtual guest systems may be operated. As an example host system is executing guest systems collectively . The guest systems may be standard guest systems available from the virtualization web service . In being standard a guest system may be a guest system that is readily available to customers of the virtualization web service . Alternatively the guest systems may be customized guest systems or be a customized version of a standard guest system. A customized guest system or customized version of a standard guest system may be a standard guest system that is altered based on parameters that may be set by a service provider operating the virtualization web service or by the organization for example. In one embodiment the guest systems may be identical guest systems e.g. running identical operating systems with identical virtual machine configurations or different guest systems e.g. running different operating systems or with different virtual machine configurations .

In addition to the host systems the organization may also operate an administration system . The administrator system may provide a user with the ability to interface with the computing system of the virtualization web service to control and manage the host system and guest systems thereon. It should be understood that communicating with the virtualization web service inherently means to communicate with the computing system of the web service . In one embodiment the administrator system is a computing or communication system such as a desktop laptop web browser smart phone tablet or any other system that is capable of interfacing with a user interface such as a graphical user interface that provides for communication with the virtualization web service . Because the host system is typically a blank slate when configured with the guest systems the host system may be booted using a boot key not shown as further described herein. The administrator system may be used to control operations of selecting and deploying the guest systems onto the host system . In one embodiment and as further described herein a boot key not shown that is plugged into the host system may be utilized to cause the host system to communicate with the virtualization web service . From there the administrator system may be utilized to communicate with the virtualization web service to cause the guest systems to be downloaded and deployed on the host system

More specifically one or more commands may be communicated via network by the administrator system to the virtualization web service . In response to the commands via a graphical user interface e.g. website or otherwise the processing unit may access the data repositories and download one or more selected guest systems onto the host system . The administrator system may provide the user with the ability to configure the guest system s as guest system s as desired. The administrator system may also provide the user with the ability to monitor and manage guest systems and host systems

The data repositories may further be configured to store information associated with each of the organizations such as names addresses server addresses boot key IDs guest system information e.g. date downloaded current version current configuration etc. contact information user names and so forth. Because the virtualization web service may be configured to support multiple unrelated organizations the software may be configured to manage the data repositories in a partitioned manner to segregate information of each of the organizations.

As further shown in an administrator operating the administrator system may communicate commands with the virtualization web service . The virtualization web service is shown to include a number of different functions including status and health monitoring usage statistics logs provisioning command queue guest system repository latest boot key API management console branded portal billing and usage metering and virtualization environment . The commands may be communicated to the management console which may be configured to enable the administrator to manage an account including guest systems that may selectively deploy onto the host system via the network such as the Internet.

In one embodiment management console may be configured to enable administrator to download the latest boot key data to administrator system where the administrator system may write the latest boot key data to a bootable machine readable media such as a CD ROM or USB memory to create a boot key capable of automatically configuring the host system to operate and communicate with virtualization web service as further described in the following paragraph. It should be understood that boot key may be configured once to start and configure multiple host systems for operation and virtualization with no installation process or other interaction from the administrator .

The boot key may further store a worker that executes in conjunction with the operating system . The worker may be configured to automatically communicate with the API on the virtualization web service by having a logical address of the virtualization web service with which to communicate. The worker may communicate commands and data with the API to initiate and drive the virtualization setup process with the virtualization web service . The API may communicate with the latest boot key data to determine if the boot key is the latest version and if not cause the latest boot key data to be communicated to the worker for updating the boot key . The virtualization setup process is further described with regard to .

In this configuration the host system is shown to be configured with a virtualization environment and multiple guest systems or machines or servers collectively . It should be understood however that the host system may be configured with only a single guest system. The guest systems may be configured with virtual machines virtual hardware collectively operating systems collectively and one or more applications A and respectively. In one embodiment the virtual machines are identical. Alternatively the virtual machines may be different or be configured differently. In one embodiment the operating systems may be the same. Alternatively the operating systems may be different or be configured differently. As shown the guest system repository which may store a variety of pre configured guest systems may be accessed by the administrator utilizing the administrator system to cause a virtual machine i.e. data representative of a virtual machine to be communicated from the virtualization web service to the host system via the network . Virtualization web service may prior to communicating a requested guest system configure host system with a virtualization environment to make host system capable of operating virtual machines . A virtualization environment may be shared among multiple virtual machines .

The boot key is shown to be maintained in communication with host system . However it should be understood that the boot key or contents stored thereon e.g. operating system worker and boot loader may be installed onto the host system thereby enabling the host system to operate independently from the boot key after the initial setup.

It should be understood that the principles of the present invention may be performed on any electronic device capable of having a boot key be utilized for causing the electronic device such as a smart phone to communicate with a web service thereby allowing the electronic device be shipped from a manufacturer with little or no capabilities of its own as shipped i.e. a blank electronic device . By shipping the device as a blank and allowing the software e.g. operating system applications etc. to be installed by a web service manufacturer or third party as instructed by a boot key the cost of manufacturing can be significantly reduced for the manufacturer.

The boot key may include a unique identifier ID or boot key ID. The unique ID may identify a host system and or organization. Still yet the unique ID may identify a user. Alternatively the unique ID may be associated with a host system organization and or individual in a data repository e.g. database at the web service. The host system as directed by the worker of the boot key may communicate the unique ID to identify the host system. The web service may utilize the unique ID to identify which organization the unique ID belongs. In one embodiment the unique ID is communicated to the web service with every communication thereby enabling the web service to track each communication by a host system. In an alternative embodiment certain communications may include the unique ID such as initial startup of a host server.

At step a worker may be executed by the host system . At step host system may read network settings imprinted in the boot key code to determine if a static network configuration or a dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP should be utilized to enable networking. At step if a static network configuration is determined the process waits for the temporary boot IP number to be available on the network. At step networking of the host system may be enabled and configured. At step the upgrade process as described in is executed to verify that the boot key data programs are the latest version. After the upgrade process is run once the upgrade process may be started as a separate process to keep the software environment on host system up to date. Step is executed if the network is configured for static configuration and if so a new permanent IP number is requested from virtualization web service . Step is executed if the network is configured for static configuration virtualization web service sends an available IP number to host system . Step is executed if the network is configured for static configuration and if so on host system the temporary boot IP is replaced with the new IP number. At step the report process as described in is started as a separate process. At step the queue process as described in is started as a separate process.

At step the task selected by virtualization web service may be communicated to the host system . The communicated task may be a set of commands or binary data e.g. application . At step the task received from the virtualization web service may be executed on the host system . At step the process may be repeated. It should be understood that the process may be event driven or sequential based on polling . In terms of being event driven the boot key e.g. worker may cause a request to be communicated to the virtualization web service to request that pending command s for the host server with which the boot key is communicating be executed. Because the host server may have little or no virtualization management capabilities as the virtualization web service may be configured to handle the management of the virtual machines on the host server.

At step a check if an action is triggered may be made. The check may be active or passive such as being responsive to a selection of an action by a user. At step if no action is triggered the process may repeat. At step in response to an action being selected the administrator system may communicate the action to the virtualization web service . At step the action may be stored in a task queue on virtualization web service which may be executed by the virtualization web service in due course as described in . At step the process repeats.

At step in response to the user selectively triggering to launch the guest system a command may be communicated to the virtualization web service . At step in response to receiving the command the virtualization web service may save the command in a queue. At step the host system may check the virtualization web service . If the command in the queue is directed for the host system as opposed to another host system then the virtualization web service may communicate a queue item in this case a task to launch a guest system.

At step the host system may send a request to the virtualization web service to have the guest system communicated to the host system . At step the virtualization web service may communicate the requested guest system to the host system . At step the host system may start the guest system to execute. Once executing the guest system may perform conventional guest system operations. It should be understood that the process may be event driven or sequential based on polling .

The name parameter may include a name of a virtual machine or server that a user selects or that the system automatically assigns. The location parameter may list physical locations of physical computers on which the virtual machines are located. In one embodiment the location parameter may indicate whether the host system or the guest system is public accessible by any customer of the virtual machine service provider or private accessible only to a particular customer . The IP address parameter may list actual IP addresses of the physical computers and guest systems or list that the IP address is not available n a due to the server being off line unavailable to the user or otherwise.

The set of actions parameters may include a number of selectable actions via selectable icons collectively as shown. The selectable icons may include play arrow stop square selectable icons that causes the associated virtual machine to download from the remote virtualization system to the host system if not already downloaded and played. If the stop icon is displayed then the user knows that the virtual machine is operating and that selecting the stop icon will cause the virtual machine to stop on the host system. A reboot selectable icon may enable a user to instruct the host system to reboot the associated virtual machine. A rename selectable icon may enable the user to instruct the host system or virtualization system to rename the virtual machine. A backup selectable icon may enable the user to instruct the host system to transfer a snapshot copy of the guest system to the virtualization system for backup purposes.

Continuing with the selectable icons a download selectable icon may enable the user to cause the virtual machine to be downloaded to the administration system e.g. laptop to allow the user to view the virtual machine off line or otherwise. The download may be from the host system or virtualization system depending on the location of the virtual machine. A delete selectable icon may enable the user to instruct the host system or virtualization system to delete an associated guest system. A login information selectable icon may enable the user to view login information to access an associated guest system. A server statistics selectable icon may enable a user to instruct the host system or virtualization system to display statistics and status of the associated guest system.

It should be understood that the GUI is illustrative and that a variety of different GUI elements may be utilized to provide for the same or analogous functions shown in the GUI . For example rather than having a download selectable icon the GUI may show icon s of virtual machines and icon s of physical computers thereby allowing a user to drag an icon of a virtual machine onto an icon of a physical computer to copy or move the virtual machine onto a physical computer.

Once the user has entered the information the user may select a Power On soft button to cause the system to perform the copy or move the guest system configure the virtual machine and execute the virtual machine. Alternatively the user may select a close soft button to abort the process. It should be understood that the virtual machine may be one or more files that include instructions that when executed causes the physical computer to execute the guest system.
