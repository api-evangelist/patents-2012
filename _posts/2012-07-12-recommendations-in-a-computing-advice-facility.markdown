title: Recommendations in a computing advice facility
abstract: According to various embodiments, a ratings matrix including matrix values is generated, each row of the ratings matrix identifying one of a plurality of users, each column of the ratings matrix identifying one of a plurality of items, and each of the matrix values corresponding to a known affinity rating describing a degree of affinity associated with one of the users and one of the items. The ratings matrix may include a missing entry representing an unknown affinity rating. According to various embodiments, a revised ratings matrix is generated by factoring the ratings matrix into a user matrix and an item matrix, the revised ratings matrix being the product of the user matrix and the item matrix and including at least one entry representing a predicted affinity rating in place of the missing entry.

This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 506 752 filed Jul. 12 2011 entitled RECOMMENDATIONS IN A COMPUTING ADVICE FACILITY the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present application relates generally to providing recommendations regarding different items to different users.

Online searching for topical advice represents a significant use of computer resources such as provided through the Internet. Computer users may currently employ a variety of search tools to search for advice on specific topics but to do so may require expertise in the use of search engines and may produce voluminous search results that take time to sift through interpret and compare. People may be accustomed to asking other people for advice in spoken natural language and therefore it may be useful to have a computer based advice tool that mimics more closely how people interact with each other. In addition advice on topics may change in time and any static database of advice may fall quickly out of date. Therefore a need exists for improved topical advice search capabilities adapted for use with natural language and that provides for continuous content refinement.

While the invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments other embodiments would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and are encompassed herein.

The present invention may ask the user questions and based on the user s answers the system may offer a decision such as a recommendation a diagnosis a conclusion advice and the like. Internally the system may use machine learning to optimize which questions to ask and what decision to make at the end of the process. The system may learn through users giving feedback on the ultimate decision whether the decision was helpful or not. Helpful solutions may get reinforced and associated with the questions and answers that were asked along the way. When a user says that a decision was helpful the system may remember which questions it asked what the answer to each question was and may associate these questions and answers with the ultimate decision. These associations may be the basis of the machine learning that learns over time which question to ask the next time a user comes to the system.

For example a user may try to get advice picking a bar to visit. The system may ask the question How old are you and get the answer in my 30s . Ultimately the system may show the user the decision Kelley s Irish Bar . Assume the user says this decision was helpful. The system will increase the association between the question How old are you the answer in my 30s and the decision Kelley s Irish Bar . The next time a user comes to the site looking for advice on a bar the system will be more likely to ask the user the How old are you question since in the past this question was useful in helping the user. If the user answers the question in the same way as the prior user saying in my 30s then the system will increase its belief that the ultimate decision is Kelley s Irish Pub .

The system may build a profile of each user s tastes aesthetic preferences etc. and learn via feedback which decisions are liked by which types of people. Alternatively an expert user may specify which kinds of decisions are liked by which kinds of people. Learning user s taste profiles may happen through a separate process from the dialog of questions and answers asked by the system in a specific topic. For example a user may separately tell the system about their taste choices through a different question and answer dialog designed specifically to understand the user s aesthetic preferences.

A user may not want to spend the time to teach the system about all of their taste preferences and so instead the system may learn or an expert may specify which of all the taste questions are the most important taste questions to ask in the context of the user making one specific decision . Out of the universe of all questions the system may know about finding out about taste profiles for instance the system may have learned there are three specific questions that are best for when the user is trying to find a sedan under 25 000. Alternately there may be a completely different set of three taste questions to ask a user who is interested in a SUV over 45 000.

A user may also only tell the system about their taste preferences and not about any objective questions. In this case the system may provide a ranking of all the decisions in an area of advice based purely on taste. So instead of the user saying they want a 200 point and shoot camera effectively what the user would be doing is saying they want a camera that other urban 35 year old men who prefer computers to sports want. Users may indicate this preference by using a search interface and choosing an area of advice that is explicitly labeled cameras for urban men in their 30s instead of the which camera should I buy area of advice. Alternatively users may indicate their interest in making a decision about cameras and then opt to not answer any of the questions in the Q A dialog from the system and thus the system will only have subjective information about the user to use in recommending cameras to the user . Alternatively users may answer questions in the dialog that are both objective and subjective and the system may then recommend a camera based on the combined objective data about the camera and subjective data about the camera.

Users may also enter new questions answers and ultimate decisions. The system may then try out the new questions with future users to see if the questions turn out to be useful in helping those users. For example a user of the bar recommendation service may contribute the question Do you want a loud place or a quiet intimate setting . The system may decide to ask this question in a future use of the bar recommendation service and through the process outlined above observe a correlation between the answers of this question and recommendations that users find useful. On the other hand a user may contribute a question that has no value in helping users. For example a user could contribute the question Do you have a Canon camera . The system may try this question out on future users and fail to notice any correlation between the answers to this question and bar recommendations that users find helpful. In this case the question may get asked less since it s not predictive of whether one recommendation or another recommendation is helpful.

The system may keep asking questions until it feels it has a high confidence in a few possible decisions. The system may also stop sooner if it feels like it has already asked too many questions and risks annoying the user. The system may also ask at least a minimum number of questions to avoid the user feeling that the system couldn t possibly have asked enough to make an intelligent decision.

The system may have a mechanism to tolerate incorrect answers from the user. Incorrect answers may result from the user not understanding the question not understanding the answer or not knowing the answer to the question. If the bulk of the answers given by the user support a particular decision the system may make that decision even though not all the user s answers support that decision.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for at least one of questions and answers between the system and the user decisions to users and machine learning utilized to improve decisions. The system may provide for an improved way to generate questions and answers an improved way to provide decisions to users an improved way to utilize machine learning to improve questions and decisions provided by a system and the like where any of these capabilities may be separately or in combination used as a standalone system or incorporated into a third party system as an improved capability. In embodiments each of these improved capabilities may utilize some form of machine learning as described herein. For example the system may provide for an improved way to execute a question and answer session with a user by learning under what circumstances the user is looking for certain information. For instance it may be learned by the system that the weather is a condition under which users have a differentiated preference depending on the time of day and the weather conditions. When it s raining during the day and a user searches for movies the user may be more likely to be looking for movie tickets and locations where the movie is playing. When it s raining during the night and the user searches for movies the user may be more likely to be looking for a description of the movie. In another example the system may provide for an improved way to provide decisions to users such as learning that users prefer certain formats during the daytime versus during the evening providing choices verses a single decision based on age prefer a greater number of questions prior to presentation of the decision based on the user s geographic location and the like. In another example the system may provide for an improved way to learn what decision to choose for a user such as utilizing greater expert information based on age and education utilizing popular opinion more when the topic is fashion and the user is young versus utilizing traditional practice more when the user is older asking more questions about the user s choices in friends when the topic is personal and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for combinations of question and answer providing decisions and learning what decisions to provide where one of the elements may not be provided by the system such as when that element is provided by a third party system. For example a third party search engine web application may what to improve their capabilities for providing sorted lists from a user s search query and so may want to utilize the present invention s facility for generating questions and answers to augment their keyword search and sort algorithms. In this instance the third party search engine provider may not be interested in the present invention s facility for generating decisions because their service is in the business of providing sorted lists not a limited set of decisions. However the present invention may provide an important new capability to the search engine provider in that the present invention s ability to constantly improve the questions and answers to users may enable the search engine provider to improve their sorting result to users based on the present invention s capabilities.

In embodiments the subject of the initial area of advice may be specified through a search interface. For example a user searching for romantic honeymoons in Italy may get taken to a web page that helps the user decide where to honeymoon in Italy instead of first asking the user questions about where they want to vacation what type of vacation they were looking for etc. Or a user could search for a specific location Italy and be directed to a web page on that 1 helps the user decide if that specific location is a good one for their needs for example showing things like this vacation is good for honeymooners and romantic getaways and bad for family vacations and 2 offers to start a dialog to help the user find alternative and potentially better locations in Italy to vacation. Or a user could be searching for specific products and then enter into a dialog to narrow down which of those products are best for them. In both cases 1 and 2 the information shown may be based how other users have answered questions in decision making dialogs and then given positive feedback to this decision. So if many people using the where should I go on vacation topic answered a question do you want a romantic vacation with yes and then gave positive feedback to Italy the system would display that Italy is a romantic destination to users coming in via search engines. Alternatively the users who added the decision Italy or the question do you want a romantic vacation into the system could have explicitly indicated that the answer yes to the question do you want a romantic vacation should be associated with Italy and thus show that Italy is a romantic vacation to users coming in via search engines.

In embodiments the present invention may provide other combinations of some subset of asking questions making decisions and learning to make better decisions such as using the present invention s facilities for making better decisions but only using input from experts not providing a question and answer session for a particular user but rather utilize previous user interactions with the system to provide decisions asking questions and answers to a user to allow the system to learn in association with future decisions but providing rewards to the user rather than decisions asking question and answers and making a decision without any learning such as simply filtering down results utilizing the present invention s ability to learn how to make a better decision but providing that capability to an expert system rather than to users through a question and answer interface and the like. In embodiments the system may provide for all the elements of a question and answer user session providing decisions to the user and learning how to improve decisions.

In embodiments a user entering a question may optionally specify dependencies and importances for the question. Dependencies may control when the question can be asked. Importances may specify relative importances between different questions for weighing a user s answers. If the system has to make trade offs because no one decision result matches all of the answers specified by a user the system may try to recommend decision results that match high importance questions over lower importance questions. The system may also prioritize asking high importance questions over low importance questions. For example a user entering a new question like Where in the United States do you want to vacation set a dependency that requires an existing question such as Where in the world do you want to go to have been answered with The United States before the new question Where in the United States do you want to vacation can be asked.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a system with a user interface through which the user may interact with the facilities of the system. The system may include several parts some of which may be the website the supervisor and a collection of widgets. Widgets may be collections of code that collect process and render a single piece of content on the website. The website may consist of interfaces for end users staff members and registered users to get decisions edit the decisions and view reports on system performance. The supervisor may be a container for running widgets so that a widget can perform time consuming data collection and processing ahead of user requests to render that content.

For example a widget might collect videos about decisions from the internet. The widget in the supervisor might crawl the web looking for videos about each decision and store videos it finds in a database. When the user comes to the website and gets a particular decision the website may ask the video widget to render itself and display any videos it has previously found.

A plurality of instances of the supervisor may be running on multiple computers in order to scale up the widget s processing. Each widget may be running on its own computer. Similarly many computers may be providing interfaces to the system through web servers instant messaging voice gateways email programmatic APIs via being embedded in third party websites and the like.

In embodiments attributes may be combinations of a question and one particular answer to that question. For example if a question was How old are you and the answers to that question were under 18 20 30 and over 30 then an attribute would be How old are you Under 18 . The system may work by learning the relationship between attributes and decisions. When the system asks a question and the user gives an answer then the system may take that attribute and see which decisions are associated with it.

In embodiments the system may understand that some attributes represent continuous values while others represent discrete values. When using continuous attributes the system may be able to make more intelligent tradeoffs such as understanding that it is frequently acceptable to recommend a product that costs less than the user asked for but rarely acceptable to offer a product that costs more than the user asked for.

In embodiments the relationships between attributes and decisions may be learned from users explicitly given to the system or some combination of the two and the like. For example a price attribute of How much do you want to spend Under 200 might be explicitly linked to cameras that fall into that price range based on data from experts ecommerce sites APIs etc. The relationship between the attribute How will you use the camera On vacations and possible vacation destinations might be fully learned however.

When entering new questions answers and results the user may optionally specify the relationships between attributes and decision results. For example if a user were to enter the question how much do you want to spend in the which camera should I buy topic the user may also specify to the system that the answer under 200 should be associated with cameras X and Y but not camera Z. Then if a future user were to use the which camera should I buy topic and were to answer the how much do you want to spend question with the answer under 200 that user may have a higher chance of being recommended camera X and Y over camera Z.

After seeking advice from the system and receiving a decision result a user may also be given reasons from the system as to why that particular decision result was recommended. This explanation may also allow the user to change the attributes for the decision result if the user believes that the decision result was recommended in error by the system.

In general the relationships learned may involve training from users experts employees automated data feeds from third parties or some combination.

In embodiments there may be various ways that the system can recommend a solution and select the next question to ask the user. Possible machine learning systems may be geometric systems like nearest neighbors and support vector machines probabilistic systems evolutionary systems like genetic algorithms decision trees neural networks associated with decision trees Bayesian inference random forests boosting logistic regression faceted navigation query refinement query expansion singular value decomposition and the like. These systems may be based around learning from complete game plays e.g. all attributes given by a user before getting a decision the answers to individual questions subsets of game plays only positive feedbacks only negative feedbacks or some combination of the two. Additionally the system may take into account previous interactions the user had such as remembering previously answered questions decisions that the user liked or did not like which areas of advice the user previously sought advice in etc. Additionally the system may take into account factors that are implicitly provided by the user such as time of day and date the user used the system the user s IP address client type e.g. Firefox IE cell phone SMS and the like and other such data.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a machine learning system that goes well beyond the capabilities of collaborative filtering such as through explicitly asking questions instead of implicitly learning based on a user s behavior which may be much more powerful since the system is not left trying to infer the user s intent mood etc. Also choosing the questions to ask the user based on what they ve already answered may allow the present invention to zero in on nuances that would otherwise be missed. The present invention may have the ability to explain decisions such as providing decisions beyond simple extrapolations form past behavior such as in other people who bought X Y and Z also liked product A . Instead the present invention may be able to say the user should do A because the user said they wanted X liked Y and believed Z . In addition the present invention may allow users to contribute new questions that may be useful and then automatically learn under which contexts if any the question is helpful. In another area of difference the present invention s machine learning technology may be able to provide decisions in a great variety of user interest areas where collaborative filtering has difficulties being applied to non product media applications. For instance collaborative filtering would not be easily applied to helping a user make a decision on a highly personal topic such as whether they should get a tattoo or a rare question such as whether a particular expense can be deducted on the user s tax return. The present invention may be capable of such applications. In embodiments the present invention may be able to use pre programmed expert advice inter mixed with advice learned from a group of users to make decisions to users.

In embodiments the system may have a wiki web interface for editing all of the data on the system. The web interface may be used to edit create delete questions answers attributes and solutions. Each solution may also have a variety of information associated with it which may be shown on the decision page when that solution is recommended. For example when recommending a vacation in Cancun the recommendation page might show videos about Cancun. All of this ancillary data about the solution may also be editable through the wiki.

In embodiments the wiki may be used to edit data collected by widgets running in the supervisor. This may allow the widgets to collect data ahead of time and then have a human quality assurance process to review and change the collected data.

In embodiments the system may maintain a history of all changes made by either the widgets or humans. For example one use of this history may be to review the work done by hired contractors doing content quality assurance. Another use of this history may be making sure that the widgets do not undo work done by humans. For example if the widgets collect a particular video and a human deletes that video because it is inappropriate then the widget can use the history to not re add that video again sometime in the future. Finally if data is corrupted or incorrectly deleted the history may allow a means of recovery.

In embodiments when widgets find new content they may queue tasks to a human workflow for validating and editing that content.

In embodiments in order to learn the system may sometimes make random or semi random decisions in hopes of recommending something that the system wouldn t have expected to be useful but which may turn out to be useful. If the system wants to use what it has already learned then it may not make random choices in which questions it asks and which decision it makes. There may be a tradeoff between using what is already known also referred to as exploitation and potentially learning something new also referred to as exploration. Exploitation may lead to a more satisfied user while exploration may make the system smarter.

In embodiments one way to make this trade off when selecting questions to ask the user may be to ask questions that the system is confident are useful in making a decision and then picking a few random questions to ask. Another way to make the trade off may be to have a fixed budget in every user interaction where a fixed set of questions are based on exploitation and the next set are based on exploration.

In embodiments decisions may also be explored or exploited. If the system wants to learn it may show a random decision. Instead of showing a purely random decision the system may also show a decision that meets some requirements specified by the user and is purely exploring within the remaining requirements. For example instead of picking a random camera to show the user the system could pick a random camera that meets the user s price requirements. This may result in more efficient training since the system may be less likely to show a decision that has no chance of meeting the user s needs. Rather than showing a random decision when exploring the system may also show both the exploited decision and an explored solution and get feedback on each separately from the user. Alternatively the system could inject a limited amount of randomness and pick a decision like what the system s best guess is. For example the system may predict that the user will like one particular camera but could instead recommend another similar but not identical camera in order to balance making a reasonable decision and still learning new information from the user. In embodiments the system may identify to the user when it is asking questions or making decisions through exploration vs. exploitation or it may not.

In embodiments the system may be viewed as surveying users about the various things it is recommending. For example the system may ask the user 10 questions about the Canon SD1000 camera. This may provide a rich set of data about each camera allowing the system to start building lists of what kind of user is likely to like this camera. The system may build a ranked list of decisions for each attribute such as from most likely to be liked to least likely to be liked given that attribute. For example the system may build a list of cameras in order likely to be liked by people who say Flow old are you Over 50 . This may be shown by the system as the top 10 cameras for users over 50. Numerous of these top 10 lists may be constructed based on the system s data. These lists may also be combined to form new lists. For example given the ranked lists of cameras for the attribute How old are you Over 50 and another list for the attribute Why are you buying a camera Travel the system may construct a new ranked list of cameras for the Over 50 year old users who want a travel camera . These combinations of top lists may be pre generated generated on demand by incrementally asking the user to select new top lists and the like.

In embodiments these top lists may be used for a variety of purposes. Some users may not want to answer a series of questions before receiving a decision. Instead they may be able to browse through these lists and find a relevant decision. The system may have a large number of top lists such as thousands or tens of thousands each of which may have their own web page. In addition these pages may contain a large amount of content that may be indexed by search engines and bring users to the system s website. Alternatively users may use a search interface in the system itself to find the area of advice they want a decision in. Various top lists may be used to short cut the dialog by implicitly answering some of the questions in the dialog based on the toplist. For example there could be an area of advice called vacations and a top list called romantic honeymoon vacations in Italy that servers as a short cut or gateway into the vacations topic with several questions from the vacations dialog already answered Where do you want to go Europe Where in Europe do you want to go Italy Are you traveling on a special occasion Yes What is the special occasion honeymoon . This may serve as an alternate interface for the user to seek advice through a traditional search interface without engaging in a question and answer dialog.

In embodiments various pages on the site may have self contained displays of information called widgets. For example the decision pages may have a widget that shows how other people who liked this question answered various questions videos pictures about the decision links to other web sites that have information about the decision personalized pros and cons of this decision based on how the user answered questions lists of other decisions that a similar lists of other decisions that would have been made had questions been answered differently lists of awards honors for this decision such as Consume Reports recommended and the like.

In embodiments the system may allow users to navigate through the universe of decisions e.g. cameras vacation destinations etc along dimensions that are not commonly available. For example instead of being shown a camera and only letting the user say show me more less expensive cameras the system may let the user say show me cameras that are more liked by young people show me a camera that is better for travel and less stylish and the like. Dimensions like style good for travel bad for young people and the like may be generated as a side effect by asking users questions and then learning what is a good decision given those answers.

In embodiments navigating along alternative dimensions may be used as a starting point for the user instead of the user selecting an area to seek advice in and then engaging in a dialog. The user may start interacting with the system by using a search interface or an external search engine to search for a specific decision result such as a product name or travel destination. The system would then show the user information about that specific decision result and allow the user to navigate to other decision results engage in a dialog to refine what the user is looking for or show the user information that the system has learned through machine learning expert advice or some combination about this specific decision result. For example a user may use a search interface to navigate to a web page showing information on a Canon SD1100 camera. The system may show other cameras that people looking for a Canon SD1100 also like allow the user to find similar cameras along non traditional feature dimensions such as a camera that is better for taking pictures of sporting events as well as show what the system knows about the Canon SD1100 such as great for travel not good for people learning photography Available for under 200 Preferred by people who are consider themselves design conscious and the like.

In embodiments another possible interface may be to show users a list of decisions and display a simple explanation for why each decision is being made. For example when recommending cameras the system may show three cameras and say that one is cheaper one has longer zoom and the other is better for travel . This may help the user see alternatives that they may not have otherwise seen based on how they answered the questions leading up to the decision .

In embodiments users may be asked different types of questions such as questions about the item being recommended price color etc questions about themselves and the like. The system may differentiate users along dimensions such as psychographic dimensions demographic dimensions and the like. Properties of users that may be predictive may include the user s age sex marital status whether they live in rural urban areas frequencies of church attendance political affiliation aesthetic preferences sense of irony sense of humor socio economic background taste preference for neat or disorganized lifestyle degree to which they plan ahead of time and the like.

In embodiments it may be difficult to directly ask questions and instead the system may try to measure things that are correlated instead. For example instead of asking about income the system might ask where the user prefers to shop e.g. Wal Mart Target Saks etc . Aesthetics may be determined via showing pictures of art living rooms clothes and the like and asking which style the user prefers. In embodiments pictures may take the place of the question and the answers may be about how you react to the picture or the picture can take the place of answers to questions such as Which of the following best resembles the clothes you like to wear .

In embodiments the system may group questions by whether they are about the item being recommended or about the user. The system may explain what type of questions it is asking in order to help the user understand the value of otherwise surprising and potentially offensive questions being asked. The system may also display other types of messages to the user while asking questions such as telling the user how many questions remain taunting the user by saying the system can already guess what decision to make and the like.

In embodiments instant messenger IM systems may provide a natural interface to the question and answer dialog of the system. For example a user may invite our system to their buddy list and then initiate a dialog to get a decision over IM. The system may IM the first question to the user the user may then IM their answer back and the like until eventually the system IM ed the user a link to the decision or directly IM ed the name of the decision to the user. In embodiments other forms of communications may also be used such as cell phones SMS email and the like.

In embodiments the system such as in the form of an application may be embedded in third party web sites. For example the system could be put on a website that sells cameras and offer to recommend relevant cameras to the user. Alternatively after the user searched for cameras and had a list of potential cameras they were interested in the system could ask questions to help the user decide amongst the list of cameras. For example if all of the cameras that the user was considering were good for travel the system would not ask about how the user wanted to use the camera but the system might realize that asking whether interchangeable lenses were desired could be used to recommend one camera over another.

In embodiments the system may make decisions in a plurality of topic areas such as products e.g. cameras TVs GPS navigation home audio laptops bath beauty baby garden outdoor automobiles jewelry watches apparel shoes and the like travel e.g. where to go where to stay what region to visit what to do there and the like financial e.g. which mortgage whether to refinance which credit card whether something is deductible on taxes what type of IRA to save in asset allocation for investments and the like gifts for various holidays and occasions other date based decisions what to dress up for Halloween and the like personality e.g. about a user s personality about their relationships their career and the like recommending the right pet drinks and other aspects of night life books movies film music concerts TV shows video games where to eat what to order celebrity related such as which celebrity the user is most similar to recommending a gift what neighborhood to live in what to watch on television and the like.

In embodiments the system may be used to diagnose problems such as in the areas of technology IT e.g. computer software printers home networking wireless business networks performance issues and the like medical health automotive relationship or interpersonal problems home and building problems and the like.

In embodiments users of the system may be either anonymous or logged in users. A logged in user may be one that has created an account on the site. Logged in users may also have profile pages about them. Content on the profile page may include basic information about that user nickname picture etc decisions they have received and liked decisions the system predicts the user will like even though the user has not answered questions in that topic area lists of facts about the user that the user has given so that they do not need to be repeated each time the user uses the system for a decision e.g. the user s age or their aesthetic preferences can be given once and remembered across different times the user uses the system lists of tasks that the system thinks the user may be qualified and interested in doing via the wiki such as reviewing new user submitted content fixing spelling errors in user submitted content reviewing new content found by the widgets etc other users with similar answers to questions and the like.

In embodiments users may also have various titles ranks or levels which may affect what they can do on the system. For example some users may be given the title of moderator in a particular topic which would allow those users to edit certain aspects of those topics. The ranks and titles may be assigned manually or by through automatic means including being based on how many decisions they have given how many new questions or solutions they have contributed to the system how many tasks they have accomplished using the wiki how well they answer certain questions in the various topics and the like.

In embodiments non logged in users may not have the benefit of using the system with a large selection of aesthetic or taste based preferences already entered into their profiles. Based on learning or manual training from logged in users the system may select some aesthetic questions to ask in question dialogs when non logged in users seek advice in particular topic areas. For example based on logged in users answering taste questions about themselves and then giving feedback about which cars they like and don t like the system may learn that a question about whether the user enjoys gourmet dining is useful to ask non logged in users trying to decide between a Toyota and a Lexus. Using the attribute associations learned or manually specified by logged in users the system may then adjust whether it recommends the Toyota or the Lexus to the non logged in user.

In embodiments the system may learn from users submitting feedback on decisions. Some users may either intentionally or unintentionally give incorrect feedback. For example a vendor may try to game the system to make their product be highly recommended. Alternatively a user who does not know much about video games may recommend a video game that in reality is not a good video game. The system may try to filter out feedback from these users by a variety of means. The system may throttle the number of feedbacks that a given user can submit and have a higher throttle limit if the user is logged in or has a high rank title . The system may also throttle or weight feedback based on how well the user answers certain test questions during the question answer phase in order to test the user s knowledge of the subject and weigh feedback from knowledgeable users more than unknowledgeable users. The system may also require the user to pass a captcha Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart before their feedback is counted or they get a decision. The system may also look at the series of answers given by the user and weight the user s feedback based on that series of answers. For example if the user either always clicked the first answer or the user clicked in a very improbable way then the system may weight that user s feedback lower. Finally the system may change the weight of the user s feedback or decide to not show a decision based on the history of previous game plays. For example the 10th time a user tries to get a camera decision the system may weight their feedback less than on the 9th time.

In embodiments the system may include search engine optimization SEO the process of improving the system s website rankings within major search engines. This process may be broken down into several mostly automated steps such as discovering the keywords that users are searching for understanding the competition in the search engines to have the site s page come up when users search for these words understanding how search engines rank sites understanding what changes to the system s website need to be made in order to increase the site s ranking for common searches and the like.

In embodiments discovering keywords that users may be searching for may be found through different means such as using keyword suggestion tools such as what Google and Yahoo provide using data about historical searches licensed from third party data providers and crawling other websites to see what words they use and the like. Once these keywords are found the system may use the data in many ways such as bidding on those words via search engine marketing SEM developing content on the system s site about those keywords in hopes of getting search traffic in the future looking at how our competitors are using those same keywords and the like.

In embodiments the system may understand what other sites are doing and how they rank in the search engines by running keywords through the search engines and looking at who is advertising on each keyword and what the top natural search results are for each keyword. The sites discovered through this process may be crawled to discover more potential keywords. The system may also decide to develop new content or avoid a market based on this competitive information. If there are few highly ranked sites in a content area the system may develop content in that area.

In embodiments the system may understand that paid advertisements that bring users to the site are relatively cheap in one topic area of advice on the site and expensive in another. The system may therefore try to advertise for the low cost traffic help those users with their decision and then recommend that those users use the system in a topic area that is expensive to advertise and buy traffic in. For example the system may run ads for people who want to figure out what dog breed they should buy help those users decide what dog breed is right for them and then direct them to figure out where they should buy their pet medicines. The latter topic area being one that may be expensive for the system to source traffic in due to expensive ad rates while the former topic area may be relatively cheap as few existing businesses may be competing for customers who want advice on what type of dog to get.

In embodiments the system may understand how search engines rank their natural non sponsored search results by studying the relationship between sites that come up when a search is done and factors of those sites. Possible factors that may be correlated between sites that come up with high ranking may be factors such as the content of the site number and quality of other sites linking to the site the type of content on those other linking sites and the like. From the prior step the system may generate a list of site factors ranked by their ability to increase a sites ranking in the search engines and the like. The system may then use this ranked list to make changes to the site to increase the probability that the site as a whole or certain pages on the site will be highly ranked in the search engines.

Search engines may typically utilize a keyword index to find documents relevant to a user s query. In embodiments the present invention may utilize a decision index which may also map user input to relevant documents. The index may be built automatically experts may hand build the index the index may be learned through feedback from different types of users who implicitly or explicitly decide to train the system and the like. The results of the search utilizing the decision index may be displayed as a list of documents a single document and the like.

Referring to an embodiment for a list of topics in the system from which users may get decisions is presented including cameras cell phones coffee and espresso drinks favorite celebrity GPS devices grills Halloween laptops personality toe rings TVs vacations video games watches and the like. In addition there may be an indicator as to the number of decisions learned from user ratings such as learned from 43 921 user ratings.

Referring to an embodiment of an example question that the system may ask a user is provided. In this example the user is asking for a decision related to the purchase of a camera and the question is How much are you willing to spend The user may now choose from the selection such as to select between less than 200 up to 300 up to 500 more than 500 I don t know and the like. In addition there may be an indication as to how many questions may be asked such as in In questions or less get camera decisions preferred by people like you. In embodiments the user may also offer their own question their own answer their own decision and the like where the system may utilize this information in the current or future decision session. In embodiments the user may choose to skip the question where the user may now be provided an alternate decision based on a reduced amount of information available from the user the system may ask the user alternate questions to make up for the skipped question the question may have been a test question and will not affect the resulting decision and the like.

Referring to an embodiment of an example picture question that the system may ask a user . In this example the system may be asking a question whose answer may better enable the system to determine a personal characteristic of the user . For instance the question as illustrated asks Which of these causes you the most concern where the picture choices are indicative of certain topics such as pollution finances national defense health and the like. This question may be targeted to the current user or be inserted as an experimental question. In embodiments the user may be informed that the question is an experimental question such as shown in with the header that reads Finally please answer the experimental questions submitted by another user. 

Referring to an embodiment of an example of the type of information the system may show the user when making a particular decision is presented. For example the decision may be for a certain camera where information is provided about the camera such as a description who uses it the best cost for the camera how it compares to other cameras and the like. In embodiments other decisions may be provided such as with a relative ranking by a score by a percentage matching and the like. The user may also be queried for feedback such as being asked if the decision is a good decision. In addition the user may be provided with the opportunity to find out more about the decision such as more about the product best price finder websites to more advice and the like.

Referring to and the user may be provided with various top lists associated with a topic as described herein such as presented in association with a decision in association with a user s request to view top lists and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide users with a home page including user identification personal representation past decisions made future topics for consideration decision to make today and the like. provides an example of a user home page such as what the user sees when they are logged into the system account. Here there may be a display of recent decisions the system recommended lists of popular topics to get decisions in a search interface to find topics status updates about the user getting benefits for contributing to the system recent activity access to the user s profile and the like.

In embodiments users may be able to decide they want to contribute expertise to the system such as in a teach the system mode. shows an example of various links pages that may allow a user to contribute such as giving the system training about various decisions rating the quality of pictures and user contributed prose finding duplicate items and questions contributing new decision making topics contributing new questions to existing topics and the like.

In embodiments the user after choosing a topic for the system to make decisions for may be asked questions. provides an example of how a question may be presented to the user. As shown the presentation of the question to the user may provide different elements such as a topic heading a picture or illustration associated with the topic a question a set of answer choices and the like.

After answering questions the user may be provided an answer or decision associated with the user s original question. show an example of how a decision may be presented to the user and may include a primary decision information summarizing the decision alternate decisions variations on the decision and the like. In addition the user may be provided with an opportunity to provide feedback to the system such as whether the user agrees with the decision or not. The user may also be provided other suggested topics such as based on the current topic answers provide history of answers a user s profile a user s history of questions topics that other users found helpful and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a facility for providing an improved way to provide decisions to a user with a question across a broad category of topics including products personal health business political educational entertainment the environment and the like. For example the system may provide decisions on everything from whether a user should break up with their boyfriend to whether you should get a tattoo or not to whether you can deduct something on your taxes in addition to product decisions and the like. In embodiments the system may provide decisions on any interest a user may have.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a decision system that is flexible and is capable of changing and growing. This may be partly enabled by the system s use of a dialog of questions and answers to make a decision and then getting feedback from the user so the system can improve. In embodiments this approach may be significantly more powerful since the system may ask any question and therefore get much better information from the user about their wants. In addition users may be able to extend the system by entering their own questions and answers for the system to ask entering in new decisions for the system to make and the like. The system may then automatically try out newly entered information to see if it is useful or helpful and use this new information to determine if it is useful and possibly stop asking using the questions decisions that may not be as helpful to users. In embodiments this approach may provide for building a wisdom of the crowds based decision making expert system for potentially any topic.

In embodiments the present invention may also provide improved decision facility to the user by providing decisions by ranking across non traditional feature dimensions. For example instead of just ranking cameras by price or size the system may rank cameras based on how much they re liked by retired people how sexy they look and the like. The system may then help users navigate across these dimensions. For instance instead of users just being able to say I like this camera but want a cheaper one the system may let them do things like say I like this camera but want one better for learning photography or I like this vacation but want one with a more active social scene .

In embodiments the present invention may lend itself to a variety of different user interfaces such as a web interface instant messaging voice cell phone SMS instant messaging third party use e.g. a widget on a third party web service sold to a third party and the like. For example a voice interface may be well suited to the system since there may be a very limited vocabulary that the system must recognize such as just the possible answers to each question. In this way if the system can t understand a user response it may just move on to another question instead of annoying the user by asking them to repeat their answer over and over. In another example the present invention may be integrated into a third party site such as a search for a TV on an e commerce website where the present invention is a widget to help the user narrow down the results or using the present invention as a widget in association with a real estate website to build an MLS query for the user to find a house that is a good match for them. In embodiments the present invention may provide a user interface both in regard to a physical interface and in the way questions answers and decisions are presented that provides the user with a significantly improved way to obtain decisions on a great variety of topics.

In embodiments the present invention may be integrated into third party products in such as way as to improve the third party s user interface and user satisfaction. For example some website services provide predictions through past purchase history. In this case the present invention may be able to explore a user s mood or intent such as through asking explicit questions. In the case of search engines the present invention may be able to detect when the user is trying to make a decision and then start to ask them follow on questions. In the case of forum sites mailing lists news groups and the like the present invention may provide improved access to decisions and decisions that were made by people similar to the user. For example the present invention may be able to search through all the forum posts to find people who are in the same situation as the user and providing what decision the forum community recommended to them.

In embodiments the present invention may be able to extend e commerce web application user interfaces. For instance a user may start a product search with a keyword search and then ask questions to narrow down the results to the best decision for the user. The present invention may be able to provide a Q A interface for picking a product once the user clicks into a category page. For example after clicking cameras on the website the user might see a first question. The present invention may be able to rank products along dimensions that are based on how users answer questions. For example cameras might be ranked from best to worst travel camera based on how people answer the question What do you want a camera for Answer Travel and then whether they give positive or negative feedback to a particular camera. This may allow the e commerce website to rank a list of camera keyword search results from best to worst travel cameras.

In embodiments the present invention may be able to provide an improved search engine capability such as detecting when a user is trying to make a decision and switching to a Q A interface based on the search results from a keyword search ask follow up questions to narrow down or re rank the results ask questions in order to build a keyword search query or to refine a search query learn feedback based on which links a user clicks after being asked questions and the like. In addition the present invention may implicitly learn about the user and alter rankings based on these implicit facts such as what time of day they re using the system where they are in the world what type of browser they re using weather where they are and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may be able to provide a way for information to be gathered and utilized by users. For instance Wikipedia is a way for users to contribute information such that the end user must to some extent self validate the accuracy of the information subsequently supplied to them. In a similar fashion the present invention may be able to host a web application that utilizes user contributed content. For instance instead of learning what the prices of cameras are the web application could have users input the prices of cameras and then allow other users to self validate these claims. In this way the scope of the contributed information may be allowed to grow organically as users interact with the system.

In embodiments some e commerce applications may provide for products and or services that are associated with personal preference and so may benefit from the present invention. For instance there are currently several movie rental web services where the user selects movies for delivery to their home through the mail. Decisions are also provided to the user based on what the user has selected in the past. However choosing a movie may involve personal interests at the time of rental that cannot be determined by past selections such as mood intent weather are they going to be alone or with someone their current personal relationships and the like. These types of interests may be explored with the present invention through questioning and as such may provide a much more personalized match to the user s interests at the time of rental.

In embodiments local search applications may be improved through the use of the present invention. For example if a user wanted a decision on where to eat dinner they might search for dinner in new york and find a website with suggestions targeted to the query. This interface however falls short when the user doesn t have a clear idea as to what keywords to include. For instance the user might not know the key options for food and might not think to search for ethiopian food new york. The present invention may have the advantage of being able to figure out what question it should ask in order to narrow down the possibilities. In embodiments the present invention may be able to aid in the building of a search query.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for an improved way to match up users and experts users and other knowledge based users and the like. For instance a service may be provided to collect users and experts on different topics. Users may then come to the web interface of the service and enter into a session of Q A where the best match is determined. As a result of the questions the system may provide a decision where the profile of the expert or other user is provided and where the user may be asked if they agree with the recommended individual. In embodiments the user may be provided a home page where previous matches and communications may be kept forwarded to friends experts rated and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a platform for a community based question and answer application. For instance users may post questions to the system and other users may be allowed to respond. In such a system a user may receive answers from a single user multiple users an automated system and the like where the user may be able to choose which answer they feel is correct. This answer may be kept private posted for others to view posted as the correct answer provided to the system and the like. In embodiments the system may use the questions and answers to further develop the system provide more accurate answers to users sort the answers provided to the user filter the answers provided to the user and the like. In addition users of the system may provide feedback to answers provided by other users contribute to filtering criteria for eliminating incorrect answers and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may be used as entertainment through machine learning capabilities as described herein. For instance a user may provide an input or think of an idea such as a topic a keyword a category a question a feeling and the like and the system may make a guess as to what it is through a series of questions and answers. For example the user may think of an object such as baseball and the system may utilize machine learning capabilities such as geometric systems to provide questions to the user. A typical question may relate to size such as is it bigger than a toaster These questions may then be answered by the user such as through multiple choice selection fill in the blank true false free response and the like. The system may then continue the question and answer sequence until it has a guess and provide this guess to the user. In embodiments this process may continue for a fixed number of questions a random number of questions a user specified number of questions a system determined number of questions a system specified number of questions and the like. In embodiments the system may provide the user with a user interface such as through the Internet via a website through a stand alone computational device through a mobile computational device through a phone service through a voice interface in association with an instant messaging service through text messaging and the like. In embodiments the system may be provided to a third party such as a widget to another website as an API to a third party application and the like. In embodiments the present invention may use non neural networks for entertainment applications such as playing games.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a system to assist in the discovery of new drugs where the system may provide an aid in the selection and combination of molecules in creating a new drug. For example the system may ask the user about information associated with chemical parameters such as solubility reactivity toxicity and the like and combine these with questions to probe the user s expertise in recognizing molecular structures. As the question and answer sequence progresses the system may provide the user with insights as to which molecular structures may be stable and synthesizable. In embodiments the process may continue until the user has an improved sense for what molecular combinations may make for a new drug until the choice of new exploratory routes are available for presentation to the user until an new potential drug is identified and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for an image finder application where the user may be assisted in identifying an image that fits some subjective criteria that is not necessarily explicitly known to the user. For example a user may be involved in the development of a brochure for a company where they have the text for the brochure but need to select an image to support the ideas and emotions that the text is trying to convey. The user may in this instance have a subjective idea as to what type of photograph may be required but not necessarily to the extent that they could specify a search with keywords. The user may instead first specify the source of the images such as from a file a database a website service from Google images from an advertiser image bank and the like. Then the user may be asked a series of questions or be presented with a series of images to choose from. The answers and or selections that the user chooses may then be utilized in refining the choices that are next presented to the user and from which further questions and or image selections may be provided. In embodiments this process may continue until the user finds an image to select as the final image. Additionally the system may take the user s final selection and select a group of other similar images for presentation to the user at which time the user may choose to continue the process of selection refinement.

In embodiments the present invention may be used in a baby naming application where the user may have only a vague sense of what names they might prefer. The user may be initially asked different types of questions intended to provide the system with information to aid in the learning of the user s preferences such as questions about family friends education heritage geographic location place of birth hobbies books read movies watched and the like. The system may then continue to learn through the presentation of questions associated with name preference in a plurality of ways such as rating name choosing from a list of names answering questions pertaining to name and the like. In embodiments this process may continue until the user finds a name to select as the final name. Additionally the system may take the user s final selection and select a group of other similar names for presentation to the user at which time the user may choose to continue the process of selection refinement.

In embodiments future questions and decisions provided by the machine learning facility may be improved through feedback provided by the user .

In embodiments the present invention may provide results based on multiple dimensions such as a result based on a textual match from a user input based on the user s taste profile and the like. shows an example search interface showing search results for the user query fios . In this example the rankings are based on first finding decisions and decision results recommendations that are a good textual match for the user query and then second ranking the decision results by the knowledge the system has about the user s taste profile. In this example fios is a good textual match for the decision results Verizon FIOS as the recommendation to Which ISP should I use and What US satellite cable service provider should I get and both are this users 1 ranked result based on the user s taste preferences.

In embodiments the present invention may provide multiple question and answer results in response to a user s unstructured input. For example shows a case where the user s query is suv . The first result is for the topic What new car should I buy but with the question what type of car do you want already answered with suv . This may provide a bridge between unstructured search and the structured Q A data that the system stores. Further as shown in the example the user s top 3 results are displayed personalized based on their taste profiles. Effectively the user has done a keyword search and gotten results without explicitly answering any questions via the traditional Q A interface such as for the other questions provided as examples shown Which BMW should I buy What late model used car should I buy and What tires should I use on my car or truck .

In embodiments the present invention may ask the user to express their preferences when they have given answers to questions that either contradict each other are mutually exclusive or which each individually have a dramatic affect on the rankings of results for the user. For example the user may start the What new car should I buy topic and answered that they want a SUV that is under 18 000 and is more practical than extravagant. The system may want to get the user s preference as to what is more important that the vehicle be an SUV or under 18 000. shows an example question to the user asking for their preference.

In embodiments the system may learn a set of question importances that are per user per decision result per question s answer per decision result and the like. For example the system may learn that user A cares more about weight than price when it comes to buying small cameras but cares more about price than anything else when it comes to buying cars.

In embodiments users may extend the system by adding new decision results. Those new decision results may optionally include links to web pages to read more about the decision result. The system may automatically convert those links to affiliate links such that the system receives commissions from the site that the link points to. Further based on the link submitted by the user the system may recognize what kind of link it is and understand how to parse out information such as price for products such as from Amazon.com or parse out product codes so that vendor specific API calls can be made to look up product information based on the product codes.

In embodiments users may be clustered into groups using dimension reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition SVD eigenvector and other like based approaches. The system may display information about why a group of users were clustered together. One way to do this is to find the top X dimensions in the low dimension space that the cluster as a whole differs most on from the population average. The divergence of the cluster s distribution of answers from the general population s distribution in each dimension in the sub space may be used to rank dimensions in terms of how well they explain what is unique about each cluster.

In embodiments the dimensions in the sub space may not be easily described or interpreted due to their being composed of many different features such as how people answered questions or which decision results they like. One way to explain what each dimension means may be to find questions and answers that are most correlated with the different extremes of the dimension and label the dimension with these questions answers.

In embodiments one way to cluster users may be to pick an initial random grouping of users and iteratively move users between clusters to minimize how much users differ from each other in their own cluster. After some number of iterations the process may be stopped or the process may continue until a threshold amount of error has been reached.

In embodiments the present invention may facilitate matching by user similarity. Given a username email address numeric user id and the like provide a list of other users who are similar or dissimilar in some way. For example given a Facebook username provide a ranked list of other Facebook users who have similar tastes over all or in some specific way such as in electronics. In addition this list may be optionally restricted such as to other users being one degree away in the social graph from the first user e.g rank my friends on Facebook by their similarity to me so that I can ask the one most like me a question . In embodiments user similarity may be computed via asking a user questions about themselves looking at their social graph using context like their location IP address time and the like. The social graph may be used by mapping users in the social graph to known users in other data sets based on heuristics on username email address first name last name birthday address sex and other like information. Adjacent people may be searched in the social graph to bring more people into consideration even if they are more removed from the person you are trying to triangulate in on. For example combining a social graph from Facebook with users who have written reviews on Amazon to find users on Facebook who are most like me and then look at what laptops they tend to like on Amazon in order to give me a laptop recommendation. In another example reviews may be filtered on a site such as Yelp Tripadvisor Amazon and the like based on people similar to you. This information may then be used to help the user such as recommending users to friend on Facebook to follow on Twitter and the like. provide examples of similarity profiles as may be provided by the present invention.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a level of indirection between recommendations by instead recommending people who in turn like dislike things. The present invention may recommend things to buy based on what similar users bought on Amazon places to eat based on similar users on Yelp Zagat Foursquare and the like things to click on in Google search results based on what similar people clicked on and the like. For example consider the problem of recommending which users a new user to Twitter should follow. The present invention may look at all the users on Twitter and who follows them and match some of those followers to the data set of the present invention knowing things about each user based on the questions they have answered about themselves. This could also match the followers to other users such as Amazon users Yelp users and the like to learn other things about them. Based on this the present invention may make inferences about the followers of a particular user such at a Twitter user. Now a new user may be asked about themselves and find which existing user s followers this new user is most like. A recommendation may then be generated for the new Twitter user to follow the existing Twitter user whose followers are most like the new user.

In embodiments the present invention may facilitate real time personalization such as making recommendations that immediately reflect new information from a user immediately use their social graph new facts about them their context such as changing location etc. to re rank recommendations or otherwise improve results.

In embodiments the present invention may match based on context such as location time weather social graph and the like such as implicitly using location to show nearby places a user might like to eat drink sites they might like to see things to do etc. For example this process may then be used in a mobile application that has access to location data via GPS. Optionally the recommendation may be informed by other parts of the user s context such as the current weather e.g. don t recommend a place that people only like because of the patio if it s raining current time e.g. don t recommend nightclubs at 10 am calendar e.g. know when user is busy and where they have to be in the future social graph e.g. recommend places that the user s friends are at all else being equal and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a natural language question and answer interface such as to allow freeform or structured input from a user about a decision or recommendation they want help with. The input may be categorized either by asking the user having other users review the question using automated techniques like natural language processing i.e. is this question about electronics travel cars or some other topic and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may find similar users to the requesting user who has expertise in the category of the question. For example the user may want advice about hotels in L.A. from people who have similar taste in hotels AND know something about L.A. hotels such as either self described knowledge or demonstrated knowledge based on their actions . For example the present invention may then alert those similar users to the new question and requesting their help in solving it. Consideration may be given to how many prior questions alerts they have been sent how many they have already responded to how helpful their responses have been and the like. Similar users may be allowed to engage in a dialog with the requesting user to help inform the requesting user s decision or recommendation problem. The resulting dialog may be stored for others to use and encourage the similar users to index the dialog into a structured form to aid later recall by other requesting users.

The present invention may provide third party sites with the ability to learn about their users finding similar users and making recommendations such as independently of direct user interaction with the system. In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties such as third parties hosting their own web sites may use to learn about the tastes preferences likes dislikes and other attributes of a user where the user is not engaged in a dialog or interacting directly with the computing facility of the present invention. For example a user may go to a website such as Amazon.com and make an inquiry about a product. In this instance Amazon may have an API of the present invention that enables the creation or enhancement of a taste and preference profile of a user so as to better determine the user s tastes preferences and the like and so enable the third party to better target meaningful responses back to the user with regard to the user inquiry. In embodiments the third party may use the API to determine the tastes preferences and the like of the user without user interaction such as by determining their tastes and preferences through previous interactions with the user where these previous interactions may be from previous interactions while on the third party site such as Amazon in this example or from previous interactions with other websites hosting a similar API or through direct interaction with a facility of the present invention. In embodiments the API may be used by a plurality of users such that interactions with the users may be used to identify other similar users and so use the choices decisions selection recommendations and the like of these other similar users to aid in the selection of recommendations to the present user. In embodiments these other similar users may be associated with the third party hosting the API or from another host API site or from a facility of the present invention. In embodiments the use of an API of the present invention hosted by a third party site may provide a significant advantage to the third party site with regard to recommendations that are relevant to the tastes preferences likes dislikes attributes and the like of the user.

In embodiments tastes and preferences of a user may be determined or augmented though other users such as other similar users other users that are connected to the user in a social network other users that are associated through a personal or professional activity other users that are friends or family and the like. In embodiments this may be done without the need to ask questions of the user. For instance a user may have an existing taste and preference profile as established through the present invention and that profile may be improved by collecting or inferring information about other users in their social network family place of business and the like. In embodiments the user s profile may be improved through inferring additional tastes and preferences from other similar users or users shown to have some connection to the user such as through a social network. In embodiments the user s profile may be improved through choices made by other similar users such as in a product selection recommendation and the like. In embodiments the system may learn about a known user s taste profile though their rating things they like and don t like or through the use of natural language processing such as inferring a taste profile by analyzing how the user tags their user profile.

Referring to in embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a third party website to learn about a user through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to the third party website to determine preferences of the user as applied to a market of the third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the market of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and storing them as a user preference profile 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website associated with the market of the third party and 5 supplying a recommendation to the third party based on the user preference profile and the third party information to aid the third party in the answering of the received query . In embodiments the determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The third party information may consist of at least one of product information from product manufacturers product information from web merchants pricing information from other websites availability information from other websites pricing information from merchants availability information from merchants a review comments and ratings. The preference learning API may enable the collection of at least one of cost information product information personal information and topical information. Further user profile preferences may be additionally based on information inferred from a user s social network where the user may not receive additional dialog between the user and the computer facility.

Referring to the present invention may provide for the use of a taste and preference API to target responses returned to a user such as for targeting advertising show reviews from similar users recommend products or services show similar people on social networks to rank search results based on which results similar users clicked on most and the like. In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps target responses returned to a user through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of a user as related to a market of a third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the market of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and storing them as a user preference profile 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website and 5 using in the user preference learning API the third party information related to the market of the third party and the preferences of the user as stored in the user preference profile to provide a response back to the user that relates to the query from the user . In embodiments the computing facility may be a machine learning facility.

The response may be providing an advertisement to the user where the advertisement may be based on the preferences of the user as stored in the user preference profile. The advertisement is provided by the computer facility provided through the third party and enabled through preferences provided to the third party from the computer facility delivered to other users in a user s social network and the like. The response may provide a recommendation of a product service and the like related to the market of the third party. Collecting the preferences of at least a second user may form a user preference profile for the second user determining the second user to be similar to the user based on a comparison of preference profiles. The response may be providing a recommendation made by the second user. The collecting of preferences for the second user may be taken from an internet based social construct and the response provides information to the user that shows the second user as a similar person on the construct where the internet based social construct may be a social network. The collecting of preferences for the at least second user may include search result selections the query may be a search request and the response may be a search result ranked according to the search result selections of the at least second user. The collecting may be from recommendations purchases and search result choices made by the user. The collecting may be from sources that reveal location behaviors of the user. The source may be a user location information such as from the web services foursquare yelp Google Gowalla Facebook and the like. The source may be user location information from a service provider. The third party information may consist of at least one of product information from product manufacturers product information from web merchants pricing information from other websites availability information from other websites pricing information from merchants availability information from merchants a review comments and ratings. The determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The API may enable the collection of cost information product information personal information topical information and the like. The collecting may be from a user s interactions as represented in an Internet based social interactive construct where the internet based social interactive construct may be a social network. The response may be a list of reviews sorted by a review author s similarity to the user reading the reviews. Collecting the preferences of the user may be through third party websites. The collecting may be through crawling third party websites.

In embodiments the present invention may utilize a taste and preference API that third parties may use to target advertising to a user based on the user s preferences where the user is not engaged in a dialog or interacting directly with the computing facility of the present invention. For instance a user may have previously undergone a dialog of questions and answers with the system and through that dialog the system may have developed a taste and preference profile for the user. In embodiments the dialog may have been provided directly with a facility of the present invention or through a third party API provided by the present invention. Alternately the user may have never interacted with a facility of the present invention where the user s taste and preference profile may be created and updated through the user s interactions responses recommendations reviews and the like. In embodiments the system may learn about a known user s taste profile though their rating things they like and don t like or through the use of natural language processing such as inferring a taste profile by analyzing how the user tags their user profile. The taste and preference profile for the user may then be used to target advertising to the user such as advertising that is matched to the user s tastes and preferences. For example a third party taste and preference API may be associated with an outdoor store website such as L.L. Bean REI EMS and the like where the outdoor store is trying to improve their targeting of advertising to their customers. A customer may then visit the outdoor store website and make a query for a product such as for hiking boots. The taste and preference API may then enable a look up of the user s tastes and preference in order to establish a match for an advertisement placement to the user s browser. In this example the user s taste and preference profile may indicate that the user enjoys traveling to New England likes to camp has a family with children and the like. As a result the advertisement facility associated with the website may select an advertisement that utilizes the information in the user query in this instance hiking boots and information from their taste and preference profile. An advertisement in this case may be for lodging in the White Mountains which combines the user s hiking boot query with their preference for travel in New England. Further the lodging may be a family lodging because of the user likes to travel as a family and with attributes that mirror the user s preferences. In embodiments the third party taste and preference API may enable a third party to improve their targeting of advertisements to users such that they are able to increase revenue made on a given advertisement placement from an advertisement sponsor. In embodiments the user taste and preference profile may be developed in real time as focused on their immediate query. Tastes and preferences may be gleaned so as to better target advertisements to the user such as during subsequent refinement of product search at the point of purchase and the like.

In embodiments advertising may be targeted to a user or a group of individuals associated with the user based on taste and preferences inferred though the user s social network. For instance a taste and preference API used by a third party may be used to establish taste and preferences for a group node cluster and the like such as in a user s social network. In embodiments the tastes and preferences inferred from the social network may utilize taste and preference profiles previously formed such as though third part sites or through a facility directly associated with the present invention. These taste and preferences may then be used to better target advertisements to the user or to members of the user s social network. In an example a third party may want to target advertisement to a user where the user has an established taste and preference profile stored in a facility of the present invention. The third party may then use information in the user s profile to target advertisements. Alternately the third party may additionally use information inferred from a social network that the user is part of such as information pertaining to the topics of the social network common interests of users associated with the user in the social network and the like. For instance the user may have a taste and preference profile that indicates they are middle aged politically conservative rural and the like and is associated with users in a social network that have hunting as a dominate interest. In this instance the third party may target advertisements for hunting equipment hunting trips and the like where the advertisement has been selected based on the user s existing taste and preference profile plus inferences from the user s social network. In embodiments this may be done without the need to engage the user in a dialog as described herein but rather indirectly through the user s interactions such as on the third party website through third party supplied information on other websites where the present invention has a third party API and the like. In embodiments the third party may also utilize the taste and preferences from the user to target advertisements to other members of the user s social network.

In embodiments advertising to a user may be targeted based on the product choices recommendations and the like of users with similar tastes and preferences. For example a first user may have similar tastes and preferences to a second user where the first user has an existing taste and preference profile and has made certain product choices recommendations and the like. Advertisements may then be targeted to the second user based on the decisions of the first user. For example a first user may have a profile that indicates they are older retired lives in California enjoys travel and the like where they have previously made a product choice for luggage. A second user may then be provided a recommendation for similar luggage based on the similarity of the tastes and preferences of two users. In embodiments this may be executed without the need to engage either of the users in a dialog.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps target advertising to a user through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of the user as applied to a market of a third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the market of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and store them as a user preference profile 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website associated with the market of the third party and 5 providing an advertisement to the user wherein the advertisement is based on the ascertained preferences of the user. In embodiments the determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The advertisement may be provided by the computer facility. The advertisement may be provided through the third party and enabled through preferences provided to the third party from the computer facility. The API may enable the collection of at least one of cost information product information personal information and topical information. The decision may be also based on information inferred from a user s social network. An advertisement may be delivered to other users associated with the user such as through a social network.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to provide users with reviews from similar users where the user and similar users may not have engaged in a dialog or interacting directly with the computing facility of the present invention. For instance the taste and preference API may enable the present invention to collect taste and preference information for the user provide the third party with taste and preference information for the user from a previously established taste and preference profile provide the third party with taste and preference information for the user based on near term actions of the user and the like. In embodiments the user may have never interacted with a facility of the present invention where a user s taste and preference profile may be created and updated through the user s interactions responses recommendations reviews and the like. In embodiments the system may learn about a known user s taste profile though their rating things they like and don t like or through the use of natural language processing such as inferring a taste profile by analyzing how the user tags their user profile. In this case similar users may have a previously established taste and preference profile and as such may have a taste and preference profile that may be matched to the user. In addition these similar users may have reviews associated with their profile. The system may now match the user to a similar user and then provide the user with the associated review. For instance a user may have an existing taste and preference profile with the system such as directly with the computer facility or though at least one third party API and may want to know what other similar users thought of some product service person event and the like. The system may then search the taste and preference profiles for similar users on the subject the present user has interest in. In this way the system may now be able to provide reviews and such to the present user from similar users and thus helping the present user determine what they may want to do based on their tastes and preferences. For example a user may go to a product website that utilizes the taste and preference API of the present invention and is interested in reviews for digital cameras. The third party may now find similar users and then search for digital camera reviews by those similar users and provide the reviews to the current user. In embodiments the reviews may be resident at a third party facility at another third party facility at a facility of the present invention and the like. In embodiments the ability to show reviews of similar users may allow the user to access more relevant reviews in a more time efficient manner and the third party user of the API may be able to provide more targeted and relevant support to their users.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to provide users with reviews from similar users where the users are determined to be similar without the similar users participating in a dialog through the present invention. For instance the similar user may be identified as being similar through a social network friend family work and the like. In an example a user may be associated with a second user though a social network and through this association determined to be similar such as though age interests and the like. The similar user may then provide a review such as for a product an activity and the like. This review may then be provided to the user as relevant though the similarity to the other user. In embodiments similar users may be determined through similar recommendations on other topics such as in combination with other factors where the other factors may be a social association.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a user find reviews of similar users through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of the user wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 collecting preferences of a plurality of users wherein the plurality of users includes the user 3 storing the preferences of the user in a taste and preference database which contains a plurality of taste and preference profiles 4 receiving a request from the user through a third party taste and preference learning API for a topical review from a user who has similar taste and preferences 5 matching the preferences of the user to at least one other user s preference in the taste and preference database 6 searching for a review related to the request for the topical review from amongst the matched other users and 7 providing the review to the user. In embodiments the determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The review may be found within the computer facility a facility of the third party and the like. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The preference learning API may enable the collection of cost information product information personal information topical information and the like. The review may be provided by a similar user that has no taste and preference profile where the user may be similar as determined though a social association where the social association may be a social network.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to recommend products services and the like. For instance a user may come to a third party website in search of a recommendation for a product and the third party may then utilize the taste and preference API to better understand what the user typically prefers and from that preference suggest a product. In an example the user may come to an audio store website looking for a recommendation for an audio system for playing music from their iPhone. The third party may then utilize existing taste and preferences for the user through the API. In this example the tastes and preferences of the user may indicate that they are a collage student and often on the run in their social life. From this information the third party may now make recommendations such as recommendations for audio systems that are portable small powerful and the like. Alternately the third party may use the taste and preference API to determine their taste and preferences at the time of the user inquiry such as targeted to the inquiry content of the third party for the user in general and the like. The third party may use this new taste and preference information alone or in combination with previous tastes and preference profiles through the present invention to make the recommendations. The taste and preferences as established through the third party may now be stored in a facility of the present invention such as to be used again or in combination with new taste and preference profiles generated through other third party APIs or directly through a facility of the present invention. In embodiments the ability to use the taste and preference API may improve the recommendations for products services and the like that are made through third party sites.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to recommend products services and the like to a user based on the actions of similar users. For instance two users may have previously established taste and preference profiles with the present invention where one of the users has selected a product service or the like and where third party may now provide a recommendation to the other user based on their similarity such as determined through their profiles. In an example two users may have been determined to be similar through their taste and preference profiles such as by their age location political views social activities and the like. The first user may then select a product such as a car. In the event that the second similar user should indicate an interest in a car such as through searching advertisement selection explicit question to the present invention and the like the present invention may provide the car selection to the second user as a potential fit because of their similarities. In embodiments this may be done without a dialog provided to one or both users.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a user find a recommendation through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of the user as applied to the products and services of the third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the products and services of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and storing them as a user preference profile wherein the source of the collecting is from user interactions on the Internet 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website associated with at least one of products and services of the third party and 5 providing a recommendation for at least one of the product and service to the user from the computing facility wherein the recommendation is based on the query and the ascertained preferences of the user. In embodiments the determining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The collecting may be from the third party website on the Internet a plurality of third party websites on the Internet at least one of recommendations purchases and search result choices made by the user and the like. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The third party information may consist of product information from product manufacturers product information from web merchants pricing information from other websites availability information from other websites pricing information from merchants availability information from merchants a review comments ratings and the like. The API may enable the collection of cost information product information personal information topical information and the like. The preferences may be derived from an action of a second similar user where the similarity may be determined through a taste and preference profile for the user and second similar user. The action of a second similar user may be a selection of at least one of product and service.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third party social network sites may use to show a user people that are similar to them on the social network. These similar people may be shown as a list as photos by region by age by gender and the like. For instance the user may come to a social network site and ask to see or be connected to people who are similar to them. The social network site may then utilize the taste and preference API to provide the user with a dialog to determine their tastes and preferences such as in general to social situations to social networking to activities to music to personality and the like. Alternately the user may already have a taste and preferences profile as determined directly by a facility of the present invention through another third party API though the social network site and the like. The social network may then use this information to match the user to other people on the social network such as through taste and preference profiles of the other people as previously determined through information available about the other people as available through the social network and the like. For example the user s taste and preference may indicate that they are young and enjoy going to clubs in the NYC. The social networking site may now be able to match the user to similar people on the social network such as by list photograph by category by region of the city and the like. In embodiments the taste and preference API with a social network may provide an enhanced matching experience to the user who is trying to find other similar people to be social with.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a user find other similar users on a social networking site through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 receiving an initial request from a user through a third party social networking site API wherein the initial request is to find other similar users to them on the social network 2 ascertaining preferences of the user through the social networking site API 3 matching the user preferences to other users on the social network with users with similar preferences and 4 providing a matching result to the user that includes the other users that match user s preference. In embodiments the ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The matching result may be presented to the user as a list of the similar users. The matching result may be presented to the user as a profile of the similar users. The matching result may be presented to the user as links to the similar users within the social network. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third party searching facilities may use to rank search results based on which results similar users selected the most. For instance the searching facility may offer users the opportunity to improve the relevancy of how the search results are listed through a tastes and preference profile as provided through the taste and preference API of the present invention. A taste and preference profile database or the like may then be accumulated and maintained from which the searching facility may rank search results for the user to previously selected results by other similar users. In an example a user may have a taste and preference profile that shows a retired male who likes to sail and is a bit adventurous. When the user searches for Caribbean vacation destinations the searching facility may rank the search results with these taste and preference attributes listed first such as for sailboat rental packages in the islands hiking in the islands off beat destinations and the like. In embodiments the use of a taste and preference API provided to a searching facility may improve the relevancy of ranked search results to the user.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps rank search results through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 receiving a search request from a user through a third party searching facility 2 ascertaining preferences of the user wherein the ascertained preferences from the user creates a taste and preference profile for the user and is stored in a taste and preference storage facility which includes a plurality of other user taste and preference profiles where the profiles also contain a history of search results selected by the other users in previous searches 3 matching the user to other users with similar taste and preference profiles 4 determining a search result set for the user s search request 5 matching the search result set to the history of search results selected by the other users with similar taste and preference profiles and 6 providing the search results to the user wherein the search results are ranked according to the matched results selected by the other users with similar taste and preference profiles. In embodiments the ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The searching facility may be a search engine.

Referring to the present invention may utilize social graphs to infer the taste and preferences for an unknown user by finding paths through an Internet based social interactive construct to people with known taste preferences. In this way the present invention may provide a way to get data for a user that the system has never heard of before. In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps determine an unknown user s preferences through the use of internet based social interactive graphical representations on a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 ascertaining preferences of a plurality of users who are part of an internet based social interactive construct wherein the plurality of users become a plurality of known users 2 determining the internet based social interactive graphical representation for the plurality of known users and 3 inferring the preferences of an unknown user present in the internet based social interactive graphical representation of the plurality of known users based on the interrelationships between the unknown user and the plurality of known users within the graphical representation . In embodiments the Internet based social interactive graphical representation may be a social network a social graph a social diagram and the like. The unknown user may be three degrees five degrees and the like away from the closest known user in the internet based social interactive graphical representation. The inferred preferences of the unknown user may make the unknown user a new known user and the new known user may be used to contribute to the inferring of the preferences of a second unknown user. The preferences may include personal information topical information and the like related to interactions of the user where the interactions may be through the internet based social interactive graphical representation. The interactions may be through an API provided to a third party website. The inferring may be provided in conjunction with other known users that are related to the user in the user s internet based social interactive construct. The ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The inferred preferences may be used to target advertising to the unknown user to share reviews with the unknown user. The inferred preferences may be used to recommend products services and the like to the unknown user. The inferred preferences may be used to aid in ranking search results for the unknown user. Known users that are in close proximity to the unknown user may carry more weight in an inferring algorithm. The inferred preferences may be refined by information from other sources where the other sources may include third party sources recommendations made by the plurality of known users search queries by the plurality of known users search result selections one of the plurality of known users personal tastes as determined through web interactions by at least one of the plurality of known users and the like. The other sources may include a third party preference learning API.

In embodiments the present invention may utilize social network graphs diagrams graphical representations and the like to infer the taste and preferences for an unknown user by finding paths through a social network to people with known taste or visa versa. Social diagrams are generally speaking the mapping of a plurality of users and how they are related. By using the social diagram a taste and preference of a known and unknown user may be determined from their interrelation within the diagram. For instance a user with a known taste and preference profile may be directly associated with a plurality other users such as represented in a social diagram. To a first approximation it may be assumed that these plurality of other users are similar to the user and so have similar taste and preferences. These other users may then be provided refined services that take advantage of knowing a users taste and preference such as described herein. For example provided with a user with a known taste and preference profile indicating they are a rock climber it may be assumed that users within a first link of the user s social diagram are also rock climbers. In reality this may prove to be too general an assumption. However it may be a good assumption that the user does have associations with other rock climbers and so the system may go out through the social diagram searching for other known users that enjoy rock climbing. In this example it may be found there is another known user such as three links away that also enjoys rock climbing and this user is found in a cluster that connects to the first user. From this it may be a good assumption that this cluster is a group of rock climbers and rock climbers may all share a set of similar tastes and preferences with each other. In embodiments tastes and preferences may be inferred from associations within a social network diagram and as such may be provided benefits from the present invention as described herein.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps determine an unknown user s tastes and preference through the use of social network graphical representations on a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 ascertaining preferences of the user wherein the user becomes a known user 2 determine the social network graphical representation for the known user 3 determine the presence to other known users within the known user s social network graphical representation and 4 infer the preferences of an unknown user present in the known user s social network graphical representation based on the interrelationships between the unknown user and the known user and other known users within the network graphical representation. In embodiments the ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The social network graphical representation may be a social graph a social diagram and the like. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility.

In embodiments the present invention may combine the tastes and preferences of a user as determined through two or more third party API to improve recommendations provided through the two or more third party API. For instance there may be taste and preference profiles being established through more than a single third party API and by combining these different tastes and preference profiles by the present invention a combined taste and preference profile may be generated. Further as additional taste and preference profiles are created through third party API they may be used to continuously update the combined taste and preference profile for a user. The third parties may then utilize the combined taste and preference profile to improve their recommendations. This may especially be the case when different third parties focus taste and preference profiling on different areas such as products personal relationships services celebrities and the like. It can be appreciated that combining a number of more specific profiles into a combined profile may provide a richer taste and preference profile then could be generated through any one of the more specific profiles. In addition a user may change their tastes and preferences over time and so combining more recent user profile interactions on one third party API may benefit another third party that the user has not interacted with in recent time but where the other third party wants to keep their user profiles up to date.

Referring to in embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers provides improved taste and preference profiling through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 creating a first taste and preference profile of a user through the user s interactions with a first third party website through a first preference learning third party API 2 collecting additional user interaction information through a second third party website through a second third party API and 3 combining the additional user interaction information with the taste and preference profile to improve the taste and preference profile . In embodiments creating a first taste and preference profile may be through the ascertaining of user preferences through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The API may enable the collection of at least one of cost information product information personal information and topical information.

Referring to in embodiments graph constructs may be developed and or utilized by a web based advice facility such as to aid in providing recommendations to users through a dialog with the user across the Internet with a minimized amount of dialog with a user to provide recommendations to users where the graph constructs augment the process that leads to the recommendation where the use of the graph construct eliminates the need to carry on a dialog with the user to form recommendations to users and the like. In embodiments graph constructs may be developed through information from third party sites . In embodiments there may be a plurality of types of nodes in the graph such as people entities tags and the like. For instance people may be users of websites applications mobile devices shoppers in a store anonymous web browsers represented purely by a unique cookie id and the like. Entities may be things that people like dislike buy search for research and the like. Tags may be short textual descriptions of entities people and the like. In embodiments nodes in the graph may be connected by a plurality of types of edges such as for preference data tagging data and the like. For instance entities may be connected to people nodes by preference edges that express the degree to which a person likes or dislikes that entity. Tags may be connected to people and entity nodes by whether those people or entities are tagged with those tags.

In embodiments graph data may be explicitly given by users e.g. user A says they like thing B crawled from publicly available web sites provided by third party sources and the like. Once data is received the system may attempt to alias it to existing data in the system. For example if the data tells the system that user A likes restaurant B then the system attempts to identify what if anything is already known about restaurant B through things like matching names addresses phone numbers and other information. This may allow the system to aggregate data such as training data from multiple sources all against the same entity representing restaurant B . The system may perform aliasing against users. For example user jsmith99 might be the same user as john smith on two different websites. The system may use similarity of usernames email addresses pictures full first and last names geographic location and the like to correlate users across different web sites and identity systems.

In embodiments nodes in the graph may have a taste profile such as with a numerical quantity. A person may be predicted to like or dislike an entity or tag based on their taste profiles. Similarly two people may be predicted to be similar or dissimilar based on their taste profiles. Entities may also be compared to see how similar they are to each other using their taste profiles. The system s graph may initially have taste profiles assigned to some nodes and then propagate those taste profiles to the nodes that don t have taste profiles. This propagation may be an iterative process that flows taste profiles from nodes that have profiles into nodes that do not have profiles. Alternatively the iteration may update the profile of nodes that already have a profile based on neighboring nodes profiles. New data may be incorporated into the graph by adding new nodes or edges and then updating the new or changed node purely using neighboring nodes profiles. Alternatively the system may run multiple iterations of updates across the entire graph.

Many different kinds of data may be fit into being viewed as a like or dislike . For example viewing a web page can be represented in the graph as an edge with a weak connection between the person viewing the web page and an entity representing the web page. Someone buying a book can be represented by an edge making a strong connection between the person buying the book and the book itself. Someone answering a question that has three mutually exclusive answers can be represented as an edge between the person and an entity representing the answer they gave as well as two negative edges to the two answers the user did not give.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for recommendations to users based on the degree to which a recommendation may be new interesting and the like which will herein be referred to as interestingness . In embodiments interestingness may be a combination of being an interesting subject topic product and the like as well as how new or revived the idea is. In an illustrative example the user may live in the U.S. and be interested in cooking Italian food and so the system may provide cooking recommendations to the user. In this instance recommending a new cheese flavor to try as Parmesan Cheese may have a low interestingness because the use of Parmesan Cheese in the U.S. may not be new at all and even be rather over used. Alternatively Pecorino cheese is an Italian cheese made from sheep s milk and can be used instead of Parmesan cheese on pasta dishes and is sometimes preferable if a sharper taste is desired. As such a recommendation to substitute Parmesan with Pecorino may be considered to have a high interestingness at least in a relative sense to that of Parmesan. Interestingness may be determined relative to what is standard or typical relative to a past recommendation relative to a novel factor and the like. In this instance the interestingness of Pecorino may be rated high relative to the interestingness of Parmesan.

In embodiments interestingness may be correlated to a known taste profile and fresh to the user where fresh may mean new such as new to the world absent from a user s own past experience such as by reference to a known history of the user and the like. Alternately fresh may not necessarily be new to the world or to the user but be a new fact or story associated with something that makes it interesting anew. For example Chipotle on 21st street may not be new or interesting but if someone provides a recommendation to Get a burrito at Chipotle where Oprah gets her burritos then it s interesting. The system may encourage this by requiring users to write a reason as to why they are recommending something. Interestingness may be determined as related to the ratio of users rating the item to the item being saved by users. For instance if there is a bookmark save for later add to wish list and the like functionality e.g. a star rating functionality it may be seen that there is a correlation between highly rated items that are low saved items as not being interesting. In this instance it could be that everyone knows about the items so they can rate them but they re not worth saving for later thus not interesting. Alternately an item that is highly rated and often saved by users may be considered interesting because the item is both highly regarded i.e. highly rated and worth saving for further consideration. Interestingness may be an acceleration of social activity. For example there may be a restaurant that has been around forever and that the user knows about but which on a sunny weekend suddenly starts getting a lot more foursquare.com check ins. This may be a sign there s something interesting going on there now. In embodiments the advice facility may also determine that something is new or new to the user by looking at release dates of books movies albums products and the like and take the earliest date the item is found on the Internet to determine its interestingness look at the date of the first review written for something on the web look at events such as movie releases concerts author talks and the like that may be considered inherently new and the like. The advice facility may also ask the user to rate things they already know about where the system may assume that items user s haven t rated are new to them. The advice facility may have a save feature to encourage users to use when they don t know about something yet but want to check it out.

Thus it will be understood that interestingness as that term is used herein may include or more concretely be quantitatively evaluated according to relevance in the conventional sense particularly as it relates to the relationship between a user s profile or taste profile and new content. A wide variety of analytical mathematical rule based and or heuristic techniques are known for evaluating relevance any of which may be usefully adapted to determining relevance and more generally interestingness as contemplated herein. However interestingness additionally includes dynamic relationships between a user and content based on e.g. time location user history and so on.

Time for example may be important simply as a measure of newness such as where a current statistic is more interesting than an older measurement of the same statistic. Conversely where a user expresses interest in a particular point in time or period in history older statistics facts opinions and the like having an explicit time as determined by metadata content chronology or the like may be more interesting. Newness that is a measure of how recent an item is may be particularly important to interestingness where there are numerous diverging items of information on a topic and there is a measurable increase in the current popularity of or interest in particular ones of the diverging items. This type of popularity may be measured in numerous ways such as passive measurements of blogging activity newly indexed web content or any other Internet based measurement of user interest as well as active measurements of hits traffic or other activity at web servers as well as group or individual monitoring of client activity. Time may also be important to interestingness of an item in other contexts such as where time is explicit or implicit in a user inquiry e.g. things to do this weekend movies showing this evening etc.

Location may also significantly impact interestingness. This may include simple geographic proximity using any suitable location aware technologies and may incorporate other aspects of a user profile such as an interest in particular venues e.g. food art entertainment or a current activity associated with a user. However it will be understood that this may also include location related items such as inferences about the convenience of adjacent locations through various transportation alternatives available to the user e.g. a car public transportation etc. as well as a user s available budget for immediate or extended travel planning. In addition the context of a location and its corresponding interestingness may depend on other dynamic location attributes such as the location of friends within a social network and the proximity to or distance from geographic concentrations of the same.

User history may also be used to parameterize interestingness. For example where a new item is responsive to a user inquiry or well matched to a user profile but highly distinct from previous content obtained by a user this distinctiveness may make the item more quantitatively interesting even if the calculated relevance is equal to or less than relevance of other results. Thus in one aspect interestingness may depend concurrently on measures of similarity or relevance or the like and dissimilarity or more specifically characteristics that make an item dissimilar to previous content in a user s history. Alternatively an item of information may rank poorly on a general measure of relevance that is de emphasized based on other aspects of the user s current context. Thus interestingness may provide a measure of relevance to a user based on any suitable similarity or matching metric that is further augmented by a newness to a user as explicitly measured through a dissimilarity to information in a user s history or any objective basis for adapting relevance scoring based on the user s context. In one aspect interestingness may be objectively measured as relevance based on a user s profile along with dissimilarity to a user s history and one or more aspects of a user s current context such as time or location. As measured in this manner many objectively highly relevant items may not be particularly interesting to a user while marginally relevant items may be highly interesting.

Referring to recommendations may be provided through a recommendation facility as part of a web based advice facility . In embodiments the recommendation facility may utilize interestingness filtering in the process of generating recommendations to a user . Recommendations sources may include friends similar users influential people source websites and the like. Recommendations may be provided to the user through the Internet through a telecommunications facility e.g. cell phone network and the like.

In embodiments the determination of interestingness may be related to social activity of other individuals e.g. friends famous people an authoritative person the born on date of a product place event e.g. the opening of a restaurant the release of a movie a new product and the like. The social activity of other individuals may be related to individuals influential to the user such as friends highly rating a topic friends with similar tastes highly rating a topic non friends who are influential highly rating a topic non friends who have similar tastes in this topic highly rating it and the like. These other individuals may fall into different categories such as friends people the user doesn t necessarily know but whom have similar tastes in this topic people who don t necessarily have the same tastes as the user but who are famous prolific well known critics in this topic e.g. movie reviewers and the like. The system may also note which of the user s friends have similar tastes to them in this specific topic. For example if Ted has similar restaurant tastes to the user but Alice does not then a restaurant may be interesting to the user if Ted likes it but not necessarily interesting if Alice likes it. Other reasons that something may be considered interesting for the user are if a friend has saved the recommendation for later if friends are commenting and discussing the recommendation actively and the like.

In embodiments recommendations may be provided to users through email social networks third party sites when the user requests as a data feed as a push service on a periodic basis in association with a search topic related to a current geographic location to a home computer to a mobile computer to a mobile communications facility e.g. cell phone smart phone PDA and the like. For example the user may be provided interestingness recommendations to their mobile phone based on their current geographic location such as product recommendations to stores in the area e.g. products on sale new products products that are difficult to get places to see restaurants to try and the like where the recommendations are based on interestingness. In this way the user doesn t just receive recommendations but rather a more interesting set of recommendations which may increase the chances that the user will be interested in the recommendation such as in a discovery of a new idea place product and the like. And when the discovery is associated with a particular genre becomes a local discovery a restaurant discovery a technology discovery a cooking discovery and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide local discovery to a user where local discovery may include providing new and interesting things to the user instead of relying on the user typing something into a search box or otherwise pulling search results to them. This may be especially useful for mobile devices where typing is more difficult such as when a device input is input constrained e.g. small keyboard small display the user being mobile walking driving and the like . Although the description of local discovery herein is provided primarily with respect to a mobile device application one skilled in the art will appreciate that it may be implemented on any computing facility such as a laptop desktop navigation device or the like. Local discovery functionality may also be available through a web interface through emails of new stuff for the user through Twitter through posting to blogging platforms e.g. Wordpress Tumblr etc and the like. Further local discovery content may be provided to a user upon request transmitted to the user e.g. email to push new interesting things to a user e.g. weekly and the like.

In embodiments a mobile device local discovery application may show the user places nearby such as that they ve rated in the application in the past that their friends have rated that people with similar taste as the user have rated that authoritative sources have rated that famous people have rated and the like where rating may be an inferred recommendation from behaviors e.g. online or off line of the person. In embodiments the places that get shown may be restaurants bars boutiques hotels and the like. There may also be a navigational element to let the user filter down to narrower lists such as for example Italian Restaurants that are nearby or at a specified location such as recommended by others.

Besides showing places local discovery may also show the user items to buy events to go to things to look at such as if they have some time to kill and the like. For example local discovery might provide a list of recommended books the user might want to read and optionally show where to buy them locally. Local discovery might select the items provide recommendations and the like based on machine learning such as what the user s friends have liked recently what people with similar tastes in books have liked recently what popular prominent critics have liked recently and the like or just what is popular overall or popular near the user. Similarly this also applies to other kinds of products events to go to and the like.

In embodiments local discovery may find people with similar tastes in each area restaurants books etc and then let the user follow the things they rate. When using the mobile application local discovery may use the user s location to filter down lists of things people similar to the user like near by. Local discovery may determine whether another person has similar taste as the user through machine learning asking both to rate various places and things asking both to answer questions to gauge similarity and the like. Local discovery such as though the advice facility may then try to validate similarity between the user and another person such as based on liking obscure things in common disliking popular things in common showing written reviews that the other person has written describing the other person s traits demographics location etc showing how many other people follow the other user and the like.

In embodiments instead of producing a list of recommended places things or events for a given area local discovery may also produce a discovery feed of interesting stuff for the user such as with a high interestingness rating. This may mean that instead of seeing the same ten restaurants recommended every time the user looks near their office they may see a few different results each day show up. Ideally these new restaurants may be showing up based on the user s friends or people with similar tastes liking some new place near you but it may also be a partially editorial process where staff members associated with the implementation of a local discovery application are constantly finding new places and sending them out to the user base.

In embodiments the user may also save things to a wish list to do list and the like for using later. This saved list of products places events and the like may then also be used to alert the user about deals availability new reviews and the like about those products places and events so as to only alert the user about stuff they re interested in. For example it might be annoying if the user s phone vibrated to tell them some shoes were available at a store they were walking by unless they had previously indicated they wanted those shoes on their wishlist .

In embodiments the user interface for a local discovery application may be a map a textual list a cover flow like interface for flipping through such as in Apple Computer s implementation of cover flow and the like. The interface may also send alerts to the user when a friend or someone with similar taste likes something nearby likes something that the user has saved to their wish list and the like.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with the weather where the application may in part determine recommendations based on actual or predicted weather in the area the person wants a recommendation in. For example the application may recommend places with great outdoor seating when the weather is warm and not raining recommend things to do outdoors when the weather is good provide more weight to recommendations for going to a museum when the weather is bad and the like.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with the time of day such as taking the hours of operation and the distance to the place into account when making recommendations. For example if the person wants a place to eat now the system may not recommend a place that is closed or about to close. Similarly the system wouldn t recommend things to do that have sold out already that will not be reachable in time using estimated transportation time to reach them and the like.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with taste such as using a person s taste when making recommendations instead of just showing what s popular among users nearby. In embodiments taste may be inferred through the things the user likes the people they follow on social networks and the like such as described herein.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with location such as using the person s location when making recommendations use their location when offering the user a list of topics they can get a recommendation in and the like. For example if there are no hair salons near by the system would not offer the user the choice of getting recommendations about hair salons. Similarly if there are no Mexican restaurants or video game stores the system would not offer the choice of recommendations in those topics. If the user s location is inside a store the system wouldn t offer recommendations about topics the store is out of or does not sell.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with social activity such as showing recommendations that have received some amount of activity from friends from respected authorities in the topic from people with similar tastes as the user and the like.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with recommendations that are interesting in that they are new newly popular have received social activity have an indication that they are not new but also not popular enough that the user is likely to already know about them and the like such has described herein in terms of interestingness.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with what items a user saves on their mobile device such as when a person using a mobile application may save for later interesting recommendations as well as things they see in stores or while out walking around. For example if they see a book they like in a book store they may scan the bar code and save it for later. If they see a restaurant they like they may take a picture and capture their location such as via GPS and save it for later. Saved content may then be the basis of recommendations used in a mobile application later on or the content may be sent to the user through other channels such as a weekly email reminder through a web application and the like. Saving may also be used by the system as a social indicator such as to indicate that something is interesting content for other users.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with what items a user saves on the Internet. This may be similar to saving on a mobile device itself where the user may save content they find on the web and then use it later through their mobile application. For instance if the user sees a book review and saves it for later they may then be reminded about it later when they use their mobile device to look for book recommendations. Similarly they may save a restaurant or thing to do and later be reminded about it on their mobile device.

In embodiments a local discovery application may be associated with displaying topics to offer recommendations in such as displaying a grid of pictures when the mobile application first starts representing the topics that recommendations are available in. The choice may be based on the user s location their historic use of the application and the like where the application predicts what the user is interested in. For example there might be pictures of restaurants iPhone apps and video games among others when the application starts based on their being recommended restaurants near the user and the application s belief that the user is interested in iPhone apps and video games. The actual pictures may be picked based on the application s knowledge of the user. For example the picture for the restaurants topic may be a picture of a restaurant nearby that the application predicts the user may like. The size and sorting of the pictures may be based on how interested the application predicts the user will be in that topic so that the user s most frequently used topics are at the top of the list and shown with the biggest picture such as shown in . The user may then select one of the recommendations and be linked to more detailed information associated with the recommendation such as shown in .

In embodiments recommendations may be displayed as the images with an ordering as a function of interest to the user such as in an irregular grid where the left right top to bottom ordering is based on how much the system thinks the user will be interested in each recommendation or each topic. For example as shown in the system has predicted that the user is more interested in restaurants than coffee shops and so the restaurants tile is listed before the coffee shop tile. Also the content of each tile is a recommendation in that topic that the user may like. So the restaurant tile shows a restaurant the user may like that is near them the movie tile shows a movie the music may like etc.

Turning now to a recommendation system includes a matrix generation module a prediction module and a ratings database . The modules of the recommendation system may be implemented on a single device such as a recommendation device or on separate devices interconnected via a network. The modules of the recommendation system may be implemented on for example the machine learning facility illustrated in and the computing facility illustrated in the machine learning engine illustrated in the third party website illustrated in the third party website illustrated in the first and second third party website illustrated in web based advice facility illustrated in web based advice facility illustrated in and so forth.

According to various exemplary embodiments the recommendation system may provide recommendations regarding different items to different users. The recommendation system may provide such recommendations by predicting a presently unknown affinity between a particular user and a particular item based on some number of known affinities between that particular user and other items and or based on some number of known affinities between other users and that particular item or other items. The term affinity as used throughout this disclosure refers to a liking attraction preference interest etc. that a particular user may harbor for a particular item. The affinity may be determined based on information known about the user or people similar to the user or may be received from the user. The affinity may be a potential affinity that is predicted by the recommendation system or another entity. Instead the affinity may be an actual or known affinity that is confirmed by the user or by user behavior such as for example an affinity associated with a user and an item that is be determined based on input received from the user in connection with the item . Once the recommendation system predicts an affinity between a particular user and a particular item the system may make recommendation regarding the particular item to the particular user based on the predicted affinity.

According to various exemplary embodiments the matrix generation module may access or receive affinity ratings information and generate a ratings matrix based on such affinity ratings information. The ratings matrix may include various matrix values that correspond to affinity ratings where each of the affinity ratings describe a degree of affinity between or associated with one of various users and one of various items. For example each affinity rating in the ratings matrix may be a number from 0 to 1 where 0 represents a complete dislike of the item by the user i.e. a low affinity between user and item and a 1 represents that the user really likes the item i.e. a high affinity between user and item .

The matrix generation module may access or receive affinity ratings information from for example the ratings database . The affinity ratings information may identify various users and known affinities e.g. likes or dislikes each user may have for one or more items. illustrates non limiting examples of affinity ratings information the matrix generation module may receive or access. For example table is an exemplary data structure that may store affinity ratings information indicating various product items such as smartphone tablet lemonade etc. and a list of users that have a high affinity for that item i.e. users that like that item as well as a list of users that have a low affinity for that item i.e. users that do not like that item . For example as illustrated in table the smartphone item is liked by the user George but is not liked by the user Miguel and so forth. Table is an exemplary data structure that stores a different type of affinity ratings information indicating various users such as George Miguel etc. and a list of items for which that user has a high affinity i.e. items that the user likes as well as a list of items for which that user has a low affinity i.e. items that the user does not like . For example as illustrated in table the user George likes the smartphone item and tablet item but does not like the scooter item etc. As described in this disclosure the term item refers to any product item object location service retail category area of interest activity hobby a webpage an advertisement media content etc. that may be associated with a user.

Such affinity ratings information and or such tables or data structures storing such affinity ratings information illustrated in may be stored in for example the ratings database illustrated in . Such affinity ratings information may be obtained in various ways and from various sources. For example the affinity ratings information may reflect a high affinity rating associated with a user and an item because that user purchased that item searched for that item submitted a request for that item attempted to access information associated with that item and so forth. As another example when a system such as machine learning facility illustrated in provides a decision to a user in the decision may be a recommendation for an item such as an smartphone or a scooter and the user may provide feedback to the machine learning facility in . If the feedback indicates that the user found the recommendation helpful then the affinity ratings information associated with the user may reflect that the user liked the recommended item or has a high affinity for the recommended item. On the other hand if the feedback indicates that the user did not find the recommendation helpful then the affinity ratings information associated with the user may reflect that the user did not like the recommended item or that the user has a low affinity for the recommended item. Thus the affinity ratings information may be generated by a machine learning facility e.g. machine learning facility illustrated in or recommendation system .

While the exemplary affinity ratings information of indicates that the user either liked or disliked the corresponding item it should be understood that the affinity ratings information may reflect a range of affinity ratings associated with the particular user and the particular item. For example the affinity ratings information may indicate a number from 0 to 1 where 0 represents a complete dislike of the item by the person and a 1 represents that the person absolutely loves the item. Other schemes for indicating a degree of affinity harbored by a user may be utilized will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

After the matrix generation module receives or accesses the affinity ratings information the matrix generation module generates a ratings matrix based on such affinity ratings information. For example illustrates an example of ratings matrix R generated based on the exemplary affinity ratings information of . Ratings matrix R is a k j matrix i.e. a matrix having k rows and j columns and includes affinity ratings that each indicate a degree affinity associated with one of various users and one of various items. In particular each of the k rows of ratings matrix R i.e. rows k k identifies a particular user e.g. George Robert etc. and includes known affinity ratings associated that user e.g. ratings r r and r associated with the user George . Each of the j columns of ratings matrix R i.e. rows j j identifies a particular item e.g. smartphone tablet etc. and includes known affinity ratings associated that particular item e.g. ratings r and r associated with the lemonade item . The affinity ratings represented by r r etc. may correspond to for example a number from 0 to 1 where 0 represents a complete dislike of the item by the user and a 1 represents that the user absolutely loves the item. Thus any particular entry at a specific row k and column j in ratings matrix R is configured to include an affinity rating describing a degree of affinity associated with the user of the corresponding row k and the item of the corresponding column j and wherein such an affinity rating indicates a degree of affinity that the particular user has for the particular item. For example the affinity rating r at row k and column j in ratings matrix R is associated with the user Robert of the corresponding row k and associated with the item lemonade of the corresponding column j and wherein such an affinity rating r indicates a degree of affinity that Robert has for lemonade.

As illustrated in many cells in the ratings matrix J may be missing such as in the case when an affinity rating for a particular combination of person and item is unknown. For example the affinity rating associated with user Miguel and the tablet item is not known and thus the corresponding cell of the ratings matrix J at row k and column j is missing. Thus the ratings matrix R may include at least one missing entry representing an unknown affinity rating associated with a specific user and a specific item.

The affinity predication module is configured to find a new matrix R that has no missing entries. That is the prediction module is configured to receive ratings matrix R which has one or more known affinity ratings as well as one or more missing affinity ratings and generate a revised matrix R that includes predicted affinity ratings in place of the missing affinity ratings. Thus revised matrix R includes either a known affinity rating or a predicted affinity rating for every combination of user and item.

To accomplish this the affinity predication module is configured to produce a factorization of ratings matrix R into two complete factor matrices referred to herein as a user matrix U and an item matrix I. For all known affinity ratings at index x y in ratings matrix R R x y dot U x I y . Put another way for every known affinity rating r at a particular row k and column j in the ratings matrix R the dot product of the corresponding row k in user matrix U and corresponding column j in item matrix I produces this affinity rating r.

Moreover if user matrix U and item matrix I are complete matrices with no missing values then the revised ratings matrix R UI i.e. the matrix multiplication product of user matrix U and item matrix I since R UI will have a value for every combination of a user and item in ratings matrix R. Since matrix R has many missing values there are a variety of ways for prediction module to factor matrix R into complete matrices U and I. One example apparent to those skilled in the art is the Singular Value Decomposition SVD technique. This technique along with others attempts to produce a factorization that minimizes some error loss function between R and R and there are many choices for the kernel function that decides the loss function.

In the SVD technique well known by those skilled in the art the singular value decomposition of an m n real or complex matrix M is a factorization of the form M U V where U is an m m real or complex unitary matrix is an m n rectangular diagonal matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal and V the conjugate transpose of V is an n n real or complex unitary matrix. The prediction module is configured to factorize ratings matrix R into user matrix U and item matrix I and thereby generate revised ratings matrix R UI based on the SVD technique.

Moreover there are various ways to compute the SVD factorization as understood by those skilled in the art. One example is computing the SVD by using stochastic gradient descent while another is computing the SVD using Alternating Least Squares ALS . Thus prediction module may compute the SVD of ratings matrix R via stochastic gradient descent computing one column of item matrix I at a time where successive columns are computed. The factorization of a matrix using SVD via stochastic gradient descent is understood by those skilled in the art and will not be described in further detail herein in the interests of brevity.

In the alternating least squares ALS technique an initial choice of values for matrix U and matrix I are made and then a series of updates is made first to matrix U and then to matrix I in order to produce an approximation to matrix R based on matrix R s known values. The updates to matrix U are made by generating a least squares fit solution of UI R solving for matrix U. Then the updates to matrix I are made by generation a least squares fit solution of UI R solving for matrix I. This process is repeated until the magnitude of changes to matrix U and matrix I are below some threshold until a fixed maximum number of steps has been reached or until a variable number of steps is reached based on properties of matrix R. For example if matrix R represents a graph the number of updates may be proportional to the diameter of the graph.

Note that the factors U and V produced by SVD are essentially the same as matrices U and I except that the matrix produced by SVD is multiplied into both U and I in some arbitrary way. As described above SVD is essentially a theorem stating that a matrix can be uniquely factored into U and V and there are many implementations of algorithms for performing that factorization. A true SVD is only specified for dense matrices and algorithms such as the lanczos algorithm are typically used to perform the operation. Given that the original ratings matrix R has missing entries the recommendation system may probabilistically estimate what U and V corresponding to user matrix U and item matrix I might be using algorithms like the well known alternating least squares algorithm technique.

Thus the prediction module is configured to factorize ratings matrix R into user matrix U and item matrix I and thereby generate revised ratings matrix R UI based on the ALS technique. illustrates a revised ratings matrix R generated by the prediction module . Whereas the ratings matrix R illustrated in had one or more missing affinity ratings the revised ratings matrix R includes predicted affinity ratings r r r and r in place of the missing affinity ratings. Thus revised matrix R includes either a known affinity rating or a predicted affinity rating for every combination of user and item. The factorization of a matrix based on ALS is understood by those skilled in the art and will not be described in further detail herein in the interests of brevity.

Based on the predicted affinity ratings the prediction module may provide a recommendation regarding a specific item to a specific user. For example if a predicted affinity rating for a particular user and particular item is 1 then the module may recommend that item to the user whereas if the predicted affinity rating is 0 then the module may not recommend that item to the user.

The ALS process performed by the prediction module for factoring the ratings matrix R into user matrix U and item matrix I to generate revised ratings matrix R may take a significant amount of time on current computer systems. Accordingly there is a potential problem when a new user or new item is to be added to the ratings matrix R in that it may be infeasible to quickly add the new user or the new item to the ratings matrix R and then proceed through the entire ALS process again to factor the new ratings matrix R and to generate a new revised ratings matrix R .

Accordingly in various exemplary embodiments the prediction module may perform an incremental approximate update to add a single new row or column to ratings matrix R without re computing all of user matrix U and item matrix I. For example when a new user needs to be added to the system as happens when a new users signs up at a website or uses a mobile recommendation application such as those described in various exemplary embodiments of this disclosure the prediction module may estimate the user parameters u of the new user for direct insertion into the user matrix U. In particular the prediction module may estimate the user parameters u of the new user by generating a solution e.g. ALS solution of Iu r by solving for u where r are the new user s ratings of some of the existing j items in ratings matrix R.

For example illustrates an example of the same ratings matrix R illustrated in except that a new row k corresponding to a new user Sven has been inserted into the ratings matrix R by the prediction module . The row k identifying the new user Sven includes various known affinity ratings e.g. r r and r where these known ratings describe a degree of affinity associated with the new user Sven and associated with various existing items in columns j j. For example rating r describes a degree of affinity associated with the new user Sven and the smartphone item rating r describes a degree of affinity associated with the new user Sven and the scooter item and so forth. illustrates an example of user matrix U with user parameters u u describing the new user Sven that may be estimated by the prediction module .

In particular the prediction module generates a solution e.g ALS solution of Iu r by solving for u. That is since the item matrix I with item parameters i describing each of the items has already been generated see the prediction module may assume that the product of user parameters u u describing the new user Sven and the item parameters corresponding to a specific item should produce the known affinity rating describing the degree of affinity associated with the user Sven and that specific item. For example prediction module may assume that the product of user parameters u u describing the new user Sven see and the item parameters i i i i i describing the scooter item see will produce the known affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the user Sven and the scooter item see . Thus based on the already generated item matrix I and item parameters i therein and based on all the known affinity ratings r associated with the new user the prediction module generates a solution e.g. AILS solution of Iu r by solving for u in order to estimate the user parameters u of the new user e.g. u u illustrated in and insert them into the user matrix U see .

Moreover according to various exemplary embodiments once the user parameters of the new user are estimated these user parameters may be utilized by the prediction module to estimate missing affinity ratings associated with the new user. For example the prediction module may generate the dot product of the estimated user parameters u u describing user Sven see and the item parameters i i i i and i describing the lemonade item see to produce an estimate of the missing affinity rating describing a degree of affinity associated with the user Sven and the lemonade item see .

Similarly when a new item needs to be added to the system the prediction module in various embodiments may estimate the item parameters i of the new item for direct insertion into the item matrix I by generating a solution e.g. ALS solution of Ui u by solving for i where u are ratings of the new item by some of the existing k users in ratings matrix R.

For example illustrates an example of the same ratings matrix R illustrated in except that a new column j corresponding to a new printer item has been inserted into the ratings matrix R by the prediction module . The row j identifying the new printer item includes various known affinity ratings e.g. r r describing a degree of affinity associated with the new printer item and associated with various existing users in columns k k. For example rating r describes a degree of affinity associated with the new printer item and the user George rating r describes a degree of affinity associated with the new printer item and the user Miguel etc. illustrates an example of item matrix I with item parameters i i i i and i describing the new printer item that may be estimated by the prediction module .

In particular the prediction module generates a solution e.g. ALS solution of Ui r by solving for i where r are ratings of the new item by some of the existing k users in ratings matrix R. That is since the user matrix U with user parameters u describing each of the users has already been generated see the prediction module may assume that the product of item parameters i describing the new item and the user parameters corresponding to a specific user will produce the known affinity rating describing the degree of affinity associated with the new item and that specific user. For example prediction module may assume that the product of i i i i and i describing the new printer item see and the user parameters u u describing the user George see will produce the known affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the printer item and the user George see . Thus based on the already generated user matrix U and user parameters u therein and based on all the known affinity ratings r associated with the new item the prediction module generates a solution e.g ALS solution of Ui r by solving for i in order to estimate the item parameters i of the new item e.g. i i i i and i illustrated in and insert them into the item matrix I see .

Moreover according to various exemplary embodiments once the item parameters of the new item are estimated these item parameters may be utilized by the prediction module to estimate missing ratings associated with the new item. For example the prediction module may generate the dot product of the estimated item parameters i i i i and i for the printer item see and the user parameters u u describing the user Robert see to produce an estimate of the missing affinity rating describing a degree of affinity associated with the printer item and the user Robert see .

According to various exemplary embodiments a similar technique to the aforementioned incremental approximate update may also be performed by the prediction module to update user parameters u and item parameters i based on new affinity ratings information associated with existing users and items that is received after ratings matrix R is already factored into user matrix U and item matrix I.

For example when an existing user represented by a row k in ratings matrix R provides a new rating of an existing product represented by a column j that new rating can be used to update the user parameters u of that user immediately rather than waiting until a new complete factorization of ratings matrix R is complete. For example referring to the ratings matrix R in suppose a new rating r describing a degree of affinity associated with existing user Miguel represented by a row k and the smartphone item represented by column j is received.

The prediction module generates a solution e.g. ALS solution of Iu r by solving for u. That is since the item matrix I with item parameters i describing each of the items has already been generated see the prediction module may assume that the product of user parameters describing an existing user and the item parameters describing an existing item should produce the known affinity rating describing the degree of affinity that is associated with the existing user and that existing item. For example prediction module may assume that the product of user parameters u u describing the user Miguel see and the item parameters i i i i i describing the smartphone item see should produce the new affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the user Miguel and the smartphone item. Thus based on the already generated item matrix I and item parameters i therein and based on all the known affinity ratings r associated with a user including the newly received affinity rating the prediction module generates a solution e.g ALS solution of Iu r by solving for u in order to revise the user parameters u in the user matrix U.

Instead or in addition when an existing user represented by a row k in ratings matrix R provides a new rating of an existing product represented by a column j that new rating can be used to update the item parameters i of that existing product immediately rather than waiting until a new complete factorization of ratings matrix R is complete. For example referring to the ratings matrix R in suppose a new rating r describing a degree of affinity associated with existing user Miguel represented by a row k and the smartphone item represented by column j is received.

The prediction module generates a solution e.g ALS solution of Ui r by solving for i. That is since the user matrix U with user parameters u describing each of the users has already been generated see the prediction module may assume that the product of item parameters describing an existing item and the user parameters describing an existing user should produce the known affinity rating describing the degree of affinity associated with that existing item and user. For example prediction module may assume that the product of item parameters i i i i i describing the existing smartphone item see and the user parameters u u describing the user Miguel see should produce the new affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the smartphone and the user Miguel. Thus based on the already generated user matrix U and user parameters u therein and based on all the known affinity ratings r associated with an item including the newly received affinity rating the prediction module generates a solution e.g ALS solution of Ui r by solving for i in order to revise the item parameters i in the item matrix I.

Moreover according to various exemplary embodiments after the prediction module updates the parameters for a user submitting a new rating the prediction module updates the item parameters for other items rated by that user. For example since the dot product of the user parameters for a particular user and the item parameters for a particular item should produce the known affinity ratings describing the degree of affinity associated with the user and the particular item the updating of the user parameters for a particular user e.g. user parameters u u for user Miguel in may require updates to the item parameters for various items e.g. the lemonade item and the scooter item in given the known affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the user Miguel and the lemonade item and given known affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the user Miguel and the scooter item see . That is the dot product of the revised user parameters u u describing Miguel and the item parameters i describing the scooter item should equal the affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the user Miguel and the scooter item see . Thus based on the revised user parameters u describing a user and all the known affinity ratings r associated with the user including the newly received affinity rating the prediction module generates a solution e.g. ALS solution of Ui r by solving for i in order to revise the item parameters i in the item matrix I.

Similarly according to various exemplary embodiments after the prediction module updates the item parameters for an item having a new rating the prediction module updates the user parameters for other users that rated that item. For example since the dot product of the item parameters for a particular item and the user parameters for a particular user should produce the known affinity ratings describing the degree of affinity associated with the particular user and the particular item the updating of the item parameters for a particular item e.g. i describing the smartphone item in may require updates to the user parameters for various users e.g. the user George in given the known affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the smartphone item and the user George. That is the dot product of the revised item parameters i describing the smartphone item and the user parameters u u describing the user George must equal the affinity rating r describing the degree of affinity associated with the user George and the smartphone item see . Thus based on the revised item parameters i describing an item and all the known affinity ratings r associated with the item including the newly received affinity rating the prediction module generates a lea solution e.g. ALS solution of Iu r by solving for u in order to revise the user parameters u in the user matrix U.

The aforementioned incremental process for computing parameters for new users and items or updating parameters for existing users and items may be used to first compute the factorization of R instead of relying on an offline batch factorization of R ahead of time. The incremental process of the aforementioned embodiments can be used with a factorization of R created by SVD based on ALS techniques.

A common problem with computing parameters for new users or items may be that it requires an existing set of ratings for the new user or users that have rated the item for new items. One technique for dealing with this is to cold start new items by training them with a set of tags that are treated as if they were users. These artificial users in turn are trained by existing items that have the same tags. A similar approach can be used to cold start new users training them with fake items each of which is represented by a tag that other existing users have tagged themselves with.

According to various exemplary embodiments the system incorporates the concept of confidence into the ratings of the ratings matrix R by generating a confidence matrix C with the same dimensions of ratings matrix R where every non missing entry i.e. every known affinity rating in ratings matrix R has a corresponding entry in confidence matrix C that specifies the confidence of the corresponding value in ratings matrix R.

The prediction module may estimate a confidence value associated with every known affinity rating in the ratings matrix R based on various factors. As some non limiting examples the prediction module may take into account 1 whether a positive affinity rating associated with a user and item was generated based on the user clicking on a page associated with the item resulting in a low confidence value or 2 whether a positive affinity rating associated with a user and item was generated based on the user providing positive feedback regarding the item to a machine learning facility such as machine learning facility in resulting in a high confidence value or 3 whether a positive affinity rating associated with a user and item was generated based on the user purchasing the item resulting in a high confidence value or 4 based whether the user has not returned the purchased item after a predetermined time period resulting in a higher confidence value and so on. The confidence value may for example be a number between 0 and 1 0 indicating no confidence and 1 indicating the highest confidence.

After the prediction module estimates a confidence value associated with every known affinity rating in the ratings matrix R the prediction module may generate the confidence matrix C that is substantially similar to the ratings matrix R except the confidence matrix C includes the confidence values corresponding to each rating associated with a particular user and item. illustrates an example of a confidence matrix C that is similar to the ratings matrix R illustrated in except the confidence matrix C includes confidence values corresponding to the various ratings. For example the confidence value c in confidence matrix C indicates the confidence associated with the affinity rating r see describing a degree of affinity associated with the user Miguel and the smartphone item.

Thus in an online shopping application the prediction module may store an affinity rating in R k j 1.0 when a user identified in column k clicks on a product listing page for an item identified in column j indicating a high affinity between the user and the item. Nevertheless the prediction module may store a very low confidence C k j 0.1 indicating that while the user may like the item since they clicked on the item s product page it is a very weak indicator of affinity. As another example if the same user buys the same item the prediction module may store an affinity rating of R k j 1.0 indicating a high affinity between the user and the item and the prediction module may store a very high confidence C k j 0.9 indicating that it is a strong indicator of affinity. Further if the user has not returned to the store after two weeks prediction module may increase the confidence value to C k j 0.99.

Given the confidence values associated with each of the affinity ratings in matrix R the prediction module may utilize a weighted least squares approach when factorizing the ratings matrix R into user matrix U and item matrix I in order to generate revised matrix R . That is instead of the prediction module computing the user matrix U and item matrix I using an alternating least squares approach where all of the affinity ratings in ratings matrix R are given the same weight each of the affinity ratings in ratings matrix R may be weighted by the prediction module based on the corresponding confidence value in confidence matrix C such that the ALS technique used by the prediction module produces a better recommendation result. Factorization of matrices using a weighted least squares approach is well understood by those skilled in the art and shall not be described in more detail herein in the interests of brevity.

According to various exemplary embodiments the recommendation system may further improve in recommendation accuracy by estimating whether missing affinity ratings in ratings matrix R result from a user not being interested in the items they didn t rate or whether the user was unfamiliar with the items they didn t rate. For example a man may not rate many women s shoes he views on a shopping web site because he s not interested in women s shoes. On the other hand he may not have rated a new restaurant simply because he has never heard of it even if after going to it he would like it.

According to one approach the prediction module may address this by randomly sampling items that have not been rated by each user and assume a low confidence dislike between the user and the item. This assumes that there is a reason that the user has not rated the item such as not being interested in the item.

According to another approach the prediction module may address this by first estimating the probability p k j that a user k has had a chance or opportunity to rate item j or follow purchase click etc. the item j and then assigning a missing affinity rating R k j in matrix R a value close to 0 meaning dislike or low affinity between the user k and item j with confidence value of C k j p k j . This indicates that an item a user has had a chance to rate but has not rated should be considered with high confidence to be an item the user is not interested in and so shouldn t be recommended to that user. This also indicates that an item a user has not had a chance to rate should be considered with little confidence to be an item the user is not interested in. In the example above the user had ample opportunity to search out and rate women s shoes but never did and so the prediction module assumes that the user is not interested in women s shoes. On the other hand the user did not have a chance to see the new restaurant and so the prediction module does not assume the new restaurant is disliked by the user.

In the system estimates the probability that a user has had a chance to rate an item where the user and the item are associated with a missing affinity rating in ratings matrix R. In the system replaces the missing affinity rating in ratings matrix R with a low affinity rating e.g. 0 . In the system inserts a confidence value associated with the user and the item in a confidence matrix C where the confidence value has a value equal to the probability estimated in . In the system generates a revised ratings matrix R by factoring the ratings matrix R into user matrix U and item matrix I based on a weighted least squares technique that takes into account the confidence values i.e. that weights each affinity rating in the ratings matrix based on the corresponding confidence value in the confidence matrix .

According to various exemplary embodiments the recommendation system is configured to deal interpret non negative feedback. For example in systems like Facebook s Like button or Google s 1 button there is no corresponding dislike button. This means that there can be no negative feedback only positive feedback on which items a user likes. Similar unbalanced rating problems arise in social networks e.g. where you can only follow people online offline shopping where the vast majority of data such as purchases clicks products being added to shopping carts etc. only shows positive feedback ratings search engine result selection advertising optimization and so forth. Accordingly it may be difficult to interpret whether missing affinity values in the ratings matrix R correspond to negative feedback. The aforementioned embodiments of modeling a probability of user u having had the opportunity to rate follow purchase click and the like on item can be used to model missing values in R as negative feedback which may provide significant increase in recommendation accuracy.

For example according to various exemplary embodiments the recommendation system estimates a probability in p j k that a missing affinity rating corresponds to a negative affinity rating. For example the prediction module may organize all the k items in ratings matrix R into a taxonomy of different categories t such as the smartphone item and tablet item being in the category electronics the lemonade item being in the category food and beverages the scooter item being in the category vehicles and transportation and so forth. Thereafter the prediction module may assume p k j p k t where item j is in category t. Note that p k j is the probability that a missing affinity rating associated with user k and item j corresponds to a negative affinity rating and p k t is the probability that a missing affinity rating associated with user k and an item in category t corresponds to a negative affinity rating 

The value of p k t itself may be computed prediction module as the fraction of user j s ratings that are associated with category t. For example referring to since half of user Robert s known ratings are in the category of electronics one rating r is for the tablet device the other rating r is for lemonade then p k t or the probability that Robert s missing affinity rating in the category of electronics corresponds to negative feedback can be calculated by prediction module to be 0.5. As another example if all of a user k s known ratings are in a single category t then p k t or the probability that a missing affinity rating in the category t corresponds to negative feedback can be calculated by prediction module to be 1.

Alternatively p k t could be estimated as what fraction of items in category t user k has rated. Alternatively if each item j corresponds to a web page or advertisement p k j may be computed based on what fraction of user k s page views were of the page advertisement or other content associated with item j. Alternatively if item j is a search result p k j can be computed as how many times user k viewed item j optionally scaled by the ranking of item j in the search results.

After the value of p k j p k t is determined the prediction module may then assign a missing affinity rating R k j in matrix R a value close to 0 meaning dislike or negative affinity between the user k and item j with confidence value of C k j p k j . This indicates that if the user has not rated a given item but the user has frequently rated similar items then the given item should be considered with high confidence to be an item the user is not interested in and so shouldn t be recommended to that user. This also indicates that if the user has not rated a given item and the user has rarely rated similar items then the given item should be considered with low confidence to be an item the user is not interested in.

Another way for prediction module to estimate p u i may be to start create a matrix W which is a k by j matrix representing which users have been known to see or rate which items in the system. For example a specific entry W k j may represent that the user k has not viewed or seen the item j if the value of W k j 0 whereas the entry may represent that the user k has viewed or seen the item j if the value of W k j 1. Reducing this matrix to a lower rank approximation may allow a better inference of which users have been exposed or acted on which items. For example computing the SVD or principle components of W allows the use of some number of those principle components to predict a new W matrix that provides estimates for which items users have seen but chose not to rate than the matrix W does.

As described above each row of the user matrix U includes user parameters associated with each user in the ratings matrix R and each column of the item matrix I includes item parameters associated with each of the items in the ratings matrix R.

According to various exemplary embodiments the recommendation system is configured to determine the user to user similarity of two or more users e.g. determine whether a first user is similar to a second user based on the user parameters in the user matrix U. For example the prediction module may determine that a first user is similar to a second user by determining the cosine similarity between two vectors corresponding to the user parameters of the first and second users and determining that the cosine similarity is greater than or less than a specific threshold. For example the prediction module may determine the similarity of the users Robert and Miguel by calculating the cosine similarity of the vectors u u u u u which corresponds to the user parameters for Robert see and u u u u u which corresponds to the user parameters for Miguel see and then determining whether the thus calculated cosine similarity is greater than or less than a predetermined threshold. The determination of the cosine similarity which is a measure of similarity between two vectors by measuring the cosine of the angle between them is well understood by those skilled in the art and shall not be described in more detail herein in the interests of brevity.

As another example the prediction module may determine that a first user is similar to a second user by determining the Euclidean distance between two vectors corresponding to the user parameters of the first and second users and determining that the calculated Euclidean distance is greater than or less than a specific threshold. The determination of Euclidean distance between vectors is well understood by those skilled in the art and shall not be described in more detail herein in the interests of brevity. As yet another example the prediction module may determine that a first user is similar to a second user by calculating the dot product of two vectors corresponding to the user parameters associated with the first and second users and determining that the dot product is greater than or less than a specific threshold.

Similarly the prediction module may determine the item to item similarity of two or more items e.g. determine whether a first item is similar to a second item based on the item parameters in the user matrix I using Cosine similarity Euclidean distance dot product etc. as described above with regards to determining user to user similarity. The aforementioned examples of cosine similarity Euclidian distance and dot product are merely exemplary and it should be understood that any other metrics and methods of measuring similarity between two vectors may be utilized by the prediction module to determine similarity between users and items.

After the prediction module determines that a first user is similar to a second user the prediction module assigns recommendations or affinity ratings associated with the first user to the second user and vice versa. For example with reference to if the users George and Miguel are similar then George s affinity rating r for the tablet may also be imputed to Miguel. If the system or a machine learning facility such as machine learning facility illustrated in decides to recommend an item to George the system may recommend the item or a similar item to Miguel. Likewise if the system or a machine learning facility decides not to recommend an item to George the system may not recommend the item or a similar item to Miguel. Moreover when the system or machine learning facility provides the recommendation to Miguel the system or facility may inform the user Miguel that they are considered similar to the user George and this item was also recommended to George or George liked this item etc. . Thus user to user similarity may be important for showing who else is like a particular user and providing justification for why a recommendation is right. For example the system or facility might not only show a particular user that a camera is a good recommendation but may also show other people that like the camera who are similar to the particular user.

Similarly after the prediction module determines that a first item is similar to a second item the system assigns recommendations or affinity ratings associated with the first item to the second item and vice versa. For example if the smartphone and tablet items are similar then Miguel s affinity rating r for the smartphone see may also be imputed to the tablet. If the system or a machine learning facility such as machine learning facility illustrated in decides to recommend an item e.g. smartphone to a particular user e.g. Miguel the system may recommend a similar item e.g. tablet to that same user e.g. Miguel .

According to various exemplary embodiments the prediction module may determine user to user similarity by counting the number of affinity ratings a pair of users have in common i.e. by counting the number of times a first user and a second user have a given affinity for the same item and if the number of common ratings is greater than a predetermined threshold the users may be considered to be similar by the prediction module .

Moreover the prediction module may take into account item to item similarity when counting the number of common ratings between two users i.e. by counting the number of times a first user and a second user have a given affinity for similar items . For example if Miguel has submitted a like rating of the smartphone and Robert as submitted a like rating of the tablet and the smartphone and the tablet are considered to be similar items or have a high item to item similarity then the prediction module may count this as a common rating of Miguel and Robert i.e. both of them have something in common that they like . If the number of common ratings is greater than a predetermined threshold the users may be considered to be similar by the prediction module . After the prediction module determines that a first user is similar to a second user the prediction module may assign recommendations or affinity ratings associated with the first user to the second user and vice versa as described in various embodiments above.

Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied 1 on a non transitory machine readable medium or 2 in a transmission signal or hardware implemented modules. A hardware implemented module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware implemented module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware implemented module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily or transitorily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware implemented modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware implemented modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware implemented module at a different instance of time.

Hardware implemented modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware implemented modules. Accordingly the described hardware implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware implemented modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware implemented modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware implemented modules have access. For example one hardware implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware implemented module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice.
