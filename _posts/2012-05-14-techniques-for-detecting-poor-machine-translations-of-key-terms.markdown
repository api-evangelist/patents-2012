This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 305 852 filed on Nov. 29 2011. The entire disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure generally relates to techniques for detecting poor machine translations of key terms.

On line advertising has become an effective means to target potential consumers. One form of on line advertising is advertising in search engines using key terms. A key term may be a phrase including one or more words or strings of characters that a search engine user may include in a query for a particular topic. An advertiser can direct Internet traffic to one or more web pages called landing pages using a search engine advertising campaign which utilizes key terms. The advertiser will provide a list of key terms that the advertiser believes a potential customer would enter when looking for a web page that contains subject matter similar to the landing page. For instance a purveyor of hiking boots could provide a list of key terms to a search engine that includes hiking boots hiking shoes trail shoes and outdoor gear such that when a search engine user executes a search using any of the key terms as the search term an advertisement containing a hyperlink to the landing page of the advertiser is presented to the user.

This section provides a general summary of the disclosure and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.

Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. The description and specific examples in this summary are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.

Corresponding reference numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings.

As can be appreciated the foregoing framework for advertising a web page may be an efficient means of attracting users e.g. potential consumers to the webpage as the advertising creatives and are presented to a user based on the search query entered by the potential consumer. An advertiser can utilize an advertising campaign that is designed to attract potential consumers to the advertiser s web page. An advertising campaign may include a set of key terms that the advertiser registers with the search engine one or more advertising creatives and one or more hyperlinks to one or more landing pages to which the advertising campaign is directed. The key terms can be conceptually related to the content of the advertiser s landing page. Each key term can be comprised of one or more words or strings of characters. When a search engine user enters a search query containing the key term the search engine can retrieve one or more advertising creatives and corresponding to the entered key term which may be provided for display at a user terminal of the user. Thus a key term may be thought of as a hypothetical search query that a user may provide to a search engine when searching for a particular subject matter or web page.

As discussed an advertiser may register one or more key terms at a search engine as part of the advertiser s advertising campaign. Typically the advertiser can register a key term or advertising campaign for search engine queries originating from a specific geographic area. A geographic area can be a country a state a municipality or any other geographically distinct region. For example in the illustrated example provided above an advertiser may register the key term baby strollers for searches originating from the United States. On line advertisers may desire to expand their market reaching into other geographic areas.

The foregoing environment for the regional expansion module is an example and variations thereof are contemplated. For instance in some environments the regional expansion module can execute on the user terminal as an offline or an online tool. Furthermore the regional expansion module can be implemented as an application programming interface API to suggest geographic areas to an advertiser based on certain key terms that are provided as part of an advertising campaign.

The user interface module provides for display at the user terminal an interface for a user e.g. a potential advertiser to interact with the regional expansion module . The user interface module can present a screen or multiple screens that allow the user to provide one or more key terms a preexisting advertising campaign and a potential market selection to the regional expansion module for analysis. The potential market selection indicates N geographic areas where N is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For example if the potential market selection is Europe the geographic areas can include Spain United Kingdom France Germany Russia etc.

The key term input area allows a user to provide one or more potential key terms that are to be analyzed by the regional expansion module . For example the user can enter the potential key term baby stroller into a text box located in the key term input area .

The advertising campaign input area allows a user to provide a preexisting advertising campaign that is to be analyzed by the regional expansion module . It is appreciated that a preexisting advertising campaign may be stored at the user terminal or at a remote storage device having a network address e.g. a file server. The user can enter the location of the preexisting advertising campaign in the advertising campaign input area . For example the user can provide a file path indicating the location of the advertising campaign in the file system of the user terminal or can provide network address indicating the location of the advertising campaign at the remote storage device.

The potential market selection area allows a user to provide the potential market selection. As mentioned the potential market selection can indicate one or more geographic areas that are to be analyzed for potential advertising opportunities. In the example the potential market selection area provides a first drop down menu where the user can provide a potential market selection. A potential market selection may be a continent e.g. Europe Asia a region e.g. Middle East or any other collection of geographic areas e.g. G20 countries and emerging markets. The potential market selection may also be all of the countries of the world or a single country. It is appreciated that the foregoing is an example of a potential market selection area and other mechanisms for providing a potential market selection are within the scope of the disclosure.

The current market selection area allows a user to provide current market information such as a geographic area where the user is currently advertising and a source language of the one or more key terms provided in the key term input area . In the illustrated example the current market selection area provides a second drop down menu that allows a user to select a current geographic area and a third drop down menu that allows a user to select a source language of the one or more key terms provided.

As can be appreciated the user can provide information such as a key term an advertising campaign a potential market selection and or current market information using the screen presented by the user interface module . Upon entering the key term the potential market selection and or the current market information the user can click on a find opportunity icon to transmit the provided information to the regional expansion module . It should be appreciated that the information can be provided in any other suitable manner. The user terminal can transmit the information over the communication network to the user interface module of the regional expansion module . The user interface module can provide the received information to the key term determination module . It should be appreciated that the foregoing screen is provided for example only and is not intended to be limiting.

Referring again to the key term determination module can receive the one or more potential key terms and or the preexisting advertising campaign as well as the potential market selection indicating one or more geographic areas. Further the key term determination module can receive the current market information such as a source language of the key term and a current market in which the key term is utilized.

The key term determination module determines a plurality of key terms that are to be analyzed by the regional expansion module . The key term determination module can extract the plurality of key terms from the one or more potential key terms and or the preexisting advertising campaign. The key term determination module can include some or all of the potential key terms provided by the user in the plurality of key terms that are to be analyzed by the regional expansion module . Similarly the received advertising campaign may include one or more campaign key terms e.g. the key terms extracted from the advertising campaign. The key term determination module may also include the campaign key terms in the plurality of key terms.

The key term determination module can be further configured to extract additional key terms from the advertising creative of the advertising campaign and or the website that is linked to by the advertising campaign. It should be appreciated that an advertising creative may include a text portion and a hyperlink to a website. The key term determination module can parse the advertising creative to identify words or strings of words that could be used as key term which are referred to as possible key terms.

The key term determination module can also parse the advertising creative to identify a hyperlink that links to the webpage to which the advertising campaign is directed. The key term determination module can receive website data representing the website e.g. HTML code. The key term determination module can parse the website data to identify text that is displayed in the website. From the identified text the key term determination module can identify words or strings of words that could be used as key terms which are referred to as possible key terms.

The key term determination module for each possible key term identified in the text portion of the advertising creative and the website corresponding to the hyperlink can determine whether to include the possible key term in the plurality of key terms to be analyzed. It is appreciated that the key term determination module may make this determination in any suitable manner. For instance the key term determination module may query a query log database to determine whether a possible key term is to be included in the plurality of key terms. It is noted that the query log database may be a component of the regional expansion module or may be located at a different location or server. The key term determination module may access the query log database via a network such as an intranet or the Internet. The query log database is a database that stores a representative sampling of search queries provided to one or more search engines as well as web pages that have been accessed as a result of the search query. It is noted that the query log database may only include commercial searches and may exclude private or non commercial search queries and results thereby protecting the privacy of a search engine user. Further the query log database can also store search queries anonymously to further protect the privacy of a search engine user.

The key term determination module can provide each possible key term to the query log database to determine which of the possible key terms can be considered legitimate search queries. If the possible key term has been used as a search query in more than a nominal amount of searches then the possible key term may be included in the plurality of key terms to be analyzed. If the possible key term has not been used as a search query or has only been used a nominal amount of times as a search query then the possible key term can be disregarded. It is appreciated that the foregoing technique for determining whether potential key terms should be included in the plurality of key terms to be analyzed is provided for example only. Other techniques can be implemented and are within the scope of this disclosure.

For each one of the one or more geographic areas indicated in the potential market selection the key term determination module can be further configured to determine one or more pertinent languages of the geographic area. In some embodiments the key term determination module can obtain the one or more pertinent languages of a geographic area from a languages database . The languages database can store pertinent languages of a plurality of different geographic areas.

The pertinent languages of a geographic area can be based upon any suitable metric. In some embodiments the pertinent languages of a geographic area can be based upon the amount of total search engine queries that originate from the geographic area in a particular language. For example if 100 000 search engine queries originate from the particular geographic area and 50 000 search queries are in English 25 000 are in French 20 000 are in Dutch 4 000 are in Flemish and the rest of the search engine queries are in various other languages the pertinent languages of the geographic area may be English French Dutch and Flemish but not any of the various other languages. In this example a language is considered a pertinent language of a particular geographic area if the amount of searches originating from the particular geographic area in the language in relation to the total amount of searches originating from the particular geographic area in any language is greater than a predetermined threshold e.g. 5 . If the total amount of searches is greater than the predetermined threshold then the language is considered a pertinent language of a geographic area. Other means for determining the pertinent languages of a geographic area are further considered and are within the scope of the disclosure.

Upon determining the pertinent languages of a geographic area the key term determination module can translate each key term from the source language to each of the pertinent languages of a geographic area thereby obtaining a plurality of translated key terms in each of the pertinent languages of the geographic area. In some embodiments the key term determination module provides the plurality of key terms to a translation engine that translates the key terms from a source language to a target language. Thus the key term determination module can further provide the source language of the plurality of key terms and the pertinent language to which the plurality of key terms are being translated. The translation engine may perform a machine translation of the plurality of key terms and return a plurality of translated key terms in the pertinent language.

The translation engine can return a plurality of translated key terms in a pertinent language to the key term determination module . In some embodiments the plurality of translated key terms can be analyzed to determine whether each of the plurality of translated key terms are appropriate translations. In some scenarios the translation engine may return a translation that is too broad. For example the key term laptop bag translated from English to Russian may result in a translated key term cya meaning bag. In these scenarios the key term determination module may be configured to discard overly broad translated key terms. It is appreciated that the translated key terms may be analyzed for other deficiencies in the machine translation provided by the translation engine such as an inaccurate geographic translation or an overly narrow translation.

It should be appreciated that the key term determination module can obtain translations of key terms in any other suitable manner. For instance the key term determination module may be configured to perform machine translation of key terms using techniques now known or later developed. It should further be appreciated that the key term determination module obtains a plurality of translated key terms for each pertinent language for each of the one or more geographic areas. Either prior to translating a key term or after a translated key term is received techniques such as removing the stop words e.g. a an and the from either the key term or the translated key term may be performed by the key term determination module . The key term determination module can provide the plurality of translated key terms to the scoring module . The key term determination module may further provide the geographic area to which a plurality of translated key terms corresponds.

The scoring module receives a plurality of translated key terms and the geographic area to which the translated key terms correspond. For instance if the key terms baby stroller and infant stroller translate to kinderwagen and kleinkindz kinderwagen respectively in German and the geographic area being analyzed is Germany the scoring module can receive the plurality of translated key terms e.g. kinderwagen and kleinkind kinderwagen and a geographic area indicator e.g. Germany. For each one of the plurality of translated key terms the scoring module determines advertising statistics for the translated key terms in the geographic area. In some embodiments the scoring module may retrieve advertising statistics for a particular translated key term from the statistics database . The statistics database stores the advertising statistics for a plurality of key terms in a plurality of different languages for a plurality of different geographic areas. The advertising statistics of a translated key term may be indicative of a traffic value of the translated key term in the geographic area a cost value of the translated key term in the geographic area a click through rate of the translated key term and a competition value for the translated key term in the geographic area.

The traffic value of a translated key term can correspond to a number of search queries containing the translated key term that originated from the one geographic area and were provided to a search engine during a predetermined period of time. For example the traffic value may be indicative of an average amount of monthly search queries containing the translated key term that were provided to a search engine from the geographic area.

The cost value of a translated key term can correspond to a price associated with utilizing the translated key term in a search engine advertising campaign for the geographic area. For example the cost value may indicate a cost per click for the translated key term in the geographic area e.g. an amount of money the advertiser must pay each time the advertising creative is displayed and the hyperlink contained therein is clicked by a user.

The click through rate of a translated key term corresponds to a number of instances where an advertisement is presented to one or more search engine users in response to a search query originating from the one geographic area and containing the translated key term in relation to a number of instances where the one or more search engine users click on a hyperlink associated with the advertisement. In some embodiments the click through rate of a translated key term is defined by 

The competition value of a translated key term can correspond to a number of entities that have registered the translated key term in other advertising campaigns directed to the geographic area. The competition value can be normalized such that the amount of competition can be represented on a scale of for example only 0 1 or 0 100. For example if a maximum amount of competition for a particular key term is 100 advertisers and currently 90 advertisers have registered the particular key term in other advertising campaigns the competition value may be 90 100 or 0.9.

For each pertinent language of a geographic area the scoring module can determine a term specific score for each translated key term of corresponding to the pertinent language. The scoring module can determine the term specific score of a translated key term based on the advertising statistics of the translated key term. A term specific score of a translated key term may be indicative of a degree of desirability of using the translated key term in a search engine advertising campaign in the geographic area. In some embodiments the term specific score is based on the advertising statistics of the translated key term in the geographic area. For example the term specific score of a translated key term may be determined using the following formula 

It is appreciated that the term specific score can be determined using other formulas or metric. For example in some embodiments the term specific score of a translated key term may be determined using the following formula 

As previously indicated in some pertinent languages a key term may translate to multiple translated key terms. In these scenarios the scoring module can score the multiple translated key terms in the pertinent language individually.

The scoring module can determine term specific scores of the plurality of translated key terms for each pertinent language of each of the geographic areas. Furthermore for each of the geographic areas the scoring module can generate a language specific score for each pertinent language of the geographic area and an area specific score for each of the geographic areas. For example if the geographic area is Germany and the pertinent languages are English German Russian and Spanish the scoring module may generate language specific scores for each pertinent language e.g. the language specific score of German with respect to Germany can be obtained by averaging the term specific scores of all the translated key terms in German. Further the scoring module can generate an area specific score for Germany by for example averaging the language specific scores of each pertinent language of Germany or by averaging the term specific scores of all the translated key terms corresponding to Germany.

The suggestion module can determine a market suggestion indicating one or more of the geographic areas in the market selection. For each of the one or more geographic areas the suggestion module can determine whether to include the geographic area in the market suggestion based on the term specific scores corresponding to the geographic area the language specific scores corresponding to the geographic area and or the area specific score of the geographic area. In some embodiments the suggestion module sorts or ranks the geographic areas in accordance with the area specific scores of the geographic areas. The suggestion module can suggest geographic areas to the user based on the rankings of the geographic areas. For example the suggestion module may suggest the top five or ten geographic areas. In some embodiments the suggestion module can suggest any geographic area having a score above a threshold.

It is appreciated that the suggestion module can further rank the pertinent languages of a geographic area in accordance with the language specific scores of the pertinent languages. For each geographic area the suggestion module may select one or more pertinent languages to suggest for advertising based on the rankings of the pertinent languages with respect to their geographic area. For example if the pertinent languages of a geographic area are English Spanish and Arabic and the language specific scores of English and Spanish are relatively high but the language specific score of Arabic is relatively low the suggestion module may suggest to the user to advertise in English and Spanish but not in Arabic. It is appreciated that the suggestion module may select the highest ranked pertinent languages e.g. the top four pertinent languages or may select any pertinent language with a language specific score above a predetermined threshold.

Similarly for each pertinent language of a geographic area the plurality of translated key terms corresponding thereto may be ranked in accordance with their respective term specific scores. For each pertinent language the suggestion module may select one or more translated key terms corresponding to the pertinent languages to suggest for inclusion in an advertising campaign based on the rankings of the translated key terms with respect to their pertinent language. For example if the translated key terms in English include a first translated key term a second translated key term and a third translated key term and the term specific scores of the first translated key term and the second translated key term are relatively high but the term specific score of the third translated key term is relatively low the suggestion module may suggest to the user to use the first and second translated key terms in an advertising campaign but not the third translated key term. It is appreciated that the suggestion module may select the highest ranked translated key terms e.g. the top five translated key terms or may select any translated key term with a term specific score above a predetermined threshold.

The suggestion module can provide the market selection of the user interface module for display at a user terminal . For each geographic area the suggestion module may further provide the pertinent languages and or the translated key terms that have been selected for inclusion in the market suggestion. The user interface module can receive the geographic areas pertinent languages and translated key terms that have been selected for suggestion and generates a screen that is presented for display at the user terminal . The screen that is presented for display may indicate the geographic areas included in the market suggestion the pertinent languages of the geographic areas of the market suggestion and the translated key terms in each of the pertinent languages. Further advertising statistics corresponding to the geographic areas selected for suggestion the pertinent languages of the geographic areas selected for suggestion and the translated key terms can also be provided for display at the user terminal.

The suggestion field can selectively display geographic areas that are included in the market suggestion the pertinent languages of the suggested geographic areas and the translated key terms for each pertinent language. In some embodiments the geographic areas are displayed in accordance with their respective score rankings e.g. the most desirable geographic area is displayed first. In the example provided a first suggested geographic area is provided for display. In this example the first suggested geographic area is Germany. The user can elect to have the pertinent languages of the first suggested geographic area displayed on the screen . In the illustrated example the pertinent languages of Germany can be displayed below the first suggested geographic area . For instance a first pertinent language English a second pertinent language German a third pertinent language Russian and a fourth pertinent language Spanish can be displayed. For each pertinent language the user may be allowed to view the translated key term in the corresponding pertinent language. In the example provided the user has elected to have the translated key term in German e.g. kinderwagen and the translated key term in Russian displayed. It is appreciated that if a key term translates to more than one translated key term in a pertinent language multiple translated key terms may be displayed to the user under the corresponding pertinent language.

The desirability field can indicate the degree of desirability of advertising in a corresponding suggested geographic area e.g. the area specific score of a geographic area the degree of desirability of advertising in a corresponding pertinent language of the suggested geographic area e.g. the language specific score of the pertinent language or a degree of desirability of using a corresponding translated key term in an advertising campaign in the suggested geographic area e.g. the term specific score of the translated key term . It is appreciated that the degree of desirability is based on the score corresponding to one of a geographic area a pertinent language or a translated key term. In some embodiments the scores of a geographic area a pertinent language and or a translated key term can be normalized on a scale of for example 0 1 or 0 100. In these embodiments the degree of desirability can be displayed as a percentage or on a meter icon as shown in . For example a degree of desirability icon associated with the first suggest geographic area indicates that Germany has a high degree of desirability associated thereto. It is appreciated that the degree of desirability associated with geographic area a pertinent language or a translated key term may be displayed in any other suitable manner. For instance the numerical score indicating the degree of desirability of a geographic area a pertinent language or a translated key term may be displayed to a user.

In the example provided when a traffic value e.g. traffic value is correlated to the first suggested geographic area the traffic value may indicate the total number of searches performed for the translated key terms in each pertinent language of the geographic area. When a traffic value e.g. traffic value or is correlated to a pertinent language the traffic value may indicate the total number of search queries originating from the geographic area containing any of the translated key terms in the corresponding pertinent language. For example if a key term has two translated key terms corresponding to a particular pertinent language the traffic value may correspond to the amount of search queries originating from the geographic area having either of the two translated terms contained therein. When a traffic value e.g. traffic value is correlated to a translated key term the traffic value may indicate the total number of search queries originating from the geographic area and containing the translated key term.

The cost field can indicate a price associated with using one or more translated key terms in a search engine advertising campaign for search queries originating from a corresponding geographic area. The price may be for example only a price per click value. In the example provided when a cost value e.g. cost value is correlated to the first suggested geographic area the cost value may indicate a price per click value associated with the collection of translated key terms in each pertinent language of the geographic area. It is noted that the price per click value is only for searches originating from the geographic area. When a cost value e.g. cost value or cost value is correlated to a pertinent language e.g. pertinent language English or pertinent language German the cost value may indicate an average price per click value associated with all the translated key terms in the corresponding pertinent language. For example if a key term has two translated key terms corresponding to a particular pertinent language the cost value may correspond to an average cost per click for the two translated terms contained therein. When a cost value e.g. cost value is correlated to a translated key term the cost value may indicate a price per click value associated with the translated key term in the geographic area.

The competition field can indicate an amount of competitors that are using one or more of the translated key terms in the geographic area. In some embodiments the competition values can be normalized such that competition values can be between 0 1 or 0 100.

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example only and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Further if the ordering of the steps disclosed in the technique is not essential variations of the disclosed technique are contemplated and within the scope of the disclosure.

At the regional expansion module can extract a plurality of key terms to be analyzed from the potential key terms and or the preexisting advertising campaign. With respect to the preexisting advertising campaign the regional expansion module can extract possible key terms from the advertising creative of the advertising campaign as well as from a website which is linked to by a hyperlink contained in the advertising creative. The key terms can be extracted from the advertising campaign in any suitable manner.

Based on the potential market selection and the plurality of key terms the regional expansion module determines whether to include each one of the one or more geographic areas in the market suggestion. At the regional expansion module can determine one or more pertinent languages of one of the geographic areas of the potential market selection. As previously discussed the pertinent languages of different geographic areas can be stored in a languages database .

For each one of the one or more pertinent languages of the geographic area being analyzed the regional expansion module can obtain a translation of each key term of the plurality of key terms from the source language to the pertinent language to obtain a plurality of translated key terms in the pertinent language as shown at . For each translated key term the regional expansion module can determine advertising statistics corresponding to the translated key term with respect to the geographic area being analyzed as shown at . As discussed above the advertising statistics of a translated key term with respect to the geographic area can include but are not limited to i a traffic value of the translated key term ii a cost value of the translated key term iii a click through rate of the translated key term and iv a competition value indicative of a number of entities that have registered the translated key term in other advertising campaigns in the geographic area.

At the regional expansion module can determine a term specific score for each translated key term of the plurality of the translated key terms based on the advertising statistics of the geographic area being analyzed. As previously mentioned the term specific score of a translated key term can indicate a degree of desirability of using the translated key term in the search engine advertising campaign in the geographic area.

It is appreciated that a term specific score may be calculated for each of the pluralities of translated key terms in each of the pertinent languages of the geographic area being analyzed. Furthermore for each of the one or more pertinent languages of the geographic area language specific scores can be calculated. For example a language specific score of a pertinent language can be determined by averaging the term specific scores of the plurality of translated key terms in the pertinent language. Similarly an area specific score for the geographic area can be determined by averaging the language specific scores of one or more pertinent languages of the geographic area being analyzed or by averaging the term specific scores of all of the translated key terms that correspond to the geographic area being analyzed.

At the regional expansion module determines whether there are more geographic areas to analyze. If so the regional expansion module determines the next geographic area of the one or more geographic areas to analyze as shown at . If there are no more geographic areas to analyze the regional expansion module can determine for each one of the one or more geographic areas whether to the geographic areas in the market suggestion based on the scores of the translated key terms corresponding to the geographic area as shown at .

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example only and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Further if the ordering of the steps disclosed in the technique is not essential variations of the disclosed technique are contemplated and within the scope of the disclosure.

As discussed above the key term determination module may be configured to determine whether a translation of a key term from a source language to a target language is a poor translation. illustrates an example of a key term determination module configured to determine whether to adopt a potential translated key term as a translated key term. The key term determination module may include a language determination module a translated key term determination module a geographic location diagnostic module a narrow to broad diagnostic module a local term diagnostic module and a reverse translation diagnostic module .

The language determination module can determine one or more target languages to which a key term is to be translated. As can be appreciated a target language may be a pertinent language of a selected geographic area which may be determined from the languages database . The language determination module provides the one or more target languages to the translated key term determination module .

The translated key term determination module can receive a key term to be translated from the user interface module and one or more target languages from the language determination module . The translated key term determination module can further obtain one or more potential translated keys terms based on the key term. In some embodiments the translated key term determination module may obtain a translation of the key term from the source language to the target language by providing the key term to a translation engine which returns the one or more potential translated key terms in the target language.

The translated key term determination module can adopt one or more of the potential translated key terms as the one or more translated key terms by performing diagnostics on the potential translated key terms. The diagnostics can include a geographic location diagnostic that can be performed by the geographic location diagnostic module a narrow to broad diagnostic that can be performed by the narrow to broad diagnostic module a local term diagnostic that can be performed by the local term diagnostic module and a reverse translation diagnostic that can be performed by the reverse translation diagnostic module . Each of the diagnostics is described more fully below.

The geographic location diagnostic module can analyze a key term and a potential translated key term to determine whether they both describe geographic locations and if so whether the key term and the translated key term have a geospatial correspondence. As can be appreciated machine translations are sometimes inaccurate or inappropriate. One such inaccuracy that may occur is that one geographic location may be translated to a different geographic location. For example only a key term of London Trains may be translated to Amsterdem Treinin in Dutch which literally means Amsterdam Trains in English. The foregoing translation is inaccurate and should not be adopted as a translated key term. The geographic location diagnostic module can be implemented to discard such translations.

To perform the geographic location diagnostic the geographic location diagnostic module receives a key term and one or more potential translated key terms. The geographic location diagnostic module can parse a received key term to determine whether the key term includes one or more words describing a first geographic location. The geographic location diagnostic module can provide one or more words of the key term to a geographic locations engine . The geographic locations engine may be any service that receives one or more words or strings of numbers and determines a geographic location corresponding thereto. It is appreciated that the geographic locations engine may define an application programming interface API that allows the geographic location diagnostic module to provide the one or more words to the geographic locations engine . The geographic locations engine can be configured to return an error code or any other type of indicator when the words do not describe a geographic location or to return a first geographic location corresponding to the one or more words when the one or more words describe a geographic location.

The geographic location diagnostic module can also parse a potential translated key term into one or more translated words. The geographic location diagnostic module can provide the one or more translated words to the geographic locations engine to determine whether one or more of the translated words describe a geographic location. If the one or more words describe a geographic location. If the one or more translated words describe a geographic location the geographic locations engine can return a second geographic location corresponding thereto. The geographic location diagnostic module can compare the first geographic location with the second geographic location to determine whether the two geographic locations correspond to one another. It is appreciated that bounding boxes of a predetermined area can be defined around the first and second geographic locations to determine whether the two geographic areas overlap and therefore correspond. If the two geographic locations overlap the two geographic locations are said to geospatially correspond. If there is no overlap between the two geographic locations e.g. London and Amsterdam then the two geographic locations do not correspond and the potential translated key term can be discarded.

At the geographic location diagnostic module parses one of the one or more potential translated key terms into one or more translated words. The geographic location diagnostic module can provide the one or more translated words to the geographic locations engine as shown at . As previously discussed the geographic locations engine can return a geographic location corresponding to the potential translated key term or an error code or indicator. At the geographic location diagnostic module determines whether the potential translated key term describes a second geographic location. If the potential translated key term does not describe a second geographic location then the potential translated key term may be discarded as shown at step . If the potential translated key term does describe a second geographic location then the geographic location diagnostic module can determine whether the first geographic location geospatially corresponds to the second geographic location as shown at . As described above two geographic locations can be determined to geospatially correspond for example if the two geographic locations overlap one another. If the first and second geographic locations geospatially correspond then the potential translated key term is not discarded as shown at . If the first and second geographic locations do not geospatially correspond then the potential translated key term is discarded as shown at .

At the geographic location diagnostic module can determine whether there are any remaining potential translated key terms to analyze. If there are remaining potential translated key terms the geographic location diagnostic module obtains the next potential translated key term as shown at and returns to . If there are no remaining potential translated key terms left to be analyzed the geographic location diagnostic module may stop executing and may return a list of potential translated key terms that were not discarded.

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example only. Variations of the technique described above are contemplated and are within the scope of the disclosure.

Referring back to the narrow to broad diagnostic module determines whether the key term is more narrowly defined than any of the one or more potential translated key terms. For example the term laptop bag may be machine translated to cymka in Russian which literally translates to bag in English. This example translation may be considered a narrow to broad translation in that a narrow term laptop bag was translated to a broad term bag . The narrow to broad diagnostic module may utilize advertising statistics such as corresponding traffic values for a key term and a potential translated key term to determine whether the key term is more narrowly defined than the translated key term.

To perform the narrow to broad diagnostic the narrow to broad diagnostic module can obtain i a traffic value for the key term ii a traffic value for the potential translated key term iii a traffic value for all search queries in the source language and iv a traffic value for all search queries in the target language. It is noted that the traffic values can be constrained to include search queries originating from one or more specific geographic areas or can be unconstrained such that the traffic values include search queries originating from anywhere in the world. The narrow to broad diagnostic module can determine a first ratio of the traffic value of the key term to the traffic value of all search queries in the source language of the key term. The narrow to broad diagnostic module can also determine a second ratio of the traffic value of the potential translated key term to the traffic value of all search queries in the target language of the potential translated key term. The narrow to broad diagnostic module can compare the first ratio with the second ratio. If the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude e.g. 4 times greater than the translation of the key term to the potential translated key term is considered to be a narrow to broad translation and the potential translated key term can be discarded. If the second ratio is not greater than the first ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude the potential translated key term is not considered to be a narrow to broad translation and the potential translated key term may be further analyzed by the other diagnostic modules of the key term determination module .

At the narrow to broad diagnostic module can obtain a second traffic value indicating a total number of searches provided to the search engine in the source language. The narrow to broad diagnostic module can then determine a first ratio of the first traffic value to the second traffic value as shown at step .

For each of the potential translated key terms the narrow to broad diagnostic module can determine a second ratio for the potential translated key term. At the narrow to broad diagnostic module can obtain a third traffic value indicating the number of searches provided to the search engine which contain the potential translated key term that is currently being analyzed. At the narrow to broad diagnostic module can obtain a fourth traffic value indicating the total number of searches provided to the search engine in the target language. At the narrow to broad diagnostic module can determine a second ratio of the third traffic value to the fourth traffic value. It is appreciated that the second ratio is specific to the potential translated key term that is currently being analyzed.

At the narrow to broad diagnostic module can then compare the second ratio to the first ratio to determine if the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude. If the second ratio is not greater than the first ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude then the potential translated key term is not discarded as shown at . If the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude then the potential translated key term can be discarded as being an overly broad translation as shown at . At the narrow to broad diagnostic module can then determine whether there are any additional potential translated key terms to analyze. If there are more potential translated key terms to analyze then the narrow to broad diagnostic module obtains the next potential translated key term as shown at and returns to . If there are no remaining potential translated key terms the narrow to broad diagnostic module can stop executing.

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example only. Variations of the technique described above are contemplated and are within the scope of the disclosure.

Referring back to a local term diagnostic module can be configured to perform a local term diagnostic on the key term. A key term is considered to be a local term if the key term has a special significance in a geographic area. For example the term stock car racing may have more significance in the United States than throughout the rest of the world as stock car racing is a popular American pastime but not popular throughout the rest of the world. The local term diagnostic module utilizes advertising statistics for the key term in the source geographic area which can be received via the user interface module and advertising statistics of the key term in other geographic areas where the source language of the key term is considered a primary language. A language may be classified as a primary language of a geographic area based on various criteria. For example if a language is the official language of a geographic area then the language may be the primary language. Alternatively the primary language of a geographic area can be determined based on the amount of search queries originating from the geographic area in a language in relation to search queries originating from the geographic areas in other languages. In the example of stock car racing India England and Canada may be considered geographic areas where English is a primary language.

The local term diagnostic module can be configured to determine a first degree of significance of the key term with respect to a source geographic area and a second degree of significance of the key term with respect to one or more other geographic areas where the source language of the key term may be considered a primary language. The first degree of significance can be determined by calculating a first ratio of the traffic value of the key term in the source geographic area to a traffic value for all search queries in the source language that originate from the source geographic area. The second degree of significance can be determined by calculating a second ratio of the traffic value of the key term in one or more other geographic areas where the source language is the primary language to a traffic value for all search queries in the source language that originate from the one or more other geographic areas. The local term diagnostic module can compare the first degree of significance with the second degree of significance to determine whether the key term has a local significance in the source geographic area. For example if the first degree of significance is greater than the second degree of significance by more than a predetermined magnitude e.g. 5 times greater then the key term is determined to be a locally significant term.

The local term diagnostic module can also determine other geographic areas where the language of the key term is a primary language. The local term diagnostic module can determine the other geographic areas where the language of the key term is a primary language from the languages database as shown at . The local term diagnostic module can then obtain a third traffic value for the key term in one or more of the other geographic areas as shown at and a fourth traffic value for all search queries originating from the other geographic areas as shown at . Based on the third traffic value and the fourth traffic value the local term diagnostic module can determine a second degree of significance for the key term in the other geographic areas. For example the local term diagnostic module can determine a second ratio of the third traffic value to the fourth traffic value as shown at . It is noted that the first ratio and the second ratio should be determined in the same manner so the comparisons thereof provide insightful data.

Once the first ratio and the second ratio have been determined the local term diagnostic module compares the first ratio to the second ratio as shown at . In comparing the first ratio with the second ratio the local term diagnostic module determines whether the first ratio is greater than the second ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude e.g. 5. If the first ratio is not greater than the second ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude then the key term is determined to not have a local significance and is not considered a local term as shown at . If the first ratio is greater than the second ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude then the key term is determined to have a local significance and can be considered a local term as shown at . If a key term is determined to have a local significance the potential translated key terms corresponding thereto may be discarded or may be identified as being translations of a key term having local significance.

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example only. Variations of the technique described above are contemplated and are within the scope of the disclosure.

Referring back to the reverse translation diagnostic module can perform a reverse translation diagnostic. The reverse translation diagnostic module can obtain for each potential translated key term a reverse translation of the potential translated key term from the target language to the source language. In some embodiments the reverse translation diagnostic module can provide the potential translated key term to the translation engine which can return a machine translation of the potential translated key term from the target language to the source language. Each of the reverse translations is compared with the key term to determine if each respective reverse translation matches the key term. If a reverse translation matches the key term the potential translated key term corresponding to the reverse translation is not discarded. If a reverse translation does not match the key term the potential translated key term corresponding to the reverse translation is discarded. In some embodiments the reverse translation diagnostic module can be configured to override the discarding of the potential translated key term when all of the potential translated key terms are discarded because none of the reverse translations matched the key term. In these situations all of the potential translated key terms are kept.

If the reverse translation matches the key term at the reverse translation diagnostic module does not discard the corresponding potential translated key term as shown at . If the reverse translation does not match the key term then the reverse translation diagnostic module discards the corresponding potential translated key term as shown at . At the reverse translation diagnostic module can determine whether there are any further potential translated key terms left to analyze. If there are more potential translated key terms left to analyze the reverse translation diagnostic module obtains the next potential translated key term as shown at . If there are no remaining potential translated key terms left to analyze the reverse translation diagnostic module may stop executing. As noted above in some embodiments if the reverse translation diagnostic module determines that all of the potential translated key terms are to be discarded i.e. none of the reverse translations matched the key term the reverse translation diagnostic module can keep all of the potential translated key terms rather than discarding all of the potential translated key terms.

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example only. Variations of the technique described above are contemplated and are within the scope of the disclosure.

Referring back to the translated key term determination module can selectively adopt a potential translated key term as an acceptable translation based on the geographic location diagnostic the narrow to broad diagnostic the local term diagnostic and or the reverse translation diagnostic. For example the translated key term determination module may provide the one or more potential translated key terms to the geographic location diagnostic module . The geographic location diagnostic module can then perform the geographic location diagnostic and in doing so may discard one or more of the potential translated key terms. The non discarded potential translated key terms can be returned to the translated key term determination module .

The translated key term determination module can provide the potential translated key terms that were not discarded by the geographic location diagnostic module to the reverse translation diagnostic module . The reverse translation diagnostic module can perform a reverse translation diagnostic on the received potential translated key terms and may discard one or more of the received potential translated key terms. The remaining potential translated key terms e.g. the potential translated key terms not discarded by either the reverse translation diagnostic module or the geographic location diagnostic module can be returned to the translated key term determination module .

The translated key term determination module can then provide the key term to the local term diagnostic module which may perform a local term diagnostic on the key term. If the key term is not a local term the remaining potential translated key terms can be provided to the narrow to broad diagnostic module . The narrow to broad diagnostic module can perform the narrow to broad diagnostic on the remaining potential translated key terms and may discard some of the remaining potential translated key terms when determined to be narrow to broad translations.

After the diagnostics have been performed the remaining potential translated key terms can be adopted as translated key terms. It is appreciated that the foregoing sequence is not intended to be limiting and the diagnostics can be performed in any other suitable manner. For example the diagnostics can be performed concurrently such that after the diagnostics are preformed any remaining potential translated key terms may be selectively adopted as translated key terms.

Further additional diagnostics may be performed by the key term determination module . For instance the key term can be analyzed to determine if the key term is a trade name. The key term can be used to provide a query to a trade name database not shown that stores any known trade names such as known trademarks service marks and or business names. If the key term is determined to be a trade name then the key term determination module can obtain a transliteration of the key term in the target language rather than a translation of the key term.

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Further the ordering of the steps disclosed in the technique is not essential and variations of the disclosed technique are contemplated and within the scope of the disclosure.

In the techniques disclosed above the translated key term determination module is described as discarding potential translated key terms based on individual diagnostics. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the translated key term determination module can be configured to determine whether to adopt a potential translated key term as a translated key term based on the collection of diagnostics as well. In these embodiments the geographic location diagnostic module the narrow to broad diagnostic module the local term diagnostic module and the reverse translation diagnostic module can each be configured to generate translation scores for each potential translated key term. The translated key term determination module can determine whether to adopt or discard a potential translated key term based on the translation scores provided from the diagnostic modules and . For example the translated key term determination module can aggregate or average the translation scores corresponding to a potential translated key term and determine whether to adopt or discard the potential translated key term based on whether the aggregated or averaged translation score of the potential translated key term exceeds a predetermined threshold.

In these embodiments each diagnostic module and can be configured to assign a translation score of a potential translated key term based on the diagnostic performed. For instance when the geographic location diagnostic module determines that a potential translated key term geospatially corresponds to the key term the geographic location diagnostic module may assign a relatively high translation score to the potential translated key term. When the geographic location diagnostic module determines that the potential translated key term does not geospatially correspond to the key term the geographic location diagnostic module may assign a relatively low translation to the potential translated key term. When the geographic location diagnostic module determines that the potential translated key term and or the key term do not describe a geographic area the geographic location diagnostic module may assign a relatively neutral score the potential translated key term.

Similarly the narrow to broad diagnostic module can assign a translation score to a potential translated key term. For instance when the narrow to broad diagnostic module determines that a potential translated key term is much broader than the key term the narrow to broad diagnostic module may assign a relatively low translation score can be assigned to the potential translated key term. When however the potential translated key term is not an overly broad translation the narrow to broad diagnostic module may assign a relatively high score to the potential translated key term.

Similarly the reverse translation diagnostic module can assign a translation score to a potential translated key term. For instance when the reverse translation diagnostic module determines that a reverse translation of a potential translated key term matches the key term the reverse translation diagnostic module can assign a relatively high translation score to the potential translated key term. If however the reverse translation does not match the key term the reverse translation diagnostic module can assign a relatively low translation score to the potential translated key term.

In some embodiments the local term diagnostic module can assign a translation score to all of the potential translated key terms based on whether the key term is a local term. For instance when the local term diagnostic module determines that the key term is a local term then the local term diagnostic module can assign a relatively low translation score to all of the potential translated key terms. If the local term diagnostic module determines that the key term is not a local term the local term diagnostic module can assign can assign a relatively high translation score to all of the potential translated key terms.

The translated key term determination module can receive the translation scores of each potential translated key term and determine whether to discard or adopt the potential translated key term based on the received translation scores. Furthermore the translated key term determination module can assign weights to each of the translation scores from each diagnostic module and . For instance greater weight may be given to translation scores received from the reverse translation diagnostic module and lesser weight may be given to translation scores received from the local term diagnostic module .

It is appreciated that the foregoing technique is provided for example and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Furthermore it should be appreciated that the values of the translation scores can be determined in any suitable manner.
