The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 645 806 filed Dec. 23 2009 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present application is in the field of user content management and synchronization for cameras and camcorders with user records maintained at a central node such as at a web server and porting and sharing data content among other devices.

The immense popularity of cameras and camcorders has resulted in ever increasing quantities and types of data that are being stored on cameras and camcorders. Such data includes photo data and other image data video files and video records and other content stored for the user at the camera or camcorder as well as at other types of handheld portable device content data.

Digital cameras camcorders and other video camera equipment store vast amounts of video data. Users often rely on the camera or the camcorder to store their photo images or video files including potentially difficult to replace or precious photos and video records. Thus if the camera or camcorder becomes damaged or lost or if the memory card or other storage medium in the camera video recording device or camcorder becomes damaged or lost then the user s data may be irreplaceably gone. Also if the user purchases a second camera or video recorder and wishes to view photos or videos previously captured on the first camera or video recorder the user would have to typically undertake a cumbersome process of uploading the photos or video files from the first camera or video recorder to a device such as a desktop or laptop computer and then to download the files from the device to the second camera or video recorder. Also sometimes the user may wish to view recent photos or videos taken on the camera or camcorder at home on a desktop or at a friend s house away from home and it may be cumbersome to upload manually the images or the videos each and every time a new image or video is captured by the camera. In a similar vein while traveling the user may wish to view images or videos captured while the camera is being recharged or may wish to view them on a larger monitor or display than is available on a typical digital camera or camcorder. Also a user may wish to view on his her camcorder photos that were captured and stored on a camera or vice versa or may wish to share photos video files or other content with a family member s or friend s device without having to load manually content from one device to another via a third intermediary device such as a desktop laptop computer or by first uploading to some web based storage location.

A camera and another device synchronization system apparatus signaling processor readable medium and method are provided. As an apparatus the invention may include a camera that includes a user content synchronization module for automatically synchronizing image data stored as camera records by the camera with central records stored for the user by a central node remote from the camera the camera records and the central records comprising at least one of photo images or video files the user content synchronization module including a synchronization controller configured to initiate a current synchronization operation a state comparator configured to identify as a changed central record any central records for the user changed deleted or added since a last synchronization operation and to identify as a changed camera record any camera records changed deleted or added since the last synchronization operation the last synchronization operation being a synchronization operation performed most recently prior to the current synchronization operation by the camera the state comparator being further configured to determine whether the changed central record is a corresponding record to the changed camera record the corresponding record being a record that refers to a different version of the same record than another record and to identify as a most recently modified record only one record of a group consisting of the changed central record and the changed camera record and a command generator configured to generate a command queue comprising a command to update based on the most recently modified record the command being a command sent to the central node to update the central records for the user when the most recently modified record is the changed camera record and the command being a command to the camera to update the camera records when the most recently modified record is the changed central record.

Such a camera of claim may also be provided as or include a camcorder for recording video data. The user content synchronization module may include a web access module configured to communicate with the central node via the internet for example content data from the central node may be transmitted as XML data.

The camera may include a wireless communication device configured to connect wirelessly with a Wi Fi port remote from the camera and may include a portal for a wired connection with an internet connection device having a web browser for connecting to the central node via internet for example using a general packet radio service GPRS to communicate via web .

The synchronization controller may initiate automatically the current synchronization operation upon connection with the internet connection device may initiate automatically the current synchronization operation regularly after a predetermined time period.

The user preference module may receive and store a user specified time period wherein the predetermined time period is the user specified time period and the predetermined time period is at least 30 minutes.

A module such as a processor readable medium incorporating a program of instructions configured to run at the central node and configured to manage the central node during the current synchronization is also contemplated.

Such a program at the central node may maintain a deleted camera records folder comprising camera records deleted during the current synchronization operation and recallable upon user command. In the alternative the program at the central node may maintain only thumbnail representations of the deleted camera records for the deleted camera records folder. Also the program at the central node may initiate the current synchronization operation by transmitting a synchronization operation start command to the user content synchronization module. Further the program at the central node may include an off line storage module to synchronize the central records with a second user device the second user device being a device other than the camera. The program at the central node may also include a remote wiper that signals the user content synchronization module to delete all camera records.

The camera may also include a user preference module that receives and stores a user designation of a selected set of camera records the selected set of camera records being exempt from deletion or modification at the camera during the current synchronization operation. The user preference module may receive and store a user selection of a thumbnail synch mode or a full record mode wherein upon selection of the thumbnail synch mode during the current synchronization operation the command generator is configured to store only a thumbnail representation of every camera record that remains in the camera after the current synchronization operation and wherein the upon selection of the full record mode during the current synchronization operation the command generator is configured to store an entire camera record of all camera records that remains in the camera after the current synchronization operation.

The user content synchronization module may include a thumbnail recall to generate upon a user selection of a thumbnail representation a request for the central node to transmit to the camera the central record corresponding to the thumbnail representation for viewing the central record on the camera.

A processor readable medium incorporating a program of instructions configured to run on an internet connection device having a web browser for connecting to the central node via the internet is also described such that the program of instructions manages the internet connection device to connect automatically with the camera via a wired or a wireless connection.

The synchronization controller may initiate automatically the current synchronization operation upon connection with the internet connection device.

In such a camera during the current synchronization operation the command generator may generate a thumbnail representation of every camera record that remains in the camera after the current synchronization operation. During the current synchronization operation the command generator may retain a thumbnail representation of every camera record deleted from the camera during the current synchronization operation.

The synchronization operation module may include a thumbnail recall unit that generates upon a user selection of a thumbnail representation a request for the central node for transmitting to the camera a full image representation of the central record corresponding to the thumbnail representation for viewing the central record on the camera.

A position relay module for the camera is also contemplated that would transmit to the central node for storing in the central records for the user a current position of the camera. The position relay module may transmit the current position at a time of the current synchronization operation. The position relay module may retrieve the current position from a GPS unit integrated with or in wired or wireless communication with the camera.

A location based information module for the camera is also described for providing guide information to the user based on a current position of the camera. The current position of the camera may be detected based on GPS information or based on scene recognition of a scene viewed by the camera.

Also described is a system an apparatus signaling or a set of signals a processor readable medium and a method for synchronizing user content between a first user device and a second user device over the internet via a central node. As a system the invention includes a first user content synchronization module positioned in the first user device and configured to synchronize automatically the user content uploaded via the internet to the central node from the second user device a second user content synchronization module positioned in the second user device and configured to synchronize with the first user device by uploading via the internet the user content to the central node a third user content synchronization module positioned at the central node and configured to transmit automatically to the first user device the user content and a user preference module configured to receive a user command for initiating synchronization by activating the second user content synchronization module.

The user preference module may include a processor readable medium incorporating a program of instructions positioned in the first user device or in the second user device.

The user preference module may initiate the synchronization automatically and immediately each time user content is received at the second user device or may initiate the synchronization with regularly occurring frequency.

The first user content synchronization module may perform a current two way synchronization operation such that a first device file of the user content stored at the first user device is updated automatically by any corresponding user content added changed or deleted at the central node and such that a central file of user content stored at the central node is updated automatically by any corresponding user content added changed or deleted at the first user device.

Also the first user content synchronization module may perform the current two way synchronization operation each time the first device file or the central file is added changed or deleted. The first user content synchronization module may perform the current two way synchronization operation with regularly occurring frequency.

In addition in such a system the second user content synchronization module may perform a current two way synchronization operation such that a second device file of the user content stored at the second user device is updated automatically by any corresponding user content added changed or deleted at the central node and such that a central file of user content stored at the central node is updated automatically by any corresponding user content added changed or deleted at the second user device.

For example the first user device may be a mobile communication device and the second user device may be a television a gaming device and or a mobile communication device.

The first user content synchronization module may also include a virtual device controller to receive user commands for controlling the second user device and to transmit signals via the central node for controlling the second user device based on the user commands received.

Thus the first user device may be a mobile communication device and the second user device may be a television.

In addition the first user device may be a mobile communication device the second user device may be a gaming device and the first user content synchronization module may include a virtual device controller to receive user commands for controlling the second user device and to transmit signals via the central node for controlling the second user device based on the user commands received.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention with reference to the accompanying Drawings.

With reference to the Drawings features of the invention are described in the detailed description section.

Synchronization application may initiate the synchronization operation at the expiration of a predetermined time period at a particular time of the day week month etc. or at a particular hour every day. The synchronization application includes a synchronization controller that initiates the synchronization application. Further the synchronization operation may be commenced by the user or according to an aspect of Applicant s invention the central synchronization application may push initiate the synchronization operation by transmitting a synch operation request to the synchronization controller of the synchronization application in the camera camcorder . Also synchronization controller may initiate the synchronization operation upon the occurrence of an event such as upon the addition of new user content or modification or deletion of existing user content or upon the occurrence of user action such as snapping a photograph or activating the record function of the video camera or camera camcorder .

Camera camcorder may communicate with the central node via a Wi Fi connection if the camera camcorder is equipped with a Wi Fi communication module or chip or via base station A B of a wireless cellular network. Alternatively or in addition to the wired or wireless connection to the Wi Fi communication and or the wireless cellular network the camera camcorder may be connected using a wired or wireless connection to an internet connection device such as a communication device . Such a device may be a desktop laptop television unit or a handheld device or another communication terminal that includes a modem that is able to communicate with the internet. Camera or camcorder may have one or more network interfaces for example one or more network interface cards NIC or a network controller and the network interface may include a personal area network PAN interface providing bluetooth UWB ultrawideband network IEEE 802.15.4 for example ZigBee or the like functionality for communication with device . For example GPRS may be used to communicate via the web .

Also the synchronization operation may be automatically commenced when the camera camcorder is connected to the communication device . According to an aspect of Applicant s invention all synchronization operations may be performed using HTTP and the OSI model as a packet based RESTful paradigm. The synchronization server may be implemented as a processor cloud that includes a series of processors and may include a synchronization application that provides functionality for synchronization at the central node components of which are shown in . The synchronization server may also be attached to a database which too may be implemented as a data storage cloud or a set of servers connected to the web .

Synchronization application may include a user preference module that accepts user specified instructions for commencing the synchronization operation so that the user may be empowered to select to have the synchronization operation start automatically at a certain time of the day week or month upon the expiration of a certain interval of time upon connection to the communication device upon connection to the web when the Wi Fi communication port of the camera camcorder is in a Wi Fi hotspot enabling communication with Wi Fi connection or the like. When the synchronization operation is commenced by the synchronization application an authentication may be carried out by authenticator in communication with authenticator of synchronization server of the central node.

Although synchronization server is shown as a unit distinct from wireless provider according to an aspect of Applicant s invention wireless carrier or network provider may provide the synchronization service and may thus house or provide synchronization server . According to an aspect of Applicant s invention user preference module may provide an automatic default setting for a timing of synchronization operations and user preference module may have a minimum threshold for example five minutes that cannot be overridden by the user that must elapse between synchronization operations. Also a thirty minute or an hour minimum interval setting may be provided as the pre set minimum time as the lowest acceptable setting that may be set by the user for the user preference module .

Synchronization application of camera camcorder may perform a two way synchronization operation with synchronization server of the central node by comparing any newly added deleted manually changed or automatically updated camera records stored in camera camcorder with newly added deleted manually changed or automatically updated camera records for the user maintained at synchronization server of the central node. As part of the synchronization operation synchronization application may identify records of camera camcorder that correspond with the records for the user maintained at synchronization server of the central node and generate a command queue for updating based on the most recent records the corresponding records maintained at the other device. That is when a photo image or video file or a version or an edited duplication of a photo image or video file of the camera camcorder is deemed to be newer or to have been deleted added or changed more recently than a corresponding photo image or a video file or a version or an edited duplication of a photo image or video file maintained at synchronization server of the central node then the corresponding record of synchronization server will be updated. Conversely when the photo image or video file or a version or an edited duplication of a photo image or video file maintained at synchronization server is found to be more recent than the corresponding photo image or video file or a version or an edited duplication of a photo image or video file maintained at camera camcorder then the corresponding record maintained by camera camcorder will be updated as part of the automatic synchronization operation. Or if a corresponding photo video file or other record is found to have been more recently deleted than that photo video file or other record may be deleted also on the remaining device. It will be understood that other types of synchronization operations may be performed to achieve the synchronization discussed herein.

At step S the central node is requested to provide all fields of user data that have been changed since the most recent synchronization operation and the data time of the most recent change or update of each field that has been changed. GETcompare may be a method call requesting a list of all records associated with the requesting camera camcorder of the user and maintained at the central node that have been changed added or deleted since the most recent synchronization operation.

At S in fields that have been changed may be stored temporarily by the synchronization application in the camera camcorder . Similarly at F a File System Changes Log is generated or read out. This log represents all fields of the user content stored on the camera camcorder that have changed since the most recent synchronization operation.

Such a File Systems Changes Log may be generated in several ways for example a background process may be running that adds each file system change in the camera camcorder to the log or at run time during the synchronization operation or just before the synchronization operation the files may be scanned and those fields that have changed since the most synchronization operation may be added to the log. The latter approach may be more applicable for the first synchronization operation and would be less susceptible to a catching changed field if the program had been turned off.

At S the corresponding fields of the records obtained from the central node and the file system changes log are determined. Such corresponding fields of the user record may be obtained for example if each field of user content is indexed by a searchable key. Then at S for each corresponding record a determination is made as to which version the version that had been maintained by the central node or the version that had been maintained by the camera camcorder is the most recent version. This determination is made in this example based on the date time stamp associated with each field of the user data of the GETcompare results and the File System Changes Log. If at S the version maintained at synchronization is determined to be more recent then a command is generated and added to a command queue to update content stored by the camera camcorder . Alternatively if the camera camcorder version is determined to be more recent for that field of the user data content then a command is generated and added to the command queue to request that synchronization server update the data stored at the central node including by the database or the data storage cloud S .

As shown in S the commands on the command queue are executed one after another. As shown in the flowchart of two command queues may be generated one at S containing the GET commands for obtaining data of the central node and updating the camera camcorder user content and one at S containing the POST commands for updating the central node user content. At S a determination is made as to whether there was an error. If a GET error was made then the command is reposted to the GETqueue and if a POST error is made then the command is put back on the POSTqueue S. It will be understood that while described using method calls of one computer language many other types of command syntax are possible. Also while the synchronization operation is described with reference to the approach illustrated in it will be readily understood that many other types of synchronization operation are known that will make possible the update of a field of user data that has been changed by a user in order to automatically update with new information that has been added or to remove data has been deleted to a less recent corresponding field.

At S commands effecting residual records are added to queues of residual commands a residual get queue is generated at S and a residual post queue is generated at S and these command queues are added to respective command queues performed at the next synchronization operation except that if a field effected by such residual command is more subsequently updated after the current synchronization operation then residual commands are not executed. At S the timer for starting the next synchronization operation is reset such that for example if a synchronization operation is set to be commenced every hour than the timer is set for an hour starting from the completion of the current synchronization operation. According to an aspect of Applicant s invention user preference module may provide an automatic default setting for a timing of synchronization operations and user preference module may have a minimum threshold for example five minutes that must elapse between synchronization operations. Also a thirty minute or an hour minimum interval setting may be provided as the minimum time that may be set by the user by user preference module .

A basic outline of steps executed during a synchronization operation is illustrated in . At Sign Up an SMS short message service message or other such communication may be sent to the camera camcorder with a link to install the application. At Compare camera camcorder sends a command to the central node Web which replies with XML data required to synchronize. At Synch from Camera camera camcorder passes data to the central node with the central node transmitting confirmation. At Synch from Web the camera camcorder is requesting data from the central node. Change Settings is provided to update user account details from the camera camcorder .

Central synchronization application of synchronization server of the central node may include a file saver that automatically saves all photo images or video files deleted from camera camcorder as part of the current synchronization operation and that generates a special folder for such saved files. Thus the user may wish later to recall such a deleted file from the saved file folder. Such a feature could be useful in case the user mistakenly deleted the photo images or video files at camera camcorder and then during the synchronization operation such deleted files would have been permanently removed from both camera camcorder and synchronization server .

Synchronization application at camera camcorder may include user preference module that receives a user designation of a first set of images that the user may also wish to keep stored at camera camcorder and the user may wish to exempt all such images or video records from being deleted or modified during synchronization operations. For example the user may have a photo displayed as a screen saver or a group of photos to be shown at camera camcorder for friends that the user wishes to exempt from synchronization or from deletion.

In addition the user may wish to select a thumbnail mode in which during the synchronization operation all photo images or video files that remain in camera camcorder after the synchronization operation are maintained only as thumbnails at the camera. Depending on the size of the memory of camera camcorder a very high number of such thumbnail representations could be stored at the camera thus greatly increasing the number of images that may be held. Further synchronization application may include a thumbnail recall that accepts a user selection of a selected thumbnail representation stored on the camera camcorder and generates a request transmitted to the synchronization server for providing the full photo image or full video file corresponding to the thumbnail representation selected by the user. Thus at any time the user may view the photo image or video file at camera camcorder returned from the synchronization server . Such a full photo image may be stored by camera camcorder indefinitely only while it is being viewed or played at the camera camcorder after it is received or for some user defined period. In this way a virtual memory of camera camcorder may be extended a great deal by the use of only thumbnail representations maintained at camera camcorder .

In the alternative user preference module may accept the user selection of a full representation synchronization mode such that the synchronization operation leaves an entire photo image or video file for all the records of the camera that remain in the camera after the current synchronization operation.

In addition the photo images video files or the thumbnail representations may be organized or may be accessible using user specified filters such as date time or location of capture of the photo image or video file. In addition the photo images video files or thumbnail representations may be tagged and separated into groups based on associations of records thought desirable by the user. Thus the user may wish to tag for a custom folder all photo images video files or a thumbnail representation of a certain person place or the like. In a similar vein the user may select for synchronization with the central node only photo images or video files contained within a particular folder or those tagged and separated into a particular group grouped by for example date time of capture or location of capture person or persons depicted in the photo image or video file type of photo e.g. portrait day or night flash or no flash landscape black and white or color or the like .

Also user preference module may allow the user to select a mode in which photo images or video files deleted from the camera during the synchronization operation are nevertheless maintained in a special thumbnail folder of camera camcorder . Thus camera camcorder nevertheless could retain a thumbnail representation of photo images or video files that were automatically deleted or changed as part of the synchronization operation in the special thumbnail folder.

Further according to a further aspect of the disclosure if the user loses the camera camcorder the user may initiate a remote data wipe of all photo images video files thumbnail representations user preferences or other user content or information stored in the camera camcorder by initiating a data wipe operation at the synchronization server . Thus central synchronization application may provide a command issued from local controller for deleting all records stored on camera camcorder upon a special instruction received via web from the terminal of the user. Thus the user may visit synchronization server for example via the web interface in case camera camcorder becomes lost or damaged and initiate a request from the synchronization server to delete all user records stored by the camera camcorder . According to an aspect of the disclosure such a data wipe operation would terminate further synchronization operations between camera camcorder and the central node so as to prevent loss of data held for the user at the central node. In this way if the camera camcorder is found by an unscrupulous person all user data stored at the camera camcorder will have been deleted. However should the user obtain a replacement camera camcorder then user data stored at the central node can be downloaded to the replacement camera camcorder through an ordinary synchronization operation or using a special synchronization operation initiated by the user without burdening user without having to replace the data manually. 

Also camera may be connected via a wired or wireless connection or maybe integrated with a GPS device and may automatically transmit a position of the camera camcorder to synchronization server . Synchronization server may store the location of camera camcorder and may manage a file that contains a running list of most recent camera camcorder locations. In addition a location of camera camcorder may be obtained using methods other than a GPS device for example using Wi Fi connection port A B triangulation or base station A B triangulation or direct signaling provided by Wi Fi connection A B or base station A B for informing of the location. For example GPRS general packet radio service may be used as a means of communication via the web and the position of the camera camcorder may be performed accordingly. Also location also may be determined based on a scene recognized by camera camcorder using scene recognition software.

Similarly the user may use another terminal such as desktop terminal laptop television unit portable communication device or a handheld device to view or manage photo images or video files maintained at the synchronization server of the central node. Thus the user may wish to add delete change manually such as using a photo manipulation or video file manipulation application the photo images and video files maintained at the synchronization server of the central node. Such changes additions or deletions would then be reflected in the camera content after the next synchronization operation.

Terminal may include a monitor as part of the physical user interface such as a CRT television monitor flat screen monitor OLED LCD LED or plasma display front projection or rear projection display or the like. Similarly camera camcorder may have one or more such monitors or displays integrated therewith or integrated with communication device .

Also shown in is auxiliary device which may be a keyboard computer gaming device headphone connected to user terminal using a wired or wireless connection. Thus auxiliary device may have its own display that controls and its own storage such that data stored at user terminal may also be saved at auxiliary device .

Also shown in is a database which may be implemented as a data storage cloud for storing user records. The synchronization server may be implemented as a processor cloud. Database may be connected directly to the synchronization server or may be connected to a synchronization server via web . The synchronization server may be provided as a stand alone service that is purchased or subscribed to by the user of the camera camcorder or the synchronization server and the database may be provided by the manufacturer or seller of the camera camcorder as part of the purchase of the camera camcorder . Such services may be provided for an additional lump sum payment or for periodic subscription fee.

Synchronization server may be accessed by a parent or guardian to monitor user content of camera camcorder because the central node would automatically synchronize with camera camcorder . Thus by accessing for example via a website synchronization server of the central node the parent could monitor the photo images or video files stored on the camera camcorder . Also synchronization server may include user settings to control user content such as porn filters or other filters for user content and may flag or prevent the storage of all such objectionable content.

In addition the user may interface using user interface with user terminal connected via the web for communication with the synchronization server and user terminal may also store all or some of the photo images or video files stored on camera camcorder . According to this aspect of the invention during each synchronization operation or following each synchronization operation between camera camcorder and synchronization server of the central node user terminal may also be updated and synchronized with the most recent version of the photo images and video files.

In addition or in the alternative user terminal may have a separate synchronization application that separately synchronizes with the central node at regular intervals or at other specified times so that the user terminal maintains the most recent version of all photo images or video files. In addition or in the alternative user terminal may be synchronized each time user terminal is activated or each time user terminal is connected to the web . User terminal may also be connected to another device via a wired or wireless connection and this other device may be a television a second camera or camcorder a handheld device a mobile communication such as a cellular phone notebook or a tablet terminal and all information that is monitored on the terminal may also be monitored or may be monitored exclusively on monitored device .

Also contemplated is a camera to camera photo image or video file sharing feature. Two or more users may wish to share remotely photos or video files upon the request of one of the users. For example a first user may wish to initiate a request to a second user to access all or some designated group of the photo images or video files of the second user. If the second user grants permission then the first user is granted permission to view those photo images or video files. Such a request from the first user and such a response from the second user may be input using synchronization server at the central node and transmitted to each camera or can be input to the camera camcorder and transmitted to the second camera directly or via the central node. Such a request may be made for a one time share or may be a request to share automatically all such for user content in the future.

Also a site recognition feature is contemplated in which people companies states governments organizations or other entities can submit various images including photos or video files of certain locations or landmarks that are of geographical historical political or other interest. When a user points camera toward a landmark of geographic or historic significance the camera may use recognition software to identify the landmark and a message can be provided to the user on the camera screen with text identifying the name and other important information about the landmark. The recognition may be performed either using recognition software or based on a determination that the current location of the camera is at or approximately at the location of the registered landmark of geographic or historical significance. The message to the user on the camera may be in the form of a text message or may be a semi opaque overlay of the landmark. While described as a landmark or a building it would be understood that such a landmark can consist of landscape of ecological or historical significance such as a nature preserve or a park.

Similarly the information uploaded and preset may be information of interest to the user about a particular location building or landmark and when a determination is made that the camera is at or near the landmark the information could be presented to the user just as would be presented by a brochure or a tour guide. Also other related points of interest nearby could be made available or presented to the user via camera .

Also contemplated is a system in which many such devices are all synchronized at the central node such that upon selection by the user of the device or of types of content of a device all such designated user content may be synchronized at the central node to all other selected devices or to any device designated by the user. Thus the user may wish to view pictures or video data or recordings captured by camera A B on the mobile device A B and in addition or instead on the television A B.

The camera may include a landmark guide information module D that stores information about various sites such as landmarks or other geographic or architectural points of significance or sights and includes information such as would be useful for a tourist or a visitor of the site or information about neighboring sites to be recommended for the user such as other similar or related landmarks restaurants or hotels airports or the like which may be provided to the user in the form of textual information textual marquis at the bottom of the camera screen or as an opaque or semi opaque overlay over the site. For example the overlay may include a picture or other image or representation of a building that is associated with or corresponds to the recognized site taken during a historically significant time or taken from an advantageous or aesthetically pleasing perspective or angle. In the alternative such information may be streamed from the central node based on the site recognized by the recognition software C at the camera A B. Also the camera may include a module for filtering photographs or video recordings such as filtering such photos or video recordings by date time or location of capture or according to whether the image or video file is of a person or a landscape or a group of people or whether it was taken at night or by day or in the U.S. or outside the U.S. or other such criteria.

Also the user may also be able to tag each photo or video file with such indexing information so that such photos or video files may be associated together and recalled as a group or recalled individually based on a search entered by the user and keyed by such tagging information.

Also synchronization may be performed automatically each time user content for any designated synchronized device is changed updated added or deleted. Such event driven synchronization may be performed in addition to or instead of synchronization at set time intervals or at pre specified times. Thus the user may wish to perform synchronization with a device such as a camera A B which is less frequently used or for which data stored is less frequently changed added or deleted or for which content files include larger amounts of data and thus require more bandwidth and storage space only upon the occurrence of a content changing event such as the addition deletion or the editing of user content. Also the user may wish to port user data or other content immediately only in one direction between designated devices. For example the user may wish to view television content received by the television A on the mobile terminal but not to view content of the mobile device on the television A and thus the user may set for only one way synchronization.

Also while shown as mobile communication devices A and B cameras A B televisions A B and television auxiliary device other types of devices may also be used to view synchronized content or to supply synchronized content. For example such platforms may include printer devices medical surgical equipment electronic pens radio devices electronic shavers electronic personal care device lighting systems fixtures refrigerators microwave ovens security systems home or business air conditioning systems heating systems electronic book readers home or business entertainment systems headphones gaming devices electronic billboards signs cook top stoves electronic picture frames elevators electronic tables dishwashers washer dryer laundry units small to mid size kitchen appliances electronic planners electronic calendars car computer systems and dashboard displays wall mounted electric systems aviation systems boating computer systems electronic toothbrushes digital recorders DVD player blue ray players cable satellite set top box device remote control units handheld sky caddie golf device GPS golf cart with or without sky caddie built in home auto alarm systems car rear camera obstacle detector portable automobile TV on board bicycle racer computer landline phones electronic doors paper shredder electric reclining chair treadmills and workout bikes vending machines ticketing machines toll commuter fair machines or turnpikes pedometer built into shoe cash register coin counting machines DVD renting units self checkout machines.

For example the user may wish to watch television content received at or stored at television A on mobile communication device or cellular telephone A or on camera A. Thus the user may wish to initiate a porting of data received at or stored at television A via synchronization server by initiating a one way synchronization in which any new content received by television A is transmitted via the central node to the mobile communication device A and or to the camera A. In addition or in the alternative user may initiate such one way synchronization by setting a command at television A to transmit in real time or upon the completion of receipt of an entire television program or other video file to the synchronization server via the web . The synchronization server would automatically forward such content to the mobile communication A and or the camera A. In the alternative synchronization server may store any such television content or video file until the file is complete or the television program is finished uploading and then transmit the video file or television program to the mobile telephone A and or to camera A.

In addition synchronization application illustrated in also may include a virtual device controller B provided in the mobile communication device A and or camera A to receive user command intended for directing or controlling television A so that the user may be allowed to transmit commands via the central node to the television A from the mobile communication device A and or camera A to change the channel program a video recorder integrated with or provided separate from television A change a reception frequency or timing of a transmission from television A change a volume setting or the like. While described in the above described example as a mobile communication device A or as a camera A it would be understood that other devices may be provided for receiving the ported data such as one or more of the devices above listed.

Also user may wish to view mobile communication user content on television A or other such device and may wish to add change update or delete such user content or the communication device A. For example user may wish to view picture data video files or other image data or change or monitor contact information stored on mobile device A on camera A or on such other device. This may be accomplished by transmitting such mobile device content data via synchronization server to the remote device A. This may be accomplished with some regular frequency for example as part of a one way or a two way synchronization between mobile communication device A and television A or when requested by a user of television A or such one way or two way synchronization may occur automatically each time any mobile communication data is added changed deleted or updated at the mobile communication device A.

Similarly the user may wish to view and or participate in a game played at a gaming device connected with or integrated to television B from a remote location using the mobile communication device A and or camera A. Thus the user may wish to play a game currently playing on gaming device and may also wish to send instructions for directing the ball or in other ways directing action in the game using the interface provided at mobile communication device A and or camera A. Thus virtual device controller B of synchronization application may receive such user commands intended for directing action at a gaming device and may then transmit them via synchronization server over the web to a gaming device and or to connected television B.

Thus synchronization as described in the foregoing description and thumbnailing of picture and video files may provide for reduced reliance on the memory of the camera camcorder and or may require a smaller memory of the camera camcorder and a more streamlined camera camcorder may be obtainable.

Also user preference module may receive user commands for controlling what devices are to be included in the synchronization group and for controlling what types of user content files are to be included in the synchronization group. Thus user may wish to select a number of devices for synchronization all of which are to share all data using a two way synchronization at regular intervals or upon the change deletion or addition of any file at any of the synchronization group devices. In the alternative user may wish to a select certain device for example camera camcorder for one way synchronization such that picture data or video files captured by camera camcorder are backed up by synchronization server at regular intervals or upon the capture change or deletion or such picture data or video files. At the same time user may wish not to have two way synchronization if user wishes to set the camera camcorder not receive user content from other devices for synchronization. In the alternative user may wish to synchronize video files of the camera camcorder but not photographic images or vice versa.

Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred therefore that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein but only by the appended claims.
