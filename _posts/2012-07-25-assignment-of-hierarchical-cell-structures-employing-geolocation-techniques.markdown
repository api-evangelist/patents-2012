title: Assignment of hierarchical cell structures employing geolocation techniques
abstract: Distance is employed to facilitate sector selection and re-selection in a network during handoff. A system receives measurement information for a mobile device. The measurement information includes information indicative of a geographical location of the mobile device. The system determines information indicative of a geographical location of a cell site to which the mobile device is assigned. The system then selects a sector of the cell site with which to associate the mobile device. The selection of the sector is based, at least, on a distance determined between the mobile device and the cell site. In various embodiments, the distance information is determined based on the latitude and longitude of the mobile device. In various embodiments, the morphology of the terrain for the area in which the mobile device is located is factored into the determination of the sector.

The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and more particularly to various embodiments that facilitate assignment of hierarchical cell structures employing geolocation techniques.

In wireless mobility engineering the term near far generally refers to a condition in which mobile devices very close to a radio transceiver base station BS present noise levels that mask other signals that the radio transceiver BS may need to acquire. One may incorrectly assume that signals from mobile devices on different frequencies are isolated from one another and therefore do not interfere with one another. However both mobile device and BS radio transmissions can occupy a power mask that specifies filter characteristics of the transmitted signals. These specifications can allow a small portion of transmitted power to leak into adjacent frequencies. When both mobile devices are at roughly the same distance from the radio BS this leakage is insignificant and may not impair signal receiving. However as one mobile device moves farther away from the radio BS the signal strength of the signal from the mobile device can drop. As such the ratio of the signal power from the mobile device to the power leakage from an adjacent frequency can be reduced. As the mobile device on the adjacent frequency moves closer to the radio BS the ratio can be further reduced. Eventually the ratio can be reduced to the extent that the receipt of a signal from a mobile device further from the radio BS can be impaired.

Generally as mobile devices approach a radio BS the transmissions of the mobile devices are powered down thereby reducing the near far effect. As such when more than one mobile device is served by the same radio BS the near far effect is minimal and not considered a primary driver of call performance. However when a mobile device that is near a particular radio BS is served by a distance radio BS the mobile device may not be powered down. This is the condition that can present the performance affecting near far effect.

This performance affecting near far effect can exist when a mobile device using another telecommunication company service is being served by a radio BS that may be miles away causing the mobile device to transmit at high power right next to a nearby radio BS associated with another telecommunications company service.

This performance affecting near far effect can also exist when different mobile radio network access technologies e.g. Global System for Mobile Communications GSM Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS are used in the same network but are not equipped on all BSs within that network. For example a mobile device may be using UMTS radio access technology and may move into close proximity of a BS not equipped with UMTS radio access technology. Since the mobile device cannot make a handoff to a UMTS radio on that BS the mobile device will transmit at a power level much higher than would be the case if the BS was equipped with a UMTS radio. This configuration often occurs during network wide roll out of a new radio access technology and there is a temporal factor in all radio BSs being equipped with the new technology. During the intervening period the sparseness of radio deployments on the new technology are generally referred to as a Swiss cheese network where the holes imply BSs not having the new access technology radios.

These embodiments are indicative however of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the embodiments can be employed. Other features of the embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description of the embodiments when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

In one or more embodiments a method can include receiving by a system including a processor measurement information relating to a mobile device wherein the measurement information includes first information indicative of a geographical location of the mobile device determining by the system second information indicative of a geographical location of a cell site to which the mobile device is assigned and selecting by the system a sector of the cell site with which to associate the mobile device wherein the selecting is based at least on a distance determined between the mobile device and the cell site.

In one or more embodiments a non transitory computer readable storage medium can store computer executable instructions that in response to execution cause a system including a processor to perform operations.

In one or more embodiments a system can include a memory that stores computer executable instructions and a processor communicatively coupled to the memory that facilitates execution of computer executable instructions to determine a distance between a mobile device and a cell site and determine one of a plurality of sectors of the cell site to assign the mobile device based at least on the distance.

A hierarchical cell structure HCS is a type of cell structure that allows the network to use the geographical area and serve an increasing population. In some embodiments the HCS can include a cell site associated with a BS and one or more sectors associated with the cell site. Each sector can operate on a different frequency.

Currently the technique employed for HCS assignment applies assignment of HCSs based on power load and utilization of sectors to select a low capacity sector to perform handoffs and cell re selection. In the embodiments described herein selection and or re selection of sectors is performed. The selection and or re selection is based at least on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site.

In various embodiments the mobile devices in a network can receive and transmit signals to a cell site. As the mobile device moves from one location to another the signal reception can be handed over to a cell site that is near to the mobile device in order to maintain signal strength and correspondingly good reception. In the embodiments described herein sector selection and or re selection can be based on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site as opposed to being based on the power of the received signal.

Attributes such as latitude and longitude of the mobile device and the current cell site associated with a mobile device can be obtained from a central geolocation engine. For example the latitude and longitude of the current cell site can be obtained from an internal database that stores locations of all cell sites and or locations of mobile devices.

Distance calculations can be performed before the selection of the sector and based at least on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site the system can assign to the mobile device a sector or layer of the cell site.

If the distance between the mobile device and the cell site is less than a threshold value which can be predefined based at least on the morphology of the terrain for the area in which the mobile device is traveling the mobile device is assigned to a first sector. The mobile device can be assigned to a second sector if the distance is greater than the threshold value. Rural areas can have higher threshold values than urban areas.

In some embodiments a rural area can be an area that has less than a predefined number of buildings and or more than a predefined amount of cropland water or marshland. In some embodiments a rural area can be defined by an area having less than a predefined population density e.g. less than 1 000 persons per square mile or a predefined population e.g. less than 2 500 persons .

In some embodiments an urban area can be an area that has more than a predefined number of buildings and or less than a predefined amount of cropland water or marshland. In some embodiments an urban area can be defined by an area having more than a predefined population density e.g. greater than or equal to 1 000 persons per square mile or a predefined population e.g. greater than 50 000 persons .

In some embodiments a predefined list can exist that correlates particular areas with the designation of either a rural area or an urban area.

In some embodiments the morphology can be dictated by one or more critical points of a terrain and critical lines joining the critical points. In some embodiments the morphology of a terrain can be dictated by one or more of the values of the following parameters in an area building density building height roof reflectivity e.g. bright or dark impervious surface reflectivity bare ground cropland grassland marshland water number and height of coniferous trees number and height of evergreen trees number and height of deciduous trees number and height of shrubs. If a certain number of particular features exist or exist at an average height the morphology of the terrain can be urban or rural depending on the features .

The first sector can be a near sector and the second sector can be a far sector. For example if a distance is less than a threshold a near sector can be assigned. The near sector e.g. sector of a three sector cell can be a sector that operates on higher frequencies e.g. 1900 Megahertz MHz in some embodiments. The far sector e.g. sector can be a sector that operates on lower frequencies e.g. 850 MHz .

One or more of the embodiments can employ innovating HCS based techniques for sector selection and re selection based at least on the distance between the cell site and the mobile device to address the near far problem. By employing the systems and methods described herein for selection and or handoffs call quality can be increased noise can be reduced and or call drops can be mitigated. Various embodiments can advantageously facilitate balancing of traffic load avoidance or reduction of congestion and general improvement in network performance.

Referring to the system can include a mobile device configured to transmit signals to BSs . The BSs can cover the geographical regions corresponding to cell sites respectively.

BS can be split into different sectors in some embodiments. Each sector can have a corresponding frequency on which communication occurs. For example sector one can correspond to 850 MHz and sector two can correspond to 1900 MHz. In various embodiments the mobile devices can be assigned to different sectors of the cell site. In various embodiments the mobile devices can be switched between the different sectors upon re selection of sectors.

As shown in a first cell site can correspond to the geographical region covered by BS and a second cell site can correspond to the geographical region covered by BS . Each of cell site can be divided into multiple sectors. For example cell site can be divided into a near sector e.g. a sector near the BS and a far sector . Cell site can be divided into near sector and far sector . For each sector 

Each sector can have an associated frequency over which communication between a BS and the mobile device can occur. For example in some embodiments one of the sectors of cell site can be associated with a frequency of 1900 MHz over which communication with the BS occurs and another one of the sectors can be associated with a frequency of 850 MHz over which communication with the BS occurs. As such the mobile device can communicate over the frequency associated with either of the sectors . In various embodiments the mobile device communicates over the sector to which the mobile device is assigned.

In some embodiments the system can facilitate assignment of a sector of a cell site associated with BSs to the mobile device . For example the sector can be assigned to the mobile device upon handoff of the mobile device from one cell site to another cell site. The system can facilitate assignment of the sector based at least on the distance between the mobile device and the BS. For example if the distance between the mobile device and the BS is less than distance the mobile device can be assigned to a first sector . If the distance is greater than distance the mobile device can be assigned to a second sector .

In one embodiment the sector to which the mobile device is assigned can be determined by the BS covering the geographical region of the cell site to which the sectors are associated. The BS can communicate information to the mobile device for communicating on such sector frequency.

In another embodiment the sector to which the mobile device is assigned can be determined by a system distinct from the BS covering the geographical region of the cell site to which the sectors are associated. For example in some embodiments a central system not shown can receive information from BS informing the central system that the mobile device requires handoff to BS from BS . The central system can determine a sector to which to assign the mobile device based on the information provided by the BS .

Accordingly upon handoff from BS to BS a sector of the cell is selected for mobile device communication with the BS . Systems and methods for selection of the sector can be as described in further detail herein and also with reference to .

Turning now to the sector assignment system is shown and can include a communication component assignment component memory processor and or data storage .

For example the measurement information can include but is not limited to a geographical location at which the mobile device is located at the time that the measurement information is obtained.

In various embodiments the measurement information can include latitude and longitude information indicating the geographical location of the mobile device a city or street address at which the mobile device is located and or any other of a number of different indicia of geographical location.

In some embodiments wherein the sector assignment system is located at a BS the sector assignment system can obtain the measurement information from a central system remote from the BS. The central system can collect measurement information for a number of different mobile devices for example and provide such information to the BS upon request.

In some embodiments the BS can store previously obtained measurement information in data storage e.g. data storage at the BS and need not request measurement information from the central system. For example in some embodiments the communication component can detect signals transmitted from the mobile device and can retrieve the measurement information from such signals detected by the BS.

In various embodiments the BS can obtain the measurement information upon determining that the mobile device e.g. mobile device requires handoff to the BS or at any time other than those associated with handoff. For example in various embodiments the BS can obtain measurement information for a mobile device while a call is in progress at the mobile device or while no call is in progress at the mobile device.

In some embodiments wherein the sector assignment system is located at a central system distinct from the BS the sector assignment system can access measurement information for the mobile device stored at the central system at any time and or upon receiving information or a request to transmit the measurement information to a BS.

The sector assignment system can also include an assignment component . The assignment component can determine a sector of a cell site to which to assign a mobile device. The structure and or functionality the assignment component can be as described in greater detail with reference to or vice versa .

Turning now to the assignment component can include a mobile device location component a cell site location component a sector selection component a memory a processor and or a data storage . In various embodiments one or more of the mobile device location component cell site location component sector selection component memory processor and or data storage can be electrically and or communicatively coupled to one another to perform one or more of the functions of the assignment component .

The mobile device location component can access and or retrieve measurement information about a mobile device within geographical proximity to the cell site of interest. For example in some embodiments when handoff is scheduled to take place from a first BS to a second BS the mobile device location component can access and or retrieve measurement information about the geographical location of the mobile device.

The mobile device location component can access and or retrieve the measurement information from a central system remote from the assignment component in some embodiments. In some embodiments the mobile device location component can access and or retrieve the measurement information from the mobile device and or from the data storage .

In various embodiments the geographical location information accessed and or retrieved by the mobile device location component can include latitude and or longitude of the geographical location of the mobile device and or a city or street address corresponding to the geographical location of the mobile device.

The cell site location component can access and or retrieve information indicative of one or more cell sites. For example the information can include a latitude and longitude of the one or more cell sites. In embodiments wherein the assignment component is located at the BS the cell site location component can access and or retrieve information indicative of a location of the BS. In various embodiments the cell site location can be the location of the BS for the cell site.

The cell site location component can access and or retrieve the measurement information from a central system remote from the assignment component in some embodiments. In some embodiments the cell site location component can access and or retrieve the measurement information from the data storage .

The sector selection component can determine a sector of the cell site to which to assign the mobile device. In various embodiments the sector selection component can determine the sector during handoff of the mobile device during a time that the mobile device is on a call during a time that the mobile device is not on a call or in any number of different instances as long as measurement information for the mobile device and geographical location information for the cell site are known.

The sector selection component can assign the sector based at least on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site.

In some embodiments the sector selection component can access the measurement information for the mobile device from the mobile device location component and access the geographical location of the cell site from the cell site location component . The sector selection component can calculate the distance between the mobile device and the cell site.

In some embodiments the sector selection component can determine whether the distance between the mobile device and the cell site is less than a threshold value. If the distance is less than the threshold value the sector selection component can assign the mobile device to a first sector of the cell site. If the distance is greater than or equal to the threshold value the sector selection component can assign the mobile device to a second sector of the cell site.

In various embodiments the first sector can be a sector nearer to the BS of the cell than the second sector. For example referring back to the first sector can be the sector for cell site and the second sector can be the sector for the cell site . As such if the distance between the mobile device e.g. mobile device and the cell site e.g. cell site is less than the threshold value e.g. distance the sector selection component can assign the mobile device e.g. mobile device to sector . If the distance is greater than or equal to the threshold value e.g. distance the sector selection component can assign the mobile device e.g. mobile device to sector .

In various embodiments the sector nearer the BS can be associated with a higher frequency e.g. 1900 MHz than the sector farther away from the BS.

In some embodiments the sector selection component can determine the threshold value based on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site as a function of the morphology of the area in which the mobile device is located. For example if the mobile device is located in a rural area the threshold value can be greater than if the mobile device is located in an urban area. As such the sector selection component can change the threshold value that determines the sector to which to assign the mobile device based on the morphology of the area in which the mobile device is located.

Turning back to the memory can be a computer readable storage medium storing computer executable instructions and or information for performing the functions described herein with reference to the sector assignment system . Processor can perform one or more of the functions described herein with reference to the sector assignment system .

The data storage can be configured to store information transmitted to received by and or processed by the sector assignment system . For example with reference to the data storage can store measurement information for one or more mobile devices cell site location information sector information distance morphology information or the like.

As described above the measurement information can include geographical location information indicative of the location at which a mobile device is currently located or at which the mobile device was located at a time that the measurement information was obtained for the mobile device.

The cell site location information can include indicative of a geographical location of a cell site an associated BS one or more mobile devices currently assigned to the cell site or the like.

The sector information can include a sector number a corresponding frequency for the sector and or a number or identity of mobile devices assigned to the sector. For example in some embodiments the sector information can include an identifier of a first sector and an associated frequency of 1900 MHz. As another example the sector information can include an identifier of a second sector and an associated frequency of 850 MHz.

The distance morphology information can include morphology information for different types of geographical regions and corresponding threshold values for determining the sector to which to assign the mobile device. For example for a mobile device in a geographical region with a rural morphology the threshold value between a mobile device and a cell site can be a first value while the threshold value can be a second value for a mobile device in a region with an urban morphology. The value associated with the rural morphology can be greater than the value associated with the urban morphology.

The threshold values can also correspond to particular sectors. As such for each morphology a threshold value of distance between the mobile device and the cell site can be stored. Further one or more sectors can be associated with the distance. For example for cases in which the distance between the mobile device and the cell site is less than the threshold value of distance a first sector can be stored. For cases in which the distance between the mobile device and the cell site is greater than the threshold value of distance a second sector can be stored.

Accordingly the data storage can be accessed to determine a sector to which to assign a mobile device and or sector frequency information in various embodiments.

With reference to in various embodiments only one of the memory only one of the processor and or one or more of the data storage can be employed to perform the functions described herein. Duplicative components need not be employed in various embodiments.

Turning now to at method can include receiving information indicative of a handoff request for a mobile device. At method can include determining a sector of a cell site to which to assign the mobile device upon handoff. In some embodiments the determination is made based at least on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site.

Turning now to at method can include selecting a sector of a cell site to which to assign a mobile device. In various embodiments the selection can be based at least on a distance between the mobile device and the cell site at a first time.

At method can include re selecting a sector of the cell site to which to assign the mobile device. In various embodiments the re selection can be based at least on the distance between the mobile device and the cell site at a second time.

For example at a first time the distance between the mobile device and the cell site may be a first value that is greater than a threshold distance value thereby resulting in an assignment of the mobile device to a far sector of the cell site. At a second time after further travel towards the cell site the distance between the mobile device and the cell site may be a second value that is less than the first value . The second value may be less than a threshold distance value. As such the mobile device can be re assigned to the near sector of the cell site.

A number of program modules can be stored in the drives and RAM including an operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data . All or portions of the operating system applications modules and or data can also be cached in the RAM . The systems and methods described herein can be implemented utilizing various commercially available operating systems or combinations of operating systems.

A user can enter commands and information into the computer through one or more wired wireless input devices e.g. a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse . Other input devices not shown can include a microphone an infrared IR remote control a joystick a game pad a stylus pen touch screen or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through an input device interface that can be coupled to the system bus but can be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port an IEEE 1394 serial port a game port a universal serial bus USB port an IR interface etc.

A monitor or other type of display device can be also connected to the system bus via an interface such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor a computer typically includes other peripheral output devices not shown such as speakers printers etc.

The computer can operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and or wireless communications to one or more remote computers such as a remote computer s . The remote computer s can be a workstation a server computer a router a personal computer portable computer microprocessor based entertainment appliance a peer device or other common network node and typically includes many or all of the elements described relative to the computer although for purposes of brevity only a memory storage device is illustrated. The logical connections depicted include wired wireless connectivity to a local area network LAN and or larger networks e.g. a wide area network WAN . Such LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies and facilitate enterprise wide computer networks such as intranets all of which can connect to a global communications network e.g. the Internet.

When used in a LAN networking environment the computer can be connected to the local network through a wired and or wireless communication network interface or adapter . The adapter can facilitate wired or wireless communication to the LAN which can also include a wireless AP disposed thereon for communicating with the wireless adapter .

When used in a WAN networking environment the computer can include a modem or can be connected to a communications server on the WAN or has other means for establishing communications over the WAN such as by way of the Internet. The modem which can be internal or external and a wired or wireless device can be connected to the system bus via the input device interface . In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to the computer or portions thereof can be stored in the remote memory storage device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are example and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used.

The computer can be operable to communicate with any wireless devices or entities operatively disposed in wireless communication e.g. a printer scanner desktop and or portable computer portable data assistant communications satellite any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag e.g. a kiosk news stand restroom and telephone. This can include Wireless Fidelity Wi Fi and BLUETOOTH wireless technologies. Thus the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.

Wi Fi can allow connection to the Internet from a couch at home a bed in a hotel room or a conference room at work without wires. Wi Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices e.g. computers to send and receive data indoors and out anywhere within the range of a BS. Wi Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 a b g n etc. to provide secure reliable fast wireless connectivity. A Wi Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other to the Internet and to wired networks which can use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet . Wi Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands at an 11 Mbps 802.11a or 54 Mbps 802.11b data rate for example or with products that contain both bands dual band so the networks can provide real world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.

The embodiments described herein can employ artificial intelligence AI to facilitate automating one or more features described herein. The embodiments e.g. in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value benefit after addition to an existing communication network can employ various AI based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of the each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector x x x x x . . . xn to a confidence that the input belongs to a class that is f x confidence class . Such classification can employ a probabilistic and or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non triggering events. Intuitively this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include e.g. na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

As will be readily appreciated one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained e.g. via a generic training data as well as implicitly trained e.g. via observing UE behavior operator preferences historical information receiving extrinsic information . For example SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus the classifier s can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage etc.
