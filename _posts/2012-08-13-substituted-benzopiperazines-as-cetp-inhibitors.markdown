This invention relates to chemical compounds that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein CETP and are expected to have utility in raising HDL C lowering LDL C and in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences including coronary heart disease CHD stroke and peripheral vascular disease represent a truly enormous burden to the health care systems of the industrialized world. In the United States alone approximately 13 million patients have been diagnosed with CHD and greater than one half million deaths are attributed to CHD each year. Further this toll is expected to grow over the next quarter century as an epidemic in obesity and diabetes continues to grow.

It has long been recognized that in mammals variations in circulating lipoprotein profiles correlate with the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD. The clinical success of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors especially the statins in reducing coronary events is based on the reduction of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL C levels of which correlate directly with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. More recently epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL C levels and atherosclerosis leading to the conclusion that low serum HDL C levels are associated with an increased risk for CHD.

Metabolic control of lipoprotein levels is a complex and dynamic process involving many factors. One important metabolic control in man is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein CETP a plasma glycoprotein that catalyzes the movement of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the apoB containing lipoproteins especially VLDL see Hesler C. B. et. al. 1987 262 5 2275 2282 . Under physiological conditions the net reaction is a heteroexchange in which CETP carries triglyceride to HDL from the apoB lipoprotein and transports cholesterol ester from HDL to the apoB lipoprotein.

In humans CETP plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport the process whereby cholesterol is returned to the liver from peripheral tissues. Intriguingly many animals do not possess CETP including animals that have high HDL levels and are known to be resistant to coronary heart disease such as rodents see Guyard Dangremont V. et. al. 1998 14 vertebrate species. Relation to atherogenesis susceptibility Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 120 3 517 525 . Numerous epidemiologic studies correlating the effects of natural variation in CETP activity with respect to coronary heart disease risk have been performed including studies on a small number of known human null mutations see Hirano K. I. Yamashita S. and Matsuzawa Y. 2000 11 6 589 596 . These studies have clearly demonstrated an inverse correlation between plasma HDL C concentration and CETP activity see Inazu A. et. al. 2000 11 4 389 396 leading to the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of CETP lipid transfer activity may be beneficial to humans by increasing levels of HDL C while lowering LDL C.

Despite the significant therapeutic advance that statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin represent statins only achieve a risk reduction of approximately one third in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events. Currently few pharmacologic therapies are available that favorably raise circulating levels of HDL C. Certain statins and some fibrates offer modest HDL C gains. Niacin provides an effective therapy for raising HDL C but suffers from patient compliance issues due in part to side effects such as flushing. Drugs that inhibit CETP CETP inhibitors have been under development with the expectation that they will effectively raise HDL cholesterol levels and also reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients. Torcetrapib was the first drug that was tested in a long term outcomes clinical trial. The clinical trial of torcetrapib was terminated early due to a higher incidence of mortality in patients to whom torcetrapib and atorvastatin were administered concomitantly compared with patients who were treated with atorvastatin alone. The cause of the increased mortality is not completely understood but it is not believed to be associated with the CETP inhibiting effects of the drug.

Two other drug candidates dalcetrapib and anacetrapib are currently being tested in Phase III clinical trials including large scale outcomes trials. Data from the recently completed DEFINE Phase III trial of anacetrapib are promising. Patients who were being treated with anacetrapib along with baseline statin therapy showed an increase of HDL C of 138 and a decrease of LDL C of 40 compared with patients who were treated with just a statin. See 2010 363 2406 15. The data in the DEFINE trial were sufficient to indicate that an increase in mortality for patients treated with anacetrapib is unlikely. Additional drug candidates are still being sought that may have properties that are advantageous compared with the CETP inhibitors that have so far been studied or are currently being studied. Such properties may include for example higher potency reduced off target activity better pharmacodynamics higher bioavailability or a reduced food effect compared with many of the highly lipophilic compounds that have so far been studied. Food effect refers to the variability in exposure to the active drug that occurs depending on when the patient had last eaten whether or not the drug is administered with food and the fat content of the food.

Prodrugs which are compounds that are converted to the compound of Formula Ia Ie as they are being administered to a patient or after they have been administered to a patient are also compounds of this invention in the sense that they provide the claimed pharmaceutically active drug moiety to the patient.

The compounds disclosed herein including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are potent inhibitors of CETP. The compounds are therefore useful in treating mammalian patients preferably human patients having diseases and conditions that are treated by inhibition of CETP.

One aspect of the present invention provides a method for treating or reducing the risk of developing a disease or condition that may be treated or prevented by inhibition of CETP by administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of Formula Ia Ie to a patient in need of treatment. The patient is a human or mammal but is most often a human. A therapeutically effective amount is the amount of compound that is effective in obtaining a desired clinical outcome in the treatment of a specific disease.

Diseases or conditions that may be treated with the compounds of this invention or which the patient may have a reduced risk of developing as a result of being treated with the compounds of this invention include atherosclerosis peripheral vascular disease dyslipidemia hyperbetalipoproteinemia hypoalphalipoproteinemia hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia familial hypercholesterolemia cardiovascular disorders angina ischemia cardiac ischemia stroke myocardial infarction reperfusion injury angioplastic restenosis hypertension vascular complications of diabetes obesity endotoxemia and metabolic syndrome.

The compounds disclosed herein are expected to be effective in raising HDL C and or increasing the ratio of HDL C to LDL C. The compounds may also be effective in reducing LDL C and may be effective in treating dyslipidemia. These changes in HDL C and LDL C may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis reducing or reversing the development of atherosclerosis reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis or preventing atherosclerosis. The compounds disclosed herein thus may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis reducing or reversing the development of atherosclerosis reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis and preventing atherosclerosis.

Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal especially a human with an effective dose of the compound of the present invention. For example oral rectal topical parenteral ocular pulmonary nasal and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets troches dispersions suspensions solutions capsules creams ointments aerosols and the like. Preferably the compound of Formula Ia Ie is administered orally.

When treating the diseases for which the compound of Formula Ia Ie is indicated generally satisfactory results are expected when the compound of the present invention is administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 1000 milligram in one dose daily or divided into more than one dose per day.

Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets. Examples of doses in tablets include 0.1 mg 0.5 mg 1 mg 2 mg 5 mg 10 mg 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg 250 mg 500 mg and 1000 mg. Other oral forms can also have the same dosages e.g. capsules .

Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise the compound of Formula Ia Ie and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the compounds of Formula Ia Ie or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof if a prodrug is administered. A pharmaceutical composition may also consist essentially of the compound of Formula Ia Ie or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier without other therapeutic ingredients.

The compositions include compositions suitable for oral rectal topical parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous ocular ophthalmic pulmonary nasal or buccal inhalation or nasal administration although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.

In practical use the compound of Formula Ia Ie can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration e.g. oral or parenteral including intravenous . In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as for example suspensions elixirs and solutions or carriers such as starches sugars microcrystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as for example powders hard and soft capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.

Because of their ease of administration tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may of course be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compound can also be administered intranasally as for example liquid drops or spray.

The tablets pills capsules and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth acacia corn starch or gelatin excipients such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch potato starch alginic acid a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.

Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance tablets may be coated with shellac sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain in addition to the active ingredient sucrose as a sweetening agent methyl and propylparabens as preservatives a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.

The Compound of Formula Ia Ie may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of the compound can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.

The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol e.g. glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils.

The compounds of Formula Ia Ie including pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which the compounds of Formula Ia Ie are useful. Such other drugs may be administered by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor contemporaneously or sequentially with the compound of Formula Ia Ie. When the compound of Formula Ia Ie is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula Ia Ie is preferred. However the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula Ia Ie and one or more other drugs are administered concomitantly on the same or different schedules.

When oral formulations are used the drugs may be combined into a single combination tablet or other oral dosage form or the drugs may be packaged together as separate tablets or other oral dosage forms.

The combination therapies described above which use the compounds of this invention may also be useful in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. According to one widely used definition a patient having metabolic syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms 1 abdominal obesity 2 hypertriglyceridemia 3 low high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL 4 high blood pressure and 5 elevated fasting glucose which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the recently released Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults Adult Treatment Panel III or ATP III National Institutes of Health 2001 NIH Publication No. 01 3670. Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that are listed above including atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The combinations described above may ameliorate more than one symptom of metabolic syndrome concurrently e.g. two symptoms three symptoms four symptoms or all five of the symptoms .

First low density lipoprotein LDL Meridian was biotinylated by incubating LDL with biotin for 1 hour on ice after which it was dialyzed to remove free biotin. Then compounds at varying concentrations were incubated with 15 nM CETP reagent production group In Vitro Pharmacology MRL Rahway and 50 ug ml of the biotinylated LDL in 50 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4 for 1 hour at 37 C. The reaction was started by adding 3H cholesterol ester high density lipoprotein HDL American Radiochemicals Corp at a concentration of 0.6 nM. The reaction proceeded for 2 hours at 37 C. after which time it was quenched by the addition of 12 acetic acid. PVT streptavadin coated scintillation proximity beads which had been brought to room temperature were then added at a concentration of 4 mg ml. The assay was then mixed and counted after one half hour in a Microbeta plate reader.

Reagents and sources are 3H cholesteryl oleate GE TRK.886 3H Triolein Perkin Elmer NET 431 Butylated hydroxyl toluene Aldrich D4740 4 DOPC Sigma P6354 Sodium Bromide Fisher scientific S255 500 PEG 8000 Fisher BP233 1 and human HDL Intracel Corp RP 036 .

An in vitro assay for determining IC s to identify compounds that inhibit CETP transfer activity is performed based on a modification of a published method Morton and Zilversmit 1981 A plasma inhibitor of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer activities J. Biol. Chem. 256 23 11992 11995 . The ability of inhibitors to alter CETP activity is performed using two different assays one using recombinant CETP and one using an endogenous plasma source of CETP. Both assays measure the transfer of 3H cholesteryl oleate or 3H triolein from exogenous LDL to HDL.

Radiolabeled donor particles are generated by first combining 100 l of 200 M butylated hydroxyl toluene in CHCl 216 L of 21.57 mM DOPC in EtOH and either 500 Ci 3H triolein Perkin Elmer NET 431 or 500 Ci 3H cholesteryl oleate GE TRK886 in a glass tube. Reagents are mixed dried under nitrogen and then resuspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris 27 M EDTA at pH 7.4. After a brief vortex the solution is sonicated until clear and mixed with 20 mL of fresh human serum. The mixture is incubated overnight at 37 C. The 3H labeled LDL substrate is separated at 1.063 g ml density by sequential ultracentrifugal flotation in NaBr according to the method by Havel Eder et al. 1955 Chapman Goldstein et al. 1981 . Once isolated the particles are dialyzed 3 in CETP buffer 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 100 mM NaCl 1 mM EDTA . Human HDL is purchased from Intracel and used as the acceptor particles.

Transfer assays are performed in a 96 well v bottom polypropylene plate. For the RTA using recombinant CETP 2 RTA an assay cocktail is prepared with the final concentrations 128 g mL HDL 20 nM rCETP 2 human serum and 1 CETP buffer. 1 L of each test compound diluted in DMSO is added to 47 L of assay cocktail per well and incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour. To initiate the transfer reaction 2 L radiolabeled LDL is added. After an additional 60 min of incubation at 37 C. the transfer action is terminated by precipitation of LDL with an equal volume of 20 W V PEG 8000. The plates are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. A 40 L aliquot of the HDL containing supernatant is transferred to a Packard Optiplate with 200 L of MicroScint 20. After mixing plates are counted by liquid scintillation. Counts present in the supernatant for blanks wells containing only HDL acceptor CETP buffer and DMSO are subtracted from those containing test compounds and used to correct for non specific transfer.

For the transfer assay using endogenous CETP from serum 95 RTA the same procedure is used except that human serum is added such that a final concentration of serum of 95 of the total assay volume is achieved yielding a concentration of approximately 15 nM endogenous CETP in the assay. This is then combined with HDL and CETP buffer and the reaction proceeds as above and is terminated as described.

Comparison of the counts of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited DMSO only positive control yield a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation is used to calculate IC50.
