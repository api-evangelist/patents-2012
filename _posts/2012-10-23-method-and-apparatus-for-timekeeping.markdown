title: Method and apparatus for timekeeping
abstract: For reporting, recording, and/or employee timekeeping, an exemplary time manager interface on a display of a communications device allows an employee to track his or her work time and activities. The time manager interface connects the employee to a central time manager system that tracks and records employee check-in and check-out times. The time manager interface may also permit employees to view their and other schedules. The time manager interface is able to compensate for the time spent initially connecting to the network and launching the interface by recording the network logon time as the check-in time when the difference between the network logon time and the actual reported time is below a predetermined threshold.

Business establishments often use identification badges and time cards to track and manage employee time. Common timekeeping methods use personal computer PC terminals and time clocks that are interconnected via wired connections to track employee time. In order to track their time employees usually gain access to the PC terminal by entering an identification code and possibly a password or scanning their identification badge. The PC terminal communicates with the time clocks to obtain timing information and record the employee check in out time. However these clock based systems may be difficult to install are not always cost effective and are often non portable.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and or circuitry have been described at a relatively high level without detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Computer implemented methods and corresponding systems discussed by way of examples below utilize existing information technology resources of communications devices to monitor manage record and schedule employee work time e.g. in minutes hours etc. . Some examples described herein relate to methods computer implemented methods and corresponding systems that at a terminal positioned at a work site monitor the time of an employee of the work site with an interface that receives employee check in and check out times from an employee. A time difference between a time at which the communications device first gained network connectivity to a communications network and a time at which the employee initiated using the interface for recording employee check in time is determined and in the event the determined time difference is below a predetermined threshold the network connectivity time is recorded as employee check in time.

Some examples described herein relate to methods computer implemented methods and corresponding systems that at a mobile communications device positioned at a work site provide an employee of the work site with an interface for use in recording employee check in and check out times. The interface includes a field for activation by the employee. The identification information of the communications device is verified and in the event the identification information of the communications device is included in a list that contains identification information of authorized communications devices associated with the work site the employee check in and check out times are recorded in response to activation of the field by the employee.

In one example in the event the determined time difference is above the predetermined threshold the time at which the employee initiated using the interface for recording employee check in time may be recorded as employee check in time.

In one example the employee is provided with a field positioned within the interface and the employee check in and check out times is recorded in response to activation of the field by the employee.

In one example the geographical location of the communications device is determined and in the event the geographical location of the communications device is within geographical boundaries of the work site the employee is authorized to use the interface for recording check in and check out times. The GPS location of the communications device may be stored in a database for future audit.

In one example the identification information of the communications device is determined and in the event the identification information of the communications device is included in a list that contains identification information of authorized communications devices associated with the work site the employee is authorized to use the interface for recording check in and check out times. In some examples the list containing the identification information of authorized communications devices associated with the work site is maintained at a database remote from the communications device. The identification information may include at least one of an Internet Protocol IP address associated with the communications device a Mobile Device Number MDN associated with the communications device login ID password or Global Positioning GPS information of the communications device. In some examples the communications device is individually assigned to the employee. In such examples the employee is identified as a function of the identification information of the communications device.

As noted in some examples the employee is provided with a field positioned within the interface. The employee check in and check out times may be recorded in response to receiving identification information from the employee. The identification information may include at least one of a typable identification code assigned to the employee biometric information of the employee or a printed code assigned to the employee.

Although not shown in some examples the central time manager may serve multiple work sites of a work establishment e.g. various storefronts of a company that may be located in various geographical locations e.g. a company having storefronts across a city state country or even the world . For example the central time manager may serve work sites of multiple work establishments e.g. storefronts of multiple companies . Although shown as a single instance the central time manager may be implemented on multiple networked computer platforms in a distributed manner e.g. to provide redundant capacity in the event of network or platform failure and or to provide sufficient capacity for the central time manager functionality for a large workforce of a large enterprise type employer.

Although each establishment being monitored by the central time manager may have employees that are paid based on reported and or recorded work hours hereinafter referenced as non exempt employees and those who are salaried and are paid a predetermined salary regardless of the hours worked hereinafter referenced as exempt employees the term employee as used herein refers to those employees that are paid based on their reported and or recorded work hours non exempt employees .

As stated above the employee may use the communications device to track and record his her time into the time manager interface and indicate that he she intends to begin i.e. check in or end i.e. check out a work session at the work site of the work establishment not shown . The term work session as used herein refers to a period of time that the employee is working at the work site and should be reimbursed for the work performed.

The communications device may be a mobile e.g. wireless or non mobile e.g. desktop communications device . Examples of the communications devices that may be used with the systems and methods disclosed herein include but are not limited to personal computers desktop computers mobile phones Personal Digital Assistants tablet computers laptop computers etc.

The communications device may include a display for displaying screen content e.g. images . The display may be a built in integral display that is coupled wirelessly or through a physical connection e.g. network connection with the data processing components of the communications device . For example the display may be a touch screen display that detects the presence of pressure and location of a touch within the display area. The touch screen may respond to being touched with various objects such as fingers hands or a stylus.

In one example the communications device is coupled with one or more peripheral devices not shown that facilitate employee interaction with the computing device. The peripheral devices may be built in units or be coupled with the data processing components of the communications device wirelessly or through a physical connection e.g. a network connection . Examples of the peripheral devices include a mouse keypad and or printer.

In one example the communications device may include one or more audio I O devices e.g. microphone speaker etc. . In one example at least one of the audio I O devices may be a built in I O device. In one example at least one audio I O device is a separate unit that is coupled wirelessly or through a physical connection e.g. a network connection with the data processing components of the communications device . In one example the communications device may include video capabilities. The video capabilities of communications device may be provided by a built in video module or be provided by an independent video module that is coupled with the communications device wirelessly or using a physical connection e.g. network connection .

In one example the communications device is permanently mounted at a location in the work site such that it is accessible by the employees. In one example the communications device is positioned in the work site such that it is intended not to be removed from its designated location. In one example the communications device is installed at the work site upon establishment of the work site in order to prevent installation of other time management devices at the work site .

In one example the communications device is mobile. For example the communications device is a mobile communications device that can maintain connectivity and management functions while being moved within the physical boundaries of the work site and its authorized surroundings e.g. outside the worksite by personnel that serve as technicians that may travel from job site to job site . The mobile communications device may have limited connectivity ability e.g. WiFi only or may be able to connect via different networks e.g. WiFi and cellular . In one example global positioning GPS information is used to restrict the usage of the mobile communications device to the physical boundaries of the work site and its immediate surroundings. Alternately use of the software enabling the employee to check in and check out may be geographically restricted even though other functionality of the mobile communications device may not be restricted. For example GPS locations of the physical boundaries of the work site is determined by the communications device or by an external device and then sent to the communications device and the communications device is programmed such that it is used for tracking and recording employee time while within the boundaries indicated by the GPS information of the work site . The communications device in one example may be a device that is dedicated to time entry or to entry of work related activities for all employees and thus be enabled to run limited software such as that for time entry Office suite products etc. . . . .

As previously stated the employee may use the time manager interface appearing on the display of the communications device to indicate that he she intends to begin or end a work session. In response the time manager interface and the underlying time manager application software not shown may communicate with the central time manager . As noted previously the central time manager is responsible for monitoring tracking managing and recording employee work related activities and the times associated with these activities. The central time manager may be remote from the communications device for example at a server and be connected to the communications device via a communications network. Although not shown in one example the central time manager or parts thereof e.g. physical or implemented in software may be within the communications device .

Regardless of where the central time manager is positioned the employee may be uniquely recognized by the central time manager using employee identification information e.g. login ID password or employee ID entered into the time manager interface . For example the employee ID is a numerical alphanumerical or an alphabetical employee ID . The employee ID may be assigned by the establishment that operates the work site e.g. an employee number assigned to the employee or be a function of the previously known information about the employee e.g. based on the employee initials or a function of his her name date of birth or social security number . Regardless of its format the employee ID is a unique identifier that is used to uniquely identify the employee across all work sites and establishments monitored by the central time manager .

In one example each employee is assigned an employee ID that is unique across all work sites and establishments managed by the central time manager . For example each employee may be uniquely identified using his her social security number. Alternatively the employee ID assigned to an employee may only be unique within the employee s work site . In another example the employee ID may only be unique within predetermined work sites e.g. all work sites within a predetermined geographical range of the employee s usual work site e.g. same town or city or all work sites at which the employee is authorized to work by a superior. For example the central time manager may uniquely identify each employee as a function of the work site and or the establishment at which he she works. For example the central time manager may assign a unique identifier not shown to each work site and utilize a combination of the work site identifier and the employee ID to uniquely identify the employee . An employee may be assigned an employee ID of SAB and working at a work site to which identifier number 12 has been assigned may be uniquely identified by the central time manager as 12SAB. Each establishment operated by the central time manager may also be assigned an identifier.

In one example the central time manager may identify a work site as a function of the Internet Protocol IP addresses assigned to the communications devices utilized at that work site . Further in one example when utilizing a mobile communications device the mobile device number MDN of the communications device may serve as a communications device identifier. For example the central time manager may maintain a list of the IP addresses or mobile device numbers used by the communications devices located at each work site . This list of the utilized IP addresses may be maintained in a database included in the central time manager . When the employee utilizes the communications device to indicate to the central time manager that he she intends to begin or end a work session the central time manager detects the IP address of the communications device utilized by the employee . The detected IP address is verified against the list of utilized IP addresses at each work site and if a match is obtained the work site is identified and authenticated. Once the work site is identified and authenticated the employee may be uniquely identified as a function of his her employee ID and the identified work site .

In one example the employee may record his her work start and stop times e.g. check in and check out times using an individually assigned communications device . In this regard no further information may be required from the employee and he she may be uniquely identified upon identification of his her individually assigned communications device . It will be understood that some businesses track work from arrival at the start of the day e.g. punching in to departure at the end of the day e.g. punching out while other businesses track time in a more granular way based on time spent during the day on various tasks projects or assignments. The personal communications device may be used to capture the time in the more granular way as well. For example the different projects can be entered in the communications device .

In one example the employee ID information e.g. number is captured from a unique barcode or a quick response QR code that has been assigned to the employee . The barcode and or the QR code may be printed on an employee badge or stored digitally in a device e.g. the employee s mobile phone that may be able to display the code or barcode.

In other examples biometric information associated with the employee rather than an ID code is used. For example information such as employee voice facial features facial photo fingerprint handprint or iris characteristics may be used to uniquely identify the employee .

As explained above the employee ID regardless of the its format is entered into the time manager interface and used to uniquely identify the employee and track the date and or time at which he she starts or ends a work session.

The time manager interface provides the employee with a medium for entering his her employee ID . As noted in one example the time manager interface may be the user interface of an underlying time manager application software commonly referred to as an app not shown that is responsible for receiving the employee ID from the employee .

As shown in the time manager interface may include an employee ID field for receiving the employee ID from the employee . Depending on the employee ID format used the employee ID field may be configured to receive various forms of input. In examples which limit the employee ID to having a predetermined limited number of alphanumerical characters to avoid incorrect entries the employee ID field may be limited such that it may only receive the limited number of alphanumerical characters. For example the employee ID field is an activation button that is activated in response to receiving an input e.g. mouse click or touch from the employee .

The time manager interface may use various mediums for receiving the employee ID from the employee . For example when operating with an employee ID that is entered using a keypad the time manager interface may receive the employee ID information through a peripheral device such as a separate physical keypad not shown coupled with the communications device . In one example the employee ID need not be entered instead the ID is derived from prior login information e.g. login ID and password where the login ID may be different from the employee ID .

In one example the time manager interface may display a keypad for use in entering the employee ID . In one example the keypad may appear on the display in response to activation of the employee ID field by the employee . In one example the employee ID field is activated in response to a mouse click on the employee ID field or in response to touching of the employee ID field when using a touch activated implementation of the display . In one example the keypad may appear on the display upon launching the time manager interface . As noted previously in one example the time manager interface does not require a keypad and is arranged to only include an activation button. Although activation buttons may be used the employee ID field itself may be used by the employee to initiate his her check in or check out procedures by clicking in the field and or pressing in that field via touch screen .

The keypad may be presented to the employee in any manner known in the art. In one example the keypad may display limited characters. When the employee ID includes numerical characters to reduce possible errors in entering the employee ID e.g. inadvertent entry of alphabetical characters or symbols the keypad may be limited to including only numerical characters.

In examples that use employee IDs that include barcodes QR codes or biometric information the employee ID field is arranged to receive such information. For example the employee ID field may appear on the display of the communications device as an interactive field and the user is asked to align his her barcode QR code or biometric information source employee s iris or finger such that it is completely contained within the employee ID field . Once completely aligned the employee ID is read by the time manager interface by the appropriate input mechanism on the device such as a camera fingerprint scanner near field communication or NFC device etc. .

In one example the keypad includes shortcut keys for accessing other keypad screens that include characters not included in an originally displayed screen. For example as shown in the keypad may include keys for entering numerical characters e.g. 0 1 . . . 9 general keys e.g. shift backspace enter SYM etc. and shortcut keys for accessing alphabetical characters e.g. A B . . . Z and other characters and symbols e.g. etc. .

In one example the keypad is a touch sensitive keypad that responds to touch and pressure e.g. by fingers hands or a stylus . Additionally or alternatively the keypad may be used in combination with peripheral devices such as a keypad or a mouse which are coupled with the communications device .

As noted the time manager interface may use various mediums for receiving the employee ID from the employee . For example when using a tablet as a communications device a keypad may be used. For a mobile phone communications device a login ID password and employee ID may be used before further functionality is made available. For a personal computer PC communications device an clickable icon may be used to communicate the employee ID to the central time manager over the communications network . For example when operating with employee IDs that include QR codes barcodes or biometric information in addition or in place of the employee ID field the time manager interface may be coupled with a microphone not shown camera not shown scanner not shown or a barcode reader not shown that reads the barcode QR code or the biometric information.

In one example if a communications device is designated for use by some employee the time manager interface is arranged such that the employee no longer needs to enter his her employee ID into the time manager. For example the employee is able to record his her time by simply activating the employee ID field e.g. provided as an activation button and without having to enter his her employee ID .

The employee ID or related information once obtained by the time manager interface is forwarded via one or more communications links and through a communications network to the central time manager for monitoring and recordation. In one example information other than the employee ID may also be forwarded to the central time manager . For example information regarding the date and or time at which the employee has entered his her employee ID into the time manager interface is forwarded to the central time manager . Other instances of date and or time may be reported. For example the time at which the employee initiates the usage of the communications device is recorded e.g. by sending the time information to manager for recording . For example if it is detected that the communications device was not turned on prior to being accessed by the employee and or had to be booted up by the employee e.g. if the employee is the first person to enter his her time that day or if the system was turned off or had to be rebooted the time that the communications device was turned on or booted by the employee is forwarded to the central time manager . Additionally in one example the time at which the communications device first gained network connectivity is be reported. This time may be used instead of or in conjunction with the time indicated by the employee ID entered into the time manager interface to obtain a more proper estimate of the time the employee arrived left the enterprise.

In one example some thresholds are applied in time recordation. For example a time difference of up to thirty minutes may be allowed between the boot time or network access time and the actual time entry by the employee . For example when the user clicks on the employee ID field the network login time is determined from the PC. The login ID and the network login time are sent to the central time manager over communications network . If the current time e.g. time of the punch in is within a predetermined time e.g. 30 min of the network login time and if the punch in is the first punch in of the day the current time is recorded as the network login time. Otherwise the actual time of the punch in is recorded.

In one example a time difference between the time that the computer first gained network connectivity or was first booted and the time at which the employee initiated recording his her time may be determined. This calculation of the time difference may be done in a processor shown later in connection with of the communications device and in response to instructions included in the time manager application software. Once the time difference is determined it may be compared against a threshold e.g. thirty minutes . If below the threshold network or boot time may be recorded as the time the employee began a work session. If above the threshold actual employee check in time may be recorded as the time the employee began a work session. It will be understood that a subsequent user of the computer will not receive the benefit of the boot time unless the computer is indeed booted up again . The threshold may be set by an authority operating or overseeing the operation i.e. a person of the work site or a parameter set at a national level. In one example employee time is rounded up or down to the nearest minute.

In one example the date and or time information are determined based on the local time indicated by an internal clock of the communications device . In one example a network time protocol is used by the communications devices connected to the communications network to synchronize all connected communications devices. The date and time information as indicated by the synchronized computers of the network may be utilized for timekeeping purposes. In one example the date and time indicated by the base stations of a mobile network are utilized to track employee activities.

The communications device and the central time manager may communicate directly or through intermediary communications devices. For example as shown in the central time manager is implement as programming on a network connected computer configured as server in communication with the communications device via a communications network . A network or host computer platform typically may be used to implement a server with respect to client programming on user terminal devices although a server for one service may be client for another service. A computer or the like with user interface elements such as a personal computer or other type of work station or terminal device often is programmed with appropriate client software although for at least some purposes such a computer or the like also may act as a server. In the example the computer configured as the server is programmed to implement the central time manager and the computer or the like serving as the device is programmed to act as a client with respect to the server and its central time manager . The relevant client software may be part of or interact with the time manager application software by which the device provides the time manager interface . In one example the communications device and the central time manager may communicates through secure and or encrypted communications links. However in some instances the server and associated manager functions may be implemented on the same platform or device that implements the time manager interface .

The communications network may be a high bandwidth and or band limited communications network. In one example the communications network may be a wireless communications network. In one example the communications network is a local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN or a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. In one example the network may include one or more segments of one or more general purpose network e.g. Internet LAN etc. and or other networks e.g. Internet protocol IP network . Depending on the type of communications device used e.g. mobile or a network device the communications device and the central time manager may communicate through appropriate communications links e.g. wireless and or wired communications links and appropriate communication networks .

As explained previously the time manager interface may be an interface of the time manager application software not shown . In one example the time manager application software may implement the appropriate procedures for obtaining the employee ID and other information e.g. date and time and forwarding the obtained information to the central time manager on the server via the network .

In one example a security platform may host and or validate the time manager application software . In one example the security platform is an enterprise mobility platform that is responsible for building deploying managing and or updating the time manager application software simultaneously across various communications devices. In one example the enterprise mobility platform does not have any logic for time management. Instead it authenticates the employee logging into the system and forwards the check in request to the central time manager .

In one example the security platform maintains some information regarding the work sites that are being managed by the central time manager . Further in one example some information regarding the communications devices deployed at each of the managed work sites is maintained. As explained previously in one example the security platform maintains a list of authorized IP addresses that include the IP addresses and or the GPS information associated with all deployed communications devices .

In one example the information maintained by the security platform relating to the work sites and their associated communications devices is used by the security platform to identify the work site and or validate the communications device . For example the security platform may validate the communications device by checking its IP address against the list of authorized IP addresses to determine if the communications device is authorized to communicate with the central time manager .

In one example the security platform may determine the geographical location of the communications device and validate the communications device by verifying that the communications device is positioned within its intended physical boundaries. For example assuming that a mobile communications device is being used the security platform may determine the geographical location of the communications device . The security platform may utilize various mobile tracking schemes. For example the cell phone network may determine location information through multilateration of radio signals between radio towers of the network and the communications device to provide the geographical location of the communications device . In another example the communications device has a GPS receiver and the platform receives the latitude longitude coordinates determined by the GPS receiver or receives GPS signal measurements that the server uses to calculate the latitude longitude for the communications device . Once the geographical position of the communications device is obtained the security platform may determine whether the obtained geographical position of the communications device is included in the physical boundaries of the work site . Thus the platform is identifying the worksite from this location. If within the physical boundaries the communications device is validated and may be used for tracking and timekeeping of employee activities. In one example if the security platform determines that the communications device is outside of its intended boundaries an error message indicating the failure to validate the communications device is relayed to the employee through the time manager interface . The error message may also be stored and or transmitted to other personnel of the employer such as a supervisor of the employee for further review or action.

Further in one example the security platform may utilize its knowledge of the IP addresses of authorized computers at each work site to impose some restrictions on the communications device . For example when an employee tries to launch the time manager application software a request to launch the time manager application software including the IP address of the communications device is forwarded to the security platform . The security platform in response verifies the IP address of the communications device to determine if it is an authorized IP address. If so the security platform sends a response to the communications device indicating that access is granted and upon receiving the response the time manager interface is launched by the communications device . If not the security platform sends a response to the communications device indicating that access is not granted and upon receiving the response the time manager interface is unable to be launched. In one example notification is shown on the display as to the reason why the time manager interface is unable to be launched.

In one example in addition to verification of the communications device the employee ID is also be verified. The verification of the employee ID is done at the communications device and or using a module positioned within the communications network not shown or in the server . Regardless of the location where the employee verification is performed verification may be done by accessing a database that contains employee information and verifying the employee ID against the information in the database. The database may include employee ID and schedule for each employee who is authorized to work at a work site . In one example the database further includes information identifying the work sites at which each employee is authorized to report for work. In order to verify the employee ID the employee ID received from the employee may be checked against the database to determine if a match to the database exists. If a match exists the employee ID is verified as a valid employee ID . Otherwise if a match does not exist the employee ID is determined to be invalid. In such a case an error message may be relayed to the employee via the communications device and or the time manager interface indicating that the employee ID has been deemed invalid. In one example in addition to verifying the employee ID to ensure that it is included in the list of authorized employees the employee schedule not shown may also be evaluated to determine if the employee is authorized to begin and or end a work session at that time. Furthermore in one example the database of authorized work sites may be accessed to determine whether the employee is authorized to work at the work site where time recordation is being requested.

In one example the database including the information used for employee verification is maintained within the communications device . In one example this database is maintained within a component connected to the communications network . In one example the database is maintained by the central time manager i.e. database in server .

In one example the procedures for verifying the employee ID the employee schedule and or the appropriate work site to which the employee is assigned for work are implemented and carried out in the communications device . In one example the module that implements and carries out the required procedures is a component connected to the communications network i.e. security platform . Alternatively or additionally in one example the central time manager includes an access manager not shown that implements and or carries out the required procedures for verifying the employee ID employee schedule and or employee work site .

In one example the central time manager includes a service engine that interacts with the security platform to receive the information e.g. employee ID date and time information etc. forwarded by the communications device to the central time manager after successful completion of the applicable security procedure s . The service engine is a web service layer interacting with the central time manager for all the time entry information. Further in one example the service engine may utilize the database to uniquely associate the employee and the received information.

In one example the information received by the service engine is interpreted prior to being associated with the employee . In examples that utilize employee IDs that include a QR code or a barcode the service engine may include or be coupled with a module on the communications device that provides the appropriate functions for interpreting the barcode or the QR code. Similarly in examples that utilize biometric information a module not shown that provides the required functions for interpreting the biometric information and using the interpretations to uniquely identify the employee is utilized.

In one example the service engine may utilize the database to maintain previously obtained information for each employee and each work site . In examples that use biometric information to identify the employees the database may include biometric information e.g. fingerprint or voice sample that has been previously obtained from the employee . Upon receiving the information forwarded by the communications device e.g. upon receiving a recently obtained fingerprint or employee ID the service engine accesses the database to determine whether a corresponding previously stored value of the received information e.g. previously obtained fingerprint or employee ID that have been saved in the database matches the received information. If a match is obtained the employee is uniquely identified. If a match is not obtained an error message indicating the failure to uniquely associate the employee with the information in the database is relayed as above to the employee through the time manager interface .

In the event a match to the database is obtained the service engine records the date and or time information at which the employee is attempting to start or end a work session. In one example the data and or time information are stored in an area of the database designated for timekeeping. For example the particular worksite and or location is recorded e.g. when employees work at different employer customer sites . The worksite ID and or location information gets through to the central time manager through the communications network and recorded.

In one example the service engine may utilize the information received from the communications device to determine whether the employee is eligible for starting and or ending a work session. For example in one example the service engine may access a list of employees that are authorized to work at each work site . Additionally or alternatively the service engine may maintain work session schedules assigned to each employee at the work site . The list of authorized employees and or their assigned schedules are maintained in the database of the central time manager .

In one example upon receiving the employee ID and other relevant information e.g. employee ID and or login ID the service engine may verify the received information against a list of authorized employees and their assigned schedules to determine if the employee is authorized to start and or end a work session at the requested work site . The list of authorized employees and their assigned schedules may be maintained in the database . If authorized the central time manager signals the time manager interface that the employee has been verified and authorized. The time manager interface in response may issue an announcement to the employee confirming that he she has been verified and may start or end a work session. Alternatively or in addition a different device may be used for this notification i.e. the employee ID may be entered on a dedicated communications device at the work site and the notification provided on the communications device the employee s communication device e.g. mobile phone and or the communication device e.g. mobile phone of the employee supervisor. Notification may also be provided via email text message voicemail message or any other predetermined manner. Where a notification is provided to another device the information e.g. in the database about or associated with the employee that has just checked in or out via the interface on the device would identify and or include an address for each additional or alternative device that should receive notifications about the employee s activities and time records.

As noted above some establishments may classify or categorize the employees into categories including exempt employees i.e. salaried employees and non exempt employees e.g. hourly paid employees . In such examples the central time manager may maintain a listing of the classes or categories to which each employee belongs. The listing of the classes or categories may be maintained in the database . For example in the event the service engine determines that an exempt employee is trying to use the communications device to record the start and or end of a work session an error message is issued to inform the employee that he she is not authorized to use the central time manager for time and or date recordation. In one example the time manager interface in response to an appropriate message or command from the central time manager issues the error message to the employee using an audio message and or by displaying an error message on the display of the communications device . As in several of the other notification examples the central time manager may send a message or command to provide the notification to another communication device of the employee different from communications device .

In one example a confirmation is issued to the employee once the employee ID and other information such as the employee schedule are authenticated. The confirmation may be in form of a message that is relayed to the employee on the display of the communications device and or via a communication device of the employee if different from communications device . An audio announcement text message or video message providing the confirmation notification may be used to confirm that the employee has successfully recorded his her start or end of the work session. In one example the time manager interface may be responsible for relaying the confirmation message to the employee . For example the time manager interface may play an audio announcement e.g. including the employee name or employee ID or visually display an announcement e.g. including the employee name or employee ID on the display of the communications device to confirm that employee time has been successfully recorded.

In one example other employee identifiers such as employee name are included in the notification announcement or display. Further the recorded date and or time and or location may also be included in the confirmation presentation to the employee.

As stated previously in one example in the event the authentication of employee ID is not successfully completed the time manager interface indicates the failure to authenticate to the employee through an error message e.g. timeout entry completion network connection issues etc. . In one example the error message is included in an audio message. In one example the error message is included in a visual message that is displayed on the display of the communications device .

In one example the central time manager includes an application interface engine that is responsible for customizing the application software that is used with the examples described herein. The customization of the application software is done to increase the performance of the central time manager . For example the customization is performed at the application programming interface API .

In one example the employee uses the time manager interface for reasons other than tracking the beginning and end of a work session. For example the employee may utilize the time manager interface for viewing his her work schedule. Thus the time manager interface may provide the employee with a field menu or icon not shown for selecting an option for viewing work schedules. Once in the work schedule screen not shown in one example the employee may be allowed to select among various schedule viewing options. For example the employee is able to select between viewing his her schedule and or schedules of other employees if the employee has access to the other schedules as well as from various formats for viewing of the requested schedule s . Additionally or alternatively the time manager interface may provide the employee with a list of employees and request that the employee selects the employee whose schedule he she wishes to view. The list may contain information indicating whether the employee is permitted to view the schedule of another employee such as allowing the other employee s schedule to be selectable or providing a separate tag next to each employee s name indicating whether they are able to be viewed or merely not providing the identities of employees that the employee is not permitted to view. The time manager interface and the time manager application software may obtain the required information for displaying the employee schedule from the central time manager . For example the time manager application software may submit a request for the employee schedule to the service engine . In response to the request the service engine may access the database obtain the requested employee schedule and forward the obtained schedule via the communications network to the time manager interface . The time manager interface may subsequently display the schedule forwarded by the service engine .

Further the employee may use the time manager interface to view the number of hours he she has worked has been away within a given time frame e.g. over a day week or month or the date and time that he she has started or ended a work session. For example the time manager interface may provide the employee with a field menu or icon not shown that upon selection causes the interface to display the requested employee hours including if appropriate input of a desired time frame. The requested employee hours may be obtained by submitting a request for the hours to the service engine . The service engine in response accesses the database to obtain the time recorded for the employee within the requested time frame. This information is relayed back to the time manager application software and displayed by the time manager interface on the display of the communications device .

Furthermore in one example the time manager interface is used to create employee schedules. For example the time manager interface may display an image of available time slots that employees are scheduled to work. The available time slots may be displayed over various time frames. For example the available time slots for a day week and or a month are displayed. For example employees may insert their employee ID into time slots indicating that they are available for work during those time slots . This information is stored in the database . In one example the service engine creates schedules according to known load leveling methods based on these populated time slots. Thus employees may be selected for scheduling from a list of employees available to work at predetermined time slots. Regardless of the scheduling features provided the information required for scheduling the employees may be requested from the service engine . The service engine in response to receiving a request accesses the database to obtain the requested information. For example information regarding employee availability e.g. whether an employee works day or night or whether he she is on vacation may be obtained from the database. In one example once scheduling of an employee is completed his her newly created schedule is forwarded to the service engine . The service engine in response stores the newly created schedule in the database .

In one example the central time manager may utilize the recorded time and or date information to track employ performance. For example the central time manager may utilize the recorded to time to determine employee arrival time patterns etc. Such information may be sent to the employee managers at predetermined intervals or when one or more predetermined thresholds are met.

In one example the memory includes an operating system that implements various conventional operating system functions including memory management and controlled access to various devices such as a database storage and task and process scheduling. The data storage may include content such as images text video audio and computer applications.

In one example the processor is coupled to various interfaces via an input output I O device interface . The I O device interface may include logic to interface various input and or output devices such as a keypad or mouse with the processor and allow signals and or data to be transferred between the processor and the external input or output devices coupled to the respective interfaces . Further interface devices such as speaker microphone peripheral devices and display may be used to transfer signals and or data to from the processor and memory . In one example the I O interface includes a USB port not shown .

For example the communications device includes a network device interface that provides the communications device with access to a communications network . The network interface may be used to transmit and receive the messages and related data used for monitoring managing timekeeping and scheduling of employee work time. For example the network interface is used to transmit information regarding the employee ID date and time an employee begins a work session and receive a confirmation message including the date and time recorded for the employee .

As explained above if the employee is determined to be eligible to punch in e.g. non exempt employee network logon time and server time are compared . For example the time the communications device first logged on to the communications network and the time the employee initiated the punch in procedure are compared to obtain a time difference. The obtained time difference is compared against a predetermined threshold . If the time difference is below the threshold the network logon time is used to record employee time. If the time difference does not fall below the threshold the time as indicated by the communications device is used .

The central time manager is then consulted to determine if the employee has already punched in his her time. This may be done by determining if a punch in for the employee has been recently recorded. Some thresholds may be applied in determining what constitutes a recent punch in. For example if a multiple punch ins are detected in less than a minute it may be determined that a recent punch in exists. If it is determined that a recent punch in exists an error message is issued to notify the employee that the most recent punch in time has not been recorded since there are other existing punch in times recorded by the central time manager .

If a duplicate time is not detected employee time is recorded in the database of the central time manager . In one example a notification is issued to the employee to confirm that the employee punch in time has been recorded. In one example the date and time recorded for the punch in is also displayed in the confirmation message.

In one example the central time manager determines if the employee has a missing reported time. For example the central time manager informs the employee that he she has failed to report the beginning or the end of a work period and request that the employee contact a supervisor to manually record the missing time.

In the event network logon time is used in place of actual punch in time i.e. device time at the time of punch in the employee may be notified that network logon time has been used in place of actual punch in time.

As noted previously in examples in which an employee utilizes a communications device specifically designated for use by that employee to punch in his her time the employee may no longer need to enter his her employee ID . In such examples the employee is able to track his her time by simply activating the employee ID field . The central time manager recognizes the device e.g. based on its windows login ID that the employee used to login to the network as belonging to the employee and correctly identifies and records employee time.

As shown at check in time an employee reports for work . The employee turns on the communications device before he she can check in. Upon turning on the communications device the communications device logs onto the communications network and the logon time are recorded e.g. 9 00 AM logon time . After a not insubstantial amount of time e.g. say about 5 minutes the desktop of the communications device completes its boot up process . The desktop with all icons may therefore be ready for use at 9 05 AM . The employee subsequently launches the time manager interface resulting in the manager interface appearing on the display screen of the communications device . Once the interface is launched the employee activates an icon e.g. the employee ID field to be clicked for the punch in time. The process of launching and entering data into the time manager interface may take a minute or two. Since the employee is using an individually assigned communications device he she no longer needs to enter his her employee ID . Next the network login time 9 00 is compared to the actual punch in time 9 07 . If smaller than the preset threshold e.g. 30 minutes the network login time 9 00 is used as the punch in time . The employee after punching his her time commences work and the application auto exits after a preset period of time e.g. 5 seconds .

After some time for example at meal time the employee punches out to leave for a period of time designated as lunch time. Again the employee launches the time manager interface the punch time icon to be clicked e.g. employee ID field appears and is activated by the employee block . In one example the employee ID field may appear as a shortcut button signaling the employee to record his her time. For example the employee ID field may appear as a button having the text record your time included thereon. The check out time 12 14 PM is recorded . The employee after punching his her time leaves for lunch and the application auto exits after a predetermined amount of time e.g. 5 seconds . In one example the employee locks the communications device after punching out e.g. such that it cannot be used by others .

At the end of lunch time the employee returns to work unlocks the communications device block launches the time manager interface and the employee ID field appears and is activated by the employee block . The check in time 12 45 PM is recorded in the database of the central manager. The employee after punching his her time resumes work and the application auto exits after some time e.g. 5 seconds .

After another period of time at the end of the work day the employee punches out to leave for the day. Again the employee launches the time manager interface the employee filed appears block and is activated by the clicked punch time icon e.g. employee ID block . The check out time 6 03 PM is recorded and stored in the database of the central manager. The application auto exits after some time e.g. 5 seconds . The employee before leaving for the day logs off the communications device .

As stated previously an employee initiates a time punch by launching the time manager interface . For example the time manager interface is launched in response to the user selecting e.g. clicking or touching an icon for the time manager application software. In one example the icon is included on a desktop of the communications device shown in . The communications device is then locally authenticated to ensure that it is authorized to launch the time manager interface. In one example the procedures determine whether the communications device includes the appropriate license for running the time manager interface. For example a reference table that includes IP addresses of machines for an area is stored in a memory of the communications device. The IP address of the communications device is compared to the one stored in the memory of the communications device to identify the specific location of the communications device.

If the device is validated the punch time icon which may be the employee ID field is presented to the employee block . The employee may proceed to check in by activating the punch time icon e.g. employee ID field block . As noted before this may be done by activating e.g. by a mouse click or touching a shortcut button that signals the employee to record his her time by selecting the shortcut button. Once the punch time icon e.g. employee ID field is activated network logon time is recorded . In one example all logon time received from the communications devices of an establishment is recorded in one common time zone. The common time zone may be selected based on the location where the central time manager is located or based on the location where a central office of an establishment is located. In one example the logon time is reported in the native time zone where the communications device is located.

The communications device may further be authenticated by the central time manager . As noted previously the communications device may be authenticated in various manners for example by verifying its IP address or its GPS location . If the communications device is not validated the employee is not allowed to check in using the device .

If the device is authenticated the device information e.g. IP address or GPS location is used by the central time manager to obtain the employee ID . For example the central time manager determines if the network IP address of the communication device is authorized to provide punch time information. In one example the employee ID is obtained from a list including the employee IDs that each correspond to the communications device . In one example this list of corresponding employee IDs and communications devices is maintained in the database of the central time manager . If a corresponding employee ID for the communications device does not exist the procedures are terminated . In one example an error message appears on the communications device display indicating to the employee that an employee ID corresponding to the communications device was not found.

If an employee ID corresponding to the communications device is found the procedures determine whether the employee is an exempt employee block . As noted previously the central time manager may maintain a list of exempt non exempt or all employees and their corresponding employment status and compare the employee against one or more of these lists to determine if a match to a list is obtained. If the employee is an exempt employee as explained previously he she is not authorized to record time . In one example an error message appears on the communications device display indicating to the employee that as an exempt employee he she is not authorized to punch time.

If the employee is deemed non exempt the time indicated by the communications device at the time the employee ID field was activated is recorded . The difference between the time indicated by the device block and the time indicated at network logon block is then determined. The time difference is compared to a predetermined threshold e.g. 0 30 minutes . The time threshold may be set by the establishment or the specific work site to which the communications device belongs. If the time difference is within the threshold the network logon time is recorded as the punch time for the employee block . If the time difference is not within the threshold e.g. more than 30 minutes the device time recorded at block is recorded as the punch time for the employee block .

The procedures then determine if any other recent employee punches i.e. duplicate punches have been recorded . Some time thresholds may be imposed for determining a duplicate punch. For example in one example a time punch within the last 60 seconds may be deemed a duplicate punch. If the punch is deemed a duplicate punch the employee is notified for example using an error message appearing on the communications device display that he she is not permitted to punch time.

If the punch is not a duplicate punch the procedures determine whether network logon time was recorded for the employee punch time . If network logon time was reported a message may appear on the screen of the communications device indicating to the employee that the network logon time has been used to record his her punch time . If the device time has been recorded for the employee punch time a message may appear on the screen of the communications device indicating to the employee the time i.e. punch time that has been used to record his her punch time .

Although described in terms of visual messages in one example one or more of the messages e.g. error or confirmation messages announced to the employee are announced using audio messages.

In response to activation of the employee ID field the central time manager determines whether the work site including the communications device has been registered with the central time manager block . For example the security platform determines whether the work site allows its employees to record their time using the central time manager . In one example the security platform maintains a list of authorized work sites and verifies work site registration using the maintained list of work sites . If the work site is deemed unregistered the employee may be prompted to enter his her work site ID for use in further verification .

Once work site registration is verified the central time manager may determine whether the communications device is an authorized device. This may be done by verifying the IP address or other identifying information of the device against a maintained list of authorized devices. If the device is not authorized access is not granted .

If the device is authorized the time manager application software running on the communications device may be further verified to ensure that it is not in need of software upgrade . If an upgrade is needed the user may be prompted to upgrade the time manager application software block . If an upgrade is not needed punch time is recorded for the person who has activated the employee ID filed block .

In one example the central time manager further determines if the time manager application software is an authorized application block . For example the central time manager determines whether appropriate licenses for owning and or executing the time manager application software are in place.

If the time manager application software fails to be verified it is deemed unauthorized . In one example an error message is issued to the user announcing the failure to authenticate the time manager application software. If the time manager application software is verified the central time manager determines whether the employee is an exempt employee block . If the employee is an exempt employee he she does not qualify to record his her time using the central time manager block . In one example an error message is issued to the employee indicating his her ineligibility for using the central time manager .

If the employee is a non exempt employee his her time is recorded and announced to the employee in that employee s local time zone .

If the record your time option is selected the user may record his her time or view the time recorded for a some time period. If the view your schedule option is selected the user may be able to view his her schedule for a selected time period e.g. today s schedule . In one example if a schedule for a selected time period is not available the user is informed that the schedule is not available. If view other schedules are selected the user may be allowed to view create or modify other employee schedules or view create or modify a store schedule. The authorizations granted for management functions may be granted based on the information obtained from the system call . Further in one example a person having managerial functions is able to obtain a listing of work sites employees at each work site and or their schedules.

A server for example includes a data communication interface for packet data communication. The server also includes a central processing unit CPU in the form of one or more processors for executing program instructions. The server platform typically includes an internal communication bus program storage and data storage for various data files to be processed and or communicated by the server although the server often receives programming and data via network communications. The hardware elements operating systems and programming languages of such servers are conventional in nature. Of course the server functions may be implemented in a distributed fashion on a number of similar platforms to distribute the processing load.

For example aspects of the methods of employee timekeeping as outlined in the examples above may be embodied in programming for a server and programming for a communications device e.g. stationary or mobile . Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as products or articles of manufacture typically in the form of executable code and or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium.
