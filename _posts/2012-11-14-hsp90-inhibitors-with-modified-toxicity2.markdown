This invention was made with government support under grant number CA051210 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to geldanamycin derivatives having preferable toxicity profiles and their use in the treatment and prevention of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders in a mammal and pharmaceutical compositions containing these derivatives.

Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that utilizes the hydrolysis of ATP to assist in the folding of early nascent forms of proteins to their mature correctly folded forms. Once the protein has been correctly folded Hsp90 is released and thus it functions as a true protein catalyst. Hsp90 has also been recognized as an attractive anticancer target in that this chaperone assists in the folding of many oncogenic proteins including ErbB2 Raf 1 mutant p53 estrogen and steroid receptors. Thus by inhibiting Hsp90 a large number of downstream oncogenic proteins can be disrupted thereby attacking the neoplastic process at a number of points.

Neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinsons Disease PD Parkinsonian like syndromes such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy PSP Alzheimers Disease AD and poly Q disorders such as Huntington s disease are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 results in a compensatory increase in other protein chaperones which promote correct protein folding and thereby ameliorates diseases associated with accumulation of misfolded proteins.

The first Hsp90 inhibitor used clinically was geldanamycin. Geldanamycin is a benzoquinone ansamycin polyketide isolated from . Although originally discovered by screening microbial extracts for antibacterial and antiviral activity geldanamycin was later found to be cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and to be neuroprotective to cultured neurons.

While there has been a great deal of research interest in the benzoquinone ansamycins particularly geldanamycin and 17 AAG there remains a need for effective derivatives of these compounds having higher activity without the significant risk of toxicity of the parent geldanamycin compound.

The present invention provides novel geldanamycin derivatives quinone and hydroquinone ansamycins modified at the 19 position of the geldanamycin molecule and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that are potent Hsp90 binding agents with improved toxicity profiles relative to the parent quinones and hydroquinones. The 19 substituted benzoquinone and hydroquinone ansamycins of the present invention do not deplete glutathione and are therefore less hepatotoxic.

The present invention also provides methods of making and using these novel compounds as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.

Hsp90 has been developed as a potential anticancer target. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone which utilizes its ATPase activity to assist in the folding of early nascent forms of client proteins to their mature correctly folded forms. The basis for the use of Hsp90 as an anticancer target is that although it assists in the folding of many proteins a high proportion of these have been identified as oncogenic proteins which can drive neoplasia. Thus by targeting Hsp90 one can target a large number of downstream proteins and inhibit the neoplastic process at a number of points and such a combinatorial blockade of oncogenic targets gives rise to broad spectrum antitumor activity across multiple cancers. The first Hsp90 inhibitor used clinically was geldanamycin GA which did not move forward due to liver toxicity. The second generation BQAs 17 AAG and 17 DMAG are currently in Phase 1 2 clinical trials but their use is still limited by hepatotoxicity.

Hsp90 is a protein chaperone which assists in protein folding and paradoxically it s inhibition has attracted considerable attention as a means of protecting against misfolded proteins. Hsp90 inhibition leads to activation of Heat Shock Factor 1 Hsf 1 which is a master regulator of multiple heat shock proteins. Hsp90 and other co chaperones maintain Hsf 1 in the cytosol in an inactive form but when Hsp90 is inhibited Hsf 1 is released and migrates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of a network of Hsp s including Hsp70 40 and 27 which are particularly active in protein folding. The compensatory induction of Hsps to a high level results in an increased total chaperone capacity of the cell and protection against diseases caused by misfolded proteins. This compensatory induction of other Hsp s is employed as a biomarker along with decreased Hsp90 client protein levels in studies of the anticancer activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer patients.

The use of Hsp90 inhibitors as protective agents against neurodegenerative disease is a relatively new concept and the benzoquinone ansamycin BQA Hsp90 inhibitors have been used in a number of animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Geldanamycin 17 AAG or 17 DMAG induce multiple Hsp s and protect against protein aggregation and toxicity in cell or animal models of multiple neurodegenerative diseases thereby demonstrating significant blood brain barrier penetration and therapeutic potential. These include protection against the toxicity of mutant forms of Cu Zn SOD which occurs in about 20 of cases of familial ALS increased Hsp activity in the spinal cord and protection against neurodegeneration in mouse models of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA protection against htt aggregation and toxicity in a mouse model of Huntington s disease protection against poly Q disease induced neurodegeneration and Tau aggregation in models of Alzheimer s disease. This is an impressive list and specifically with respect to Parkinson s disease geldanamycin or 17 AAG have been shown to prevent synuclein aggregation and toxicity in a cellular model protect against synuclein toxicity in fly and yeast models and protect against MPTP induced dopaminergic toxicity in a mouse model of PD.

Despite their clinical use hepatotoxicity remains an issue with both 17 AAG and 17 DMAG. Hepatotoxicity was found to be a dose limiting toxicity of 17 AAG in two separate phase 1 trials and in the most recent phase II trial of 17 AAG in advanced unresectable breast cancer five patients developed grade 3 4 toxicities which were primarily hepatic and pulmonary. Based on these toxicity findings and lack of efficacy 17 AAG was not recommended for further study for this indication. 17 DMAG also demonstrated significant toxicities in phase 1 clinical trials including hepatotoxicity as reflected by liver function changes. BQAs have also been found to be relatively toxic in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease. In a mouse motor neuron primary culture model BQAs induced marked increases in Hsp levels and conferred dramatic protection against mutant SOD proteins but were found to be too toxic to cells. Similar toxic effects were observed using non quinone Hsp90 inhibitors radicicol or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate with induction of Hsp s only being observed at toxic concentrations. Newer Hsp90 inhibitors typically represented by non quinone resorcinol scaffolds have also been found to have their own characteristic toxicities in animal models which limit their use. Thus Hsp90 inhibitors represent an exciting opportunity for induction of Hsps in diseases characterized by protein misfolding but the therapeutic window of the known Hsp90 inhibitors is too narrow and less toxic agents are needed for clinical efficacy. This is particularly relevant if the Hsp90 inhibitors are employed as neuroprotective where any effective drugs may need to be administered for long periods.

Mechanisms underlying the toxicity of quinones are a function of their ability to redox cycle and or arylate cellular nucleophiles and the clinically used benzoquinone ansamycins are no exception. These molecules are capable of reaction with thiols at the 19 substituent leading to the formation of glutathione conjugates and adducts with cellular proteins. In our work we demonstrated that the parent BQA s GM 17 AAG and 17 DMAG all interacted with glutathione to form adducts which were characterized by LC MS. Once the protective capacity of cellular glutathione has been exceeded conjugation of quinone electrophiles proceeds with protein based thiols leading to loss of protein structure and function and eventually to cellular toxicity. Glutathione conjugation also leads to loss of the Hsp90 inhibitory capacity of the BQA since the glutathione adduct cannot be accommodated in the active site of the Hsp90 ATPase precluding inhibition.

To design less toxic BQA Hsp90 inhibitors the inventors proceeded to block the thiol conjugation by synthesizing 19 substituted derivatives 19 BQAs . The inventors have shown previously that the BQAs in general have relatively low rates of redox cycling and have now compared the relative rates of redox cycling of 19 BQAs with their parent quinones see Example 6 of this disclosure . No significant differences in redox cycling rates between all BQAs were found whether they were 19 substituted or unsubstituted. Similar data was obtained using NADH dependent redox cycling. Thus the fact that 19 substitution precludes arylation but does not alter the ability of BQAs to redox cycle and still prevents hepatotoxicity indicates that arylation reactions are predominantly responsible for the hepatotoxicity of BQAs. Thus the compounds of the invention especially the hydroquinone derivatives of 19BQAs remain potent inhibitors of Hsp90 induce a robust protective Hsp response in cells while showing greatly reduced and even minimal toxicity see Example 6 .

As described above the present inventors analyzed both mechanisms of Hsp90 inhibition and mechanisms of toxicity induced by BQA Hsp90 inhibitors and demonstrated that hydroquinone ansamycins rather than their parent BQAs were the active Hsp90 inhibitors. This important observation allowed the design of the compounds of the present invention which are more effective Hsp90 inhibitors that can be activated by the high levels of NQO1 present in human tumors.

As noted above and demonstrated in Example 7 of this disclosure the mechanism of inhibition of Hsp90 involves a trans cis conversion of the BQA. The 19 substituted forms of the BQAs of the present invention already exist in their cis form and are therefore in the correct conformation for Hsp90 inhibition.

19 Phenyl BQAs have markedly different growth inhibitory effects relative to 19 Me BQAs which allowed the use of 19 phenyl and 19 methyl BQAs as tools to probe the mechanisms of inhibition of Hsp90 critical for growth inhibition.

The inventors next addressed the issue of whether the hydroquinone ansamycin played any functional role in Hsp90 inhibition and growth inhibitory activity induced by BQAs and found that parent BQA s 

i inhibited purified Hsp90 much more readily in the presence of NQO1 to generate the hydroquinone and this could be blocked by the inhibitor ES936 

ii that isogenic NQO1 rich breast cancer cells MDA468 NQ16 formed elevated levels of the hydroquinone metabolites and exhibited much greater Hsp90 and growth inhibitory effects up to 66 fold depending on time of exposure relative to their isogenic NQO1 null MDA468 paired cell line 

iii that BQA induced hydroquinone generation Hsp90 and growth inhibitory effects could all be prevented by use of suicide inhibitors of NQO1 and 

iv molecular modeling of either benzoquinone or hydroquinone ansamycins in the active ATPase site of Hsp90 demonstrated a much more favorable binding energy for the hydroquinone form as the free OH groups of the hydroquinone forms were important to the efficient binding of the molecule and formed H bonds in the ATPase active site of Hsp90.

These data demonstrated that the hydroquinone ansamycins are more potent Hsp90 inhibitors than their parent quinones.

The BQA macrocycles are known to adopt an extended trans amide conformation in the solid state as evidenced by X ray crystal structure of geldanamycin. In contrast protein crystallography studies using either yeast or human Hsp90 have shown that on binding geldanamycin and 17 DMAG adopt a more closed C clamp conformation with a cis amide bond. 19 substituents on the geldanamycin quinone were designed to block attack by biological nucleophiles and hence ameliorate the hepatotoxicity seen with BQAs. However the inventors also hypothesized that the 19 substituent might also increase the preference for the adoption of the cis amide and consequently affect the Hsp90 binding affinity and potency of the inhibitors.

Given the limited applicability of literature methods particularly for the formation of a C C bond at the 19 position the inventors investigated a palladium catalyzed cross coupling strategy on readily available 19 iodogeldanamycin. After very considerable experimentation it was found that the Stille reaction was most reliable providing asnythetic route to the desired 19BQAs. NMR experiments using a range of techniques confirmed that the compounds had undergone the desired conformation change and were in the cis amide conformation in solution. X ray crystallography also showed that the 19 2 furyl derivative exhibited both the cis configured amide and also the C clamp conformation in contrast to GA itself that adopt a trans amide conformation in the crystal. Study of the binding of novel 19BQAs to the N terminal ATPase domain of Hsp90 showed that the compounds bind with the cis amide conformation. These data demonstrate that the 19BQAs start out in the cis amide conformation in both solution and solid states and end up protein bound as cis.

Studies conducted in cell lines see Example 7 demonstrated that compounds of the invention induce growth inhibition in cancer cells and the data indicate a role for NQO1 in the cytotoxicity of these compounds. Additionally the 19 substituted compounds induced more pronounced Raf 1 and AKT degradation and equal Hsp70 induction compared to the parent compounds lacking 19 substitution.

The inventors also examined the hepatotoxicity of the 19 substituted compounds of the invention compared with the corresponding parent compounds lacking 19 substituents and demonstrated that the 19 substitutions clearly prevented toxicity in hepatocytes.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the invention having a chiral center may exist in and may be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. It is to be understood that the compounds of the present invention encompasses any racemic optically active regioisomeric or stereoisomeric form or mixtures thereof which possess the therapeutically useful properties described herein. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms for example by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques by synthesis from optically active starting materials by chiral synthesis or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase . It is also to be understood that the scope of this invention encompasses not only the various isomers which may exist but also the various mixtures of isomers that may be formed. For example if a compound of the present invention contains one or more chiral centers the compound can be synthesized enantioselectively or a mixture of enantiomers and or diastereomers can be prepared and separated. The resolution of the compounds of the present invention their starting materials and or the intermediates may be carried out by known procedures e.g. as described in the four volume compendium Optical Resolution Procedures for Chemical Compounds Optical Resolution Information Center Manhattan College Riverdale N.Y. and in Enantiomers Racemates and Resolutions Jean Jacques Andre Collet and Samuel H. Wilen John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1981 which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference. Basically the resolution of the compounds is based on the differences in the physical properties of diastereomers by attachment either chemically or enzymatically of an enantiomerically pure moiety resulting in forms that are separable by fractional crystallization distillation or chromatography.

Because the benzoquinone ansamycins contain a quinone moiety bioreduction of these compounds to form semiquinone and hydroquinone species is a possible metabolic pathway in tumor cells in the presence of the appropriate bioreductive enzymes. The present inventors have previously demonstrated that the active forms of these benzoquinone ansamycins are the reduced forms the hydroquinone ansamycins Guo W. Reigan P. Siegel D. Zirrolli J. Gustafson D. Ross D. 17 17 117 90 . Cancer Res. 65 21 10006 15 2005 Guo W. Reigan P. Siegel D. Zirrolli J. Gustafson D. Ross D. 1 90 Mol. Pharmacol. 70 4 1194 1203 2006 .

NQO1 DT diaphorase EC 1.6.99.2 is a flavoenzyme capable of utilizing either NADH or NADPH as reducing cofactors to catalyze the direct two electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. Thus amongst the bioreductive enzymes expressed in cancer cells NQO1 is poised to have the greatest influence on the metabolism and activation of the benzoquinone ansamycins to hydroquinones. NQO1 is expressed at high levels in many human cancers including lung colon stomach pancreatic and breast cancers and has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of many quinone containing antitumor drugs such as AZQ mitomycin C EO9 streptonigrin RH 1 and lapachone by reduction of these compounds to the corresponding hydroquinone species.

As noted above the use of benzoquinone ansamycins has been limited by hepatotoxicity. Without intending to be bound by any one theory it is believed that the hepatotoxicity may be a result of depletion of hepatic glutathione. Benzoquinone ansamycins can form glutathione adducts on the 19 position of the molecule. The present inventors have isolated geldanamycin and 17 DMAG glutathione adducts after reaction of 17 AAG with reduced glutathione. A reduction or elimination of the hepatotoxicity associated with these benzoquinone ansamycins in either the quinone or hydroquinone forms is believed to result from diminished hepatic glutathione depletion.

The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below in the Examples section of this disclosure together with synthetic methods known in the art of organic chemistry or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods of synthesizing the 19 methyl substituted geldanamycin fall into two general categories. The first is a conjugate addition elimination strategy and the second is a palladium mediated cross coupling strategy. Both approaches start with the 19 bromo or 19 iodo geldanamycin. Details of these preferred synthesis methods are provided in Examples 4 6 and 7 of this disclosure.

The compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformation being effected. Also in the description of the synthetic methods described below it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions including choice of solvents reaction temperature duration of the experiment and workup procedures are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Such restrictions to the substituents which are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used.

The benzoquinone ansamycin starting compound is available commercially from Invivogen. Preparation of 18 21 dihydroxy geldanamycin derivatives is described in detail in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 218 320 U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006 0205705 A1 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

Therefore one embodiment of the present invention is a method of forming a 19 substituted benzoquinone ansamycin or a derivative thereof by treating a benzoquinone ansamycin or derivative as described in Examples 1 2 and 4 and shown in . Another embodiment is a method of forming a 19 substituted benzoquinone or dihydroquinone ansamycin or a derivative thereof by treating a benzoquinone ansamycin or derivative as described in Examples 1 2 and 4 and shown in .

Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which are media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals in particular mammals. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art to determine and accommodate. These include without limitation the type and nature of the active agent being formulated the subject to which the agent containing composition is to be administered the intended route of administration of the composition and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non aqueous liquid media as well as a variety of solid and semi solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons e.g. stabilization of the active agent well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1985.

The hydroquinone ansamycin derivatives of the present invention are relatively stable undergoing autoxidation to the corresponding quinone compound over time. This autoxidation occurs more rapidly in the presence of metal salts and particularly in the presence of copper. Therefore metal chelating agents can be used to prevent the autoxidation of the hydroquinone derivatives of the present invention. Thus one embodiment of the present invention is a method of reducing the autoxidation of a hydroquinone ansamycin derivative by storing the hydroquinone ansamycin derivative in the presence of a metal chelating agent. A related embodiment is a method of reducing the autoxidation of a hydroquinone ansamycin derivative by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a hydroquinone ansamycin derivative to a mammal in the presence of a metal chelating agent. A further embodiment of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing at least one of the ansamycin derivatives of the present invention and a metal chelating agent.

Unfortunately some metal chelating agents or sequestrating agents may interfere with the Hsp90 inhibitory activity of a hydroquinone ansamycin or may cause adverse effects of their own. Therefore preferred metal chelating agents and sequestrating agents of the present invention do not interfere with the activity of a hydroquinone ansamycin and do not produce toxic or other adverse events in an animal.

The metal chelating agent may be any compound that will bind metal ions without eliminating the activity of an ansamycin hydroquinone present in a composition containing the metal chelating agent. The addition of a protein metal chelating agent may minimize formulation problems encountered with hydroquinone drugs that result from formation of the corresponding quinone by autoxidation of the hydroquinone.

Exemplary metal chelating agents suitable for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention are proteins hereinafter referred to as protein metal chelating agents. Preferably these protein metal chelating agents contain the ACTUN protein motif. This protein motif was characterized by Harford et al Acc. Chem. Res 30 123 in 1997 and is characterized by a free amino terminus a histidine residue in 3rd position and two intervening peptide nitrogens. A particularly preferred protein metal chelating agent containing the ACTUN protein motif that is useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention is albumin and more preferably human albumin. Therefore a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a composition containing an ansamycin hydroquinone and a protein metal chelating agent having an ACTUN motif. A preferred embodiment is a composition containing an ansamycin hydroquinone and albumin and more preferably a composition containing an ansamycin hydroquinone and human albumin.

This invention further provides a method of treating a mammal afflicted with a cancer or proliferative disorder which includes administering to the mammal a pharmaceutical composition provided herein.

Another embodiment of the invention relates to the use of any of the compounds or compositions of the invention for use in the treatment of a cancer.

This invention also provides a method of treating a mammal afflicted with a neurodegenerative disorder or preventing the development of a neurodegenerative disorder which includes administering to the mammal a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such therapeutically effective amount is effective to ameliorate lessen inhibit or treat a neurodegenerative disorder. Therapeutically effective amounts can be administered according to any dosing regimen satisfactory to those of ordinary skill in the art. A related embodiment of the invention provides the use of any of the compounds or compositions of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disorder. Another embodiment of the invention relates to the use of any of the compounds or compositions of the invention for use in the treatment of a neurodegenerative disorder.

Administration is for example by various parenteral means. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration include various aqueous media such as aqueous dextrose and saline solutions glycol solutions are also useful carriers and preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient suitable stabilizing agents and if necessary buffering agents. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite sodium sulfite or ascorbic acid either alone or in combination are suitable stabilizing agents also used are citric acid and its salts and EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride methyl or propyl paraben and chlorobutanol.

Alternatively compositions can be administered orally in solid dosage forms such as capsules tablets and powders or in liquid forms such as elixirs syrups and or suspensions. Gelatin capsules can be used to contain the active ingredient and a suitable carrier such as but not limited to lactose starch magnesium stearate stearic acid or cellulose derivatives. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of time. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste or used to protect the active ingredients from the atmosphere or to allow selective disintegration of the tablet in the gastrointestinal tract.

A preferred formulation of the invention is a mono phasic pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral or oral administration for the prevention treatment or prophylaxis of a cancer consisting essentially of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like in the compositions. In addition prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monosterate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of a drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. The injectable materials can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter.

For preparing solid compositions such as tablets the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from for example 0.1 to about 500 mg of the therapeutic compounds of the present invention.

Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

The tablets and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention such as dragees capsules pills and granules may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using for example hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile other polymer matrices liposomes and or microspheres. They may be sterilized by for example filtration through a bacteria retaining filter. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient only or preferentially in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract optionally in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in microencapsulated form.

The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.

Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising for example cocoa butter polyethylene glycol a suppository wax or salicylate and which is solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of compounds of this invention include powders sprays ointments pastes creams lotions gels solutions patches drops and inhalants.

Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons such as butane and propane.

Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of compounds of the invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving dispersing or otherwise incorporating one or more compounds of the invention in a proper medium such as an elastomeric matrix material. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.

19 Bromo or 19 iodo geldanamycin analogues were readily synthesized from commercially available geldanamycin by electrophilic bromination with pyridium perbromide or with iodine as shown in .

Two synthetic approaches can be utilized for the synthesis of 19 methyl substituted geldanamycin derivatives a conjugate addition elimination strategy and a palladium mediated cross coupling strategy. Referring to both approaches start with the readily available 19 BrGA or 19 I GA.

The cross coupling strategy utilizes the Pd PPh reagent or alternative Pd catalysts in the presence of appropriate ligands and of CuX where X is a halogen and MeSn n BuSnPh or other stannanes.

Benzoquinone ansamycins BAs can interact with glutathione and these reactions have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Using a series of BAs the ability of BAs to undergo conjugation with glutathione was investigated. The BAs used were geldanamycin GM 17 allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17 AAG 17 demethoxy 17 2 dimethyl amino ethyl amino geldanamycin 17 DMAG 17 amino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17 AG and 17 demethoxy 17 2 pyrrolidin 1 yl ethyl amino geldanamycin.

The interaction of BAs including GM 17 DMAG 17 AAG 17 AG and 17AEP GA with glutathione was measured by HPLC and further confirmed by LC MS . Reaction conditions were 50 M BA and 5 mM GSH were incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 1 ml at room temperature in the absence and presence of 11.8 g of rhNQO1 and 500 M NADH. BA GSH conjugate formation was analyzed by HPLC at 270 nm and further confirmed by LC MS. The amount of BA glutathione conjugate formation was quantified using 3H glutathione. In reactions in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and room temperature using 5 mM reduced glutathione and 50 M BA approximately 45 M GMH2 SG conjugate was formed within 5 min which then slowly oxidized to GM SG A . This indicates formation via a classic 1 4 reductive Michael addition generating the hydroquinone conjugate intermediates which are then oxidized to quinone conjugates. Under the same conditions approximately 47 M 17 DMAG SG conjugate was formed within 4 h whereas 17 DMAGH2 SG was not detected A . This is likely because of the instability of 17 DMAGH2 SG conjugate and its rapid oxidation to 17 DMAG SG during analysis. The identity of glutathione adducts was confirmed by LC MS analysis D and D . Conversely the formation of 17 AAG SG and 17 AG SG was very slow under these conditions. Even after 24 h less than 15 of 17 AAG or 17 AG was conjugated with glutathione. Under the same conditions about 90 of 17AEP GA was conjugated with glutathione within 10 h. The relative rate of glutathione conjugate formation in this series of BAs was GM 17 DMAG 17AEP GA 17 AAG and 17 AG. BA glutathione conjugate formation was pH dependent and glutathione conjugates were not formed when the pH was 

These data demonstrate that GM the most hepatotoxic BA in the series had a greater propensity to react with thiols when compared with the least hepatotoxic analog 17 AAG. Therefore minimizing the propensity of BA derivatives to undergo glutathione conjugation while maximizing their two electron reduction to stable Hsp90 inhibitory hydroquinones which are properties of the 19 substituted geldanamycin derivatives of the present invention is a useful strategy for optimizing the therapeutic index of BAs.

Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 1600 series FT IR spectrometer using NaCl cells. Low and high resolution mass spectra were obtained for all novel compounds. Electrospray ionisation ESI and high resolution mass spectrometric HRMS analyses were measured on a Bruker MicroTOF spectrometer.

In vitro testing was performed to verify that 19 substitutions prevent GSH conjugation of benzoquinone ansamycins BQAs . Referring to reactions were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 50 M benzoquinone ansamycin in the absence solid bars and presence hatched bars of 5 mM GSH. At the indicated times GM series 15 min DMAG series 3 hr AAG series 16 hr the reactions were stopped and BQA concentrations were determined by HPLC. Results are the mean of three separate determinations standard deviations. p

The 19 substituted benzoquinone ansamycins were also tested in vitro for their ability to induce Hsp70 and Hsp27. Referring to Hsp70 and Hsp27 protein levels were measured in SH SY5Y cells by immunoblot analysis following treatment with BQAs for 16 hr. Panel A Hsp70 panel B Hsp27. Induction of Hsp levels is the proposed mechanism of protection against neurodegenerative diseases.

The 19 substituted benzoquinone ansamycins were also tested in vitro for their ability to reduce the toxicity of BQAs to SH SY5Y cells a dopaminergic model system of relevance to neurodegenerative disease. Referring to toxicity of BQAs in SH SY 5Y cells was measured using trypan blue exclusion panel A MTT growth inhibition assay panel B and annexin V PI staining for apoptosis panel C . Cells in A and C were treated with BQAs 5 M for 16 h cells in B were treated with BQAs for 4 h then allowed to grow in drug free medium for 72 h. Results are expressed as the mean SEM of 3 independent determinations. p

The 19 substituted benzoquinone ansamycins were also tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit growth similar to DMAG in human breast cancer cells . MDA468 NQ16 breast cancer cells were treated with 19 substituted DMAG analogs for 4 hours after which drug containing media was removed and cells were allowed to grow for an additional 72 h. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay. Results represent 3 independent determinations SD n 3.19 phenyl DMAG had greater potency at killing breast cancer cells than DMAG suggesting these compounds may be useful as anticancer agents.

The use of geldanamycin 17 AAG or 17 DMAG induce multiple Hsp s and protect against protein aggregation and toxicity in cell or animal models of multiple neurodegenerative diseases demonstrates significant blood brain barrier penetration and therapeutic potential. These include protection against the toxicity of mutant forms of Cu Zn SOD which occurs in about 20 of cases of familial ALS increased Hsp activity in the spinal cord and protection against neurodegeneration in mouse models of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA protection against htt aggregation and toxicity in a mouse model of Huntington s disease protection against poly Q disease induced neurodegeneration and Tau aggregation in models of Alzheimer s disease. With respect to Parkinson s disease geldanamycin or 17 AAG have been shown to prevent synuclein aggregation and toxicity in a cellular model protect against synuclein toxicity in fly and yeast models and protect against MPTP induced dopaminergic toxicity in a mouse model of PD. Despite their clinical use hepatotoxicity remains an issue with both 17 AAG and 17 DMAG. Thus Hsp90 inhibitors represent an exciting opportunity for induction of Hsps in diseases characterized by protein misfolding but their therapeutic window is too narrow and less toxic agents need to be developed. This is particularly relevant if the Hsp90 inhibitors are employed as neuroprotective agents where any effective drugs may need to be administered for long periods.

To design less toxic BQA Hsp90 inhibitors the inventors proceeded to block their ability to undergo thiol conjugation by synthesizing 19 substituted derivatives in the geldanamycin AAG and DMAG series. Substitutions at the 19 position R include methyl Me and phenyl Ph .

These 19 Methyl and phenyl BQA s were tested for their ability to react with thiols . Reactions were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 50 M benzoquinone ansamycin in the absence solid bars and presence hatched bars of 5 mM GSH. At the indicated times GA series 15 min DMAG series 3 hr AAG series 16 hr the reactions were stopped and BQA concentrations were determined by HPLC. Results are the mean of three separate determinations standard deviations p

The inventors next compared the relative rates of redox cycling of 19BQAs with their parent quinones by measuring altered rates of BQA induced redox cycling in purified hepatic mouse rat or human microsomes. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark electrode after addition of BQAs to NADPH supplemented liver microsomes. Reactions 3 ml were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.5 mM NADPH containing 0.2 mg of human microsomes at 37 C. Reactions were started by the addition of 50 M BQAs and oxygen consumption was measured over 5 min and no significant differences in redox cycling rates between all BQAs were found whether they were 19 substituted or unsubstituted. Similar data was obtained using NADH dependent redox cycling.

The inventors next tested the effect of 19 substitution of BQAs on hepatotoxicity in isolated hepatocyte systems. Isolated primary mouse hepatocytes were grown on coated 96 well plates and exposed to BQAs for 4 h after which their survival was determined using the MTT assay. The results expressed as the mean SD n 3 demonstrate that 19 substitution prevents toxicity in mouse hepatocytes.

Toxicity of the 19BQAs relative to their parent quinones was then examined using dopaminergic cell systems SHSY 5Y cells and their toxicity was markedly decreased relative to their parent quinones. Growth inhibition assays MTT were conducted in human SHSY 5Y cells following a 4 hr treatment with GA or 19Me GA. Cell were allowed to grow for 72 hrs following drug treatment. The 19 methyl substituted compounds in all series were minimally toxic see for data with geldanamycin MTT assay results are expressed as the mean SD n 3 . Importantly an ICfor the 19BQAs could not be calculated while parent quinones exhibited marked toxicity as shown in the following table 

Similar data were observed using trypan blue exclusion and apoptosis induction as additional indicators of toxicity.

To ensure 19BQAs were still capable of inhibiting Hsp90 the inventors examined their inhibitory capacity using purified recombinant Hsp90 and demonstrated that the 19BQAs inhibit the ATPase functionality of the Hsp90 chaperone particularly in the presence of NQO1 which generates the hydroquinone ansamycin. This confirms the inventor s previous findings on the superior potency of the hydroquinone ansamycins relative to their parent quinones with respect to inhibition of Hsp90. Biochemical data was also supported by molecular modeling of 19BQAs demonstrating that 19 substitution did not block entry of the molecule into the active site of human Hsp90 and that the hydroquinone derivatives of 19BQAs had more favorable binding energies in the active site of human Hsp90.

The inventors also demonstrated that these 19BQAs inhibit Hsp90 and induce a robust heat shock response in dopaminergic cells. Hsp70 and Hsp27 protein levels were measured in SH SY5Y cells by immunoblot analysis following treatment with BQAs for 16 hr. Importantly the desired pharmacological effect of Hsp induction can be observed with 19 BQAs at much lower doses in SHSY 5Y dopaminergic cells 0.25 0.5 M Panel A Hsp70 panel B Hsp27 than those that exert toxicity IC50 20 M . 19 phenyl and 19 methyl geldanamycin were of similar potency at inducing Hsp70 and Hsp27 as 17 AAG and geldanamycin. This data demonstrates that 19BQAs are potent inhibitors of Hsp90 and induce a robust protective Hsp response in dopaminergic cells.

In summary this data demonstrates that the 19 substituted BQAs tested do not react with glutathione at the 19 position redox cycle at similar rates to their parent BQAs but exhibit little toxicity in both hepatocyte and dopaminergic cellular systems in stark contrast to their parent quinones. 19BQAs retain Hsp90 inhibitory capacity in both purified enzyme systems and in cellular systems and induce a robust protective Hsp response in dopaminergic cells.

19 substituted benzoquinone ansamycins 19BQAs were rationally designed to minimize off target effects and hepatotoxicity. Our data demonstrates that the 19BQAs do not arylate cellular thiols validating the rationale for their synthesis. As demonstrated above the lack of arylation capability translates into a lack of toxicity of novel 19BQAs in freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes.

The inventors have developed isogenic breast and pancreatic cell lines and isogenic xenograft systems varying in the activities of NQO1 to define its role in the mechanism of action of 19BQAs. The inventors have also developed suicide inhibitors of NQO1 and demonstrated that these compounds are selective molecules with fewer off target effects than the competitive inhibitors used previously.

As shown above 19 Phenyl BQAs have markedly different growth inhibitory effects relative to 19 Me BQAs. The inventors have tested 19 Me BQAs in multiple cell systems and these molecules are non toxic despite being as effective Hsp90 ATPase inhibitors as their 19 phenyl analogs. This allows the use of 19 phenyl and 19 methyl BQAs as tools to probe the mechanisms of inhibition of Hsp90 critical for growth inhibition.

The Hsp90 catalytic cycle and the presentation of client proteins to Hsp90 is modulated by co chaperones including p23 Aha 1 and cdc37 and silencing of any of these co chaperones has been shown to potentiate response to 17 AAG. Cdc37 chaperones kinase clients critical for growth to Hsp90 including Akt Raf1 and cdk4 and because of the critical nature of these clients targeting the Hsp90 cdc37 interaction has become an attractive strategy. That all efficient Hsp90 ATPase inhibitors are not created equal and may modulate cell cycle growth differently depending on effects on individual co chaperones and downstream clients is consistent with the emerging biology on Hsp90 co chaperone function. Interrogating the effects of lead 19BQA Hsp90 inhibitors at the level of co chaperone Hsp90 interactions is supported by the following data demonstrating differential effects of 19 phenyl and 19 methyl BQAs on the cdc37 Hsp90 interaction.

As demonstrated in Example 6 the inventors have shown metabolism of geldanamycin 17 AAG 17 DMAG and other BQAs to their hydroquinone ansamycins using both purified NQO1 and in cellular systems. The inventors next addressed the issue of whether the hydroquinone ansamycin played any functional role in Hsp90 inhibition and growth inhibitory activity induced by BQAs.

The parent BQA s inhibited purified Hsp90 much more readily in the presence of NQO1 to generate the hydroquinone and this could be blocked by the inhibitor ES936. shows the inhibition of yeast Hsp90 ATPase activity by 17AAG hydroquinone 17AAG NADH NQO1 . This could be blocked by the NQO1 inhibitor ES936.

Isogenic NQO1 rich breast cancer cells MDA468 NQ16 formed elevated levels of the hydroquinone metabolites and exhibited much greater Hsp90 and growth inhibitory effects up to 66 fold depending on time of exposure relative to their isogenic NQO1 null MDA468 paired cell line. demonstrate a greater than 66 fold decrease in the ICof 17AAG is observed in MDA468 NQ16 cells compared to MDA468 cells. 17AAG treatment has a greater effect on markers of Hsp90 inhibition Hsp70 induction and Raf 1 degradation in MDA468 NQ16 cells compared to MDA468 cells.

The BQA induced hydroquinone generation Hsp90 and growth inhibitory effects could all be prevented by use of suicide inhibitors.

Molecular modeling of either benzoquinone or hydroquinone ansamycins in the active ATPase site of Hsp90 demonstrated a much more favorable binding energy for the hydroquinone form. The free OH groups of the hydroquinone were important to the efficient binding of the molecule and formed H bonds in the ATPase active site of Hsp90. These data demonstrate that the hydroquinone ansamycins are more potent Hsp90 inhibitors than their parent quinones.

Generation of NQO1 isogenic models in both breast and pancreatic systems was based on the identification of tumor cell lines carrying the homozygous NQO1 2 polymorphism characterized in the inventor s laboratory. Cells carrying this homozygous polymorphism are NQO1 null due to rapid proteasomal degradation of the NQO1 2 protein and include MDA 468 breast and Panc 1 pancreatic cancer cells. The inventors have stably transfected NQO1 into the MDA 468 and Panc 1 null backgrounds to generate isogenic pairs of cells which allows for definition of the role of NQO1 in physiological processes and tumor response. The inventors have also generated stable knockdowns of NQO1 in the NQO1 rich pancreatic cell line MIAPaCa 2. This work can be extended in vivo where MDA468 and NQ16 xenografts have been established to provide a tool for in vivo activity comparisons.

The BQA macrocycles are known to adopt an extended trans amide conformation in the solid state as evidenced by X ray crystal structure of geldanamycin. In contrast protein crystallography studies using either yeast or human Hsp90 have shown that on binding geldanamycin and 17 DMAG adopt a more closed C clamp conformation with a cis amide bond. 19 substituents on the geldanamycin quinone were designed to block attack by biological nucleophiles and hence ameliorate the hepatotoxicity seen with BQAs. However the inventors also hypothesized that the 19 substituent might also increase the preference for the adoption of the cis amide and consequently affect the Hsp90 binding affinity and potency of the inhibitors.

Given the limited applicability of literature methods particularly for the formation of a C C bond at the 19 position the inventors investigated a palladium catalyzed cross coupling strategy on readily available 19 iodogeldanamycin. After very considerable experimentation it was found that the Stille reaction was most reliable and use of 1.2 eq. stannane 20 mol triphenylarsine 5 mol Pd2 dba 3 and 5 mol CuI in DMF at 35 C. delivered the desired 19BQAs. Thus the 19 methyl phenyl vinyl 2 furyl and 2 thienyl geldanamycins were readily prepared. Subsequent reaction with allylamine or 2 diemethylaminoethylamine resulted in conversion into the corresponding 19 substituted 17 AAG and 17 DMAG derivatives. Because of the obvious concern about metal levels in pharmaceutical agents the inventors undertook a series of ICPMS trace element analyses and following purification the levels of As Pd and Sn were at insignificant levels 0.5 0.4 and 0.1 ppb respectively .

NMR experiments using a range of techniques confirmed that the compounds had undergone the desired conformation change and were in the cis amide conformation in solution. X ray crystallography also showed that the 19 2 furyl derivative exhibited both the cis configured amide and also the C clamp conformation in contrast to GA itself that adopt a trans amide conformation in the crystal. A study of the binding of novel 19BQAs to the N terminal ATPase domain of yeast Hsp90 showed that the compounds bind with the cis amide conformation. Hence all the data demonstrate that the 19BQAs start out in the cis amide conformation in both solution and solid states and end up protein bound as cis.

To confirm bioreduction by NQO1 19Ph GA was incubated with purified human NQO1 and analyzed by HPLC. The formation of a more water soluble product the hydroquinone ansamycin was observed which was completely inhibited by use of the NQO1 inhibitor ES936. Reactions with purified rhNQO1 panels A and B 19Ph GA 50 M was incubated with NADH 200 M in the absence and presence of purified rhNQO1 5 g . After 15 min reactions were stopped and analyzed by HPLC. Panel A chromatograph overlays of 19Ph GA NADH black and 19Ph GA NADH and NQO1 red . 19Ph GA black is reduced to the more polar 19Ph GA hydroquinone red by NQO1. Panel B chromatograph of 19Ph GA NADH NQO1 and ES936. No 19Ph GA hydroquinone formation is observed in the presence of the NQO1 inhibitor ES936.

The ability of 19 substituted BQAs to induce growth inhibition was measured by MTT in isogenic MDA468 null NQO1 and MDA468 NQ16 high NQO1 cells. Greater growth inhibition was seen in the NQO1 expressing MDA468 NQ16 cells compared to NQO1 null parental MDA468 cells implicating a role for NQO1 in the cytotoxicity of 19BQAs. Biomarkers of Hsp90 inhibition Raf 1 AKT degradation and Hsp70 induction were more pronounced in MDA468 NQ16 cells compared to MDA468 cells following treatment with 19 substituted DMAG analogs. These studies show that in MDA468 NQ16 cells 19 phenyl DMAG induced more pronounced Raf 1 and AKT degradation and equal Hsp70 induction compared to DMAG. 19 methyl DMAG induced an equivalent Hsp70 response to 19 phenyl DMAG in MDA468 NQ16 high NQO1 cells indicative of Hsp90 inhibition but had a much less pronounced effect on Hsp90 Raf1 and Akt.

The inventors extended the studies with 19 substituted DMAG analogs to include the Her2 human breast cancer cell line BT474 . Growth inhibition left panel was measured in BT474 cells following treatment with analogs for 4 hr. Growth inhibition MTT was performed 72 h following drug treatments. Biomarkers of Hsp90 inhibition Raf 1 AKT CDK4 and Her2 degradation as well as Hsp70 induction were measured by immunoblot analysis in human BT474 breast cancer cells following treatment with 19 substituted DMAG analogs 5 M for 24 hr left panel .

Results closely mirrored data obtained using MDA468 NQ16 cells and demonstrated that 19 phenyl DMAG induced growth inhibition while no growth inhibition could be observed with 19 methyl DMAG. In addition 19 methyl DMAG in contrast to 19 phenyl DMAG had diminished effects on Hsp90 client proteins Raf 1 AKT Her2 CDK4 while still inducing a robust Hsp70 response indicative of cellular Hsp90 inhibition. Similar effects on biomarkers of Hsp90 inhibition including pronounced Her 2 degradation were obtained using BT474 cells with 19 substituted geldanamycin analogs.

These results clearly demonstrate that phenyl substitutions on the 19 position of the BQA ring results in analogs with near equal potency to the parent BQA while methyl substitutions results in compounds with minimal growth inhibitory activity

The inventors also examined the ability of 19 BQAs to inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cell lines . For growth inhibition studies MTT cells were treated with drugs for 4 hr and then allowed to grow for 72 h. For biomarker studies MiaPaCa2 cells were treated with DMAG analogs 5 M for 24 hr. 19 BQAs inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cell lines and induce biomarkers of Hsp90 inhibition using isogenic Panc 1 NQO1 null and Panc 1 C5 NQO1 expressing cell lines. Consistent with data in breast cancer lines 19 Ph DMAG showed marked growth inhibitory activity and pronounced induction of biomarkers of Hsp90 inhibition while 19 Me DMAG had little effect and . Panc 1 C5 cells high NQO1 were more sensitive to 19Ph DMAG relative to parental NQO1 null Panc 1 cells . Growth inhibition was also assayed in MiaPaCa2 human pancreatic cancer cells treated with 19 substituted DMAG analogs and 19Ph DMAG was greater than 10 fold more potent than 19Me DMAG as shown in the following table 

As described above co chaperones modulate turnover of Hsp90 and also deliver specific clients to Hsp90. Cdc37 has been found to be particularly relevant since it delivers protein kinase clients critical to cell growth and cell cycle to Hsp90 including cdk4 Raf1 and Akt. Thus molecules that can target the ATPase functionality of Hsp90 in addition to affecting interactions with key co chaperones such as cdc37 represent novel Hsp90 inhibitors.

Forward and reverse immunoprecipitation studies were performed in BT474 cells treated with DMAG analogs 5 M for 24 hr. As shown in 19 phenyl and 19 methyl DMAG disrupted the interaction of p23 and Hsp90 as predicted from molecules that bind at the ATPase site of Hsp90.

Similarly the association of cdc37 with hsp90 was examined in BT474 cells and MDA468 NQ16 cells by immunoprecipitation following treated with analogs 5 M for 24 hr. As shown in BT474 cells and MDA468 NQ16 cells 19 Phenyl DMAG disrupted the interaction of cdc37 with Hsp90 while 19 methyl DMAG which is not growth inhibitory had little effect. This finding is consistent with X ray data using purified Hsp90 showing that the larger 19 phenyl substituent causes greater conformational change in the Hsp90 structure than smaller 19 substituents not shown . This also correlates with the differential effect of 19 phenyl and 19 methyl DMAG on clients chaperoned by cdc37 to Hsp90 which include Raf1 Akt cdc2 and cdk4 . Effects on these clients were marked with 19 phenyl DMAG while 19 methyl DMAG had little effect.

As described above a major obstacle in the development of BQA as drugs has been their ability to induce hepatotoxicity in preclinical studies. The inventors examined the hepatotoxicity of DMAG and 19 substituted DMAG analogs in primary mouse hepatocytes and results from these studies clearly demonstrate that 19 substitutions prevented toxicity in mouse hepatocytes . Treatment of primary mouse hepatocytes with 17 DMAG for 4 hr resulted in significant hepatotoxicity while no toxicity was observed with 19Ph or 19Me substituted DMAG. Toxicity was measured using MTT assay and confirmed using Trypan Blue and AST leakage. The data shown in were generated using MTT analysis but similar readouts were obtained using either trypan blue exclusion or leakage of AST from hepatocytes.
