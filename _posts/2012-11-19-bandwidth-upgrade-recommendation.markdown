This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 681 389 titled Bandwidth Upgrade Override filed on Nov. 19 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Access to a computer network system such as the Internet may be provided by Internet service providers ISPs to subscribers. Internet access may be provided to subscribers via different technologies e.g. cable television CATV integrated services digital network ISDN digital subscriber line DSL etc. at various data transfer rates according to various subscription tiers. A bandwidth amount or a data transfer rate associated with a subscription tier may be one determinant of subscription price such that a subscription tier with a higher amount of bandwidth or a higher data transfer rate may cost more than a subscription tier with a lesser amount of available bandwidth or a lower data transfer rate. For example a subscriber who tends to be a light user and uses his Internet service for less bandwidth intensive activities e.g. checking emails skimming news headlines etc. may choose a subscription tier with a lesser data transfer rate or bandwidth amount so as to not pay for capacity or speed that he may not be using. Alternatively a subscriber who tends to be a heavier user and uses his Internet service for more bandwidth intensive tasks e.g. online gaming video voice over Internet protocol VoIP etc. may choose a subscription tier with a higher data transfer rate or bandwidth amount so as to not experience latency.

In many situations a subscriber s bandwidth usage may elevate to a level higher than typical usage behavior. For example the subscriber may select to perform a bandwidth intensive task e.g. online gaming streaming content . If the bandwidth utilization exceeds a predetermined threshold a data transfer rate may be perceived as slow and may cause user frustration. Additionally some subscribers may be unaware of what activities may be bandwidth intensive. While the transfer speed offered with his current subscription tier may be adequate for the user s normal use a higher performance speed may be desirable for a higher quality experience for the bandwidth intensive task.

Embodiments of the present invention provide a recommendation notification to a subscriber to increase an amount of bandwidth available to the subscriber s network service account. Utilization of bandwidth may be monitored. When the utilization of bandwidth exceeds a predetermined threshold a subscriber s data transfer rate may be perceived as slow or incapable of handing the data being transferred. A recommendation may be provided to notify the subscriber of temporary bandwidth upgrade options. The recommendation may be in the form of a text message an email a pop up window a selectable user interface control or other notification method.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

Embodiments may provide for determining a minimum data transfer rate needed to effectively perform a data transfer activity. If the minimum data transfer rate needed to effectively perform the activity is greater than the amount of bandwidth available according to an associated subscription tier a notification may be provided to a subscriber that a bandwidth adjustment is available and may be desirable for a better quality experience of the data transfer activity. The notification may include a selectable functionality which when selected may send a request to adjust the amount of bandwidth available to the subscriber.

These embodiments may be combined other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures embodiments of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.

According to embodiments the system may include a bandwidth manager module operable to adjust an amount of bandwidth available to a subscriber network access connection. The available bandwidth may be adjusted via various methods that may alter an upper boundary of a data transfer rate for an access connection. An altering of the upper boundary of the data transfer rate may be an override sent to a gateway device . According to an embodiment the bandwidth manger module may be further operable to determine if a bandwidth increase may be advantageous for a data transfer activity and accordingly provide a notification to a subscriber of a recommendation to adjust the bandwidth associated with a subscription. The bandwidth increase may be a temporary adjustment for example an increased bandwidth for an allotted amount of time to perform a bandwidth intensive activity. The bandwidth manager module may be located at a service provider head end or may be located remotely and accessed by the head end via a network such as IP based network .

A subscriber may be charged a fee for a bandwidth increase. According to an embodiment a bandwidth increase fee may be calculated according to an amount of additional bandwidth and a time duration of the additional bandwidth. When a request to increase a data transfer rate is sent to a gateway device a notification of the bandwidth increase may be provided to a billing system associated with the service subscription such that a subscriber s account may be charged for the service upgrade.

According to one embodiment bandwidth adjustment may be provided for a selected time period. For example a subscriber may select to increase his bandwidth to a next available service tier for one hour two hours one day one week etc. Accordingly the billing system may receive a notification of the bandwidth increase for the selected time period and may apply a fee to an associated subscriber for the selected additional bandwidth amount and for the selected time period. According to another embodiment a subscriber s subscription may remain at an increased bandwidth tier until the subscriber selects to readjust or decrease his available bandwidth. Accordingly the subscriber may be charged an amount according to his subscription tier and may be charged an additional amount for the time period of the increased bandwidth. For example if a user selects to increase his bandwidth halfway through a billing cycle and does not readjust his bandwidth amount until the end of the billing cycle the subscriber may be billed at a first rate for the first half of the billing cycle and may be billed at a second higher rate for the second half of the billing cycle.

As described briefly above embodiments may provide for determining a minimum data transfer rate needed to effectively perform a data transfer activity and providing a notification to a subscriber if the minimum data transfer rate needed to effectively perform the activity exceeds the amount of bandwidth available according to an associated subscription tier. According to one embodiment data usage and bandwidth percentage may be calculated and monitored. Monitoring bandwidth usage may include determining an elevated level of bandwidth usage. For example if a subscriber has a subscription with 3 Mbps of bandwidth and has selected to upload 100 photographs to an online photo sharing website the percentage of bandwidth being used to perform the upload may be calculated. If a task e.g. the upload of photographs is consuming a predetermined percentage of bandwidth capacity e.g. exceeding a bandwidth utilization threshold a notification may be provided.

According to another embodiment a roundtrip method may be utilized to determine a potential need for additional bandwidth. For example if a time it takes a given network pack to travel form its source to its destination e.g. endpoint device or gateway device and back exceeds a predetermined threshold a notification may be provided.

According to another embodiment a subscriber s profile may be monitored for usage patterns. For example a subscriber s usage pattern may indicate that a large amount of bandwidth is utilized during the times of 5 00 PM to 9 00 PM. Accordingly upon detection of a peak bandwidth usage time a notification may be provided.

According to another embodiment data packet types may be inspected. For example data packets may be analyzed for certain types of data such as movies games etc. If a detection is made of a transfer of certain types of data packets that may be determined as bandwidth intensive a notification may be provided.

According to embodiments various types of notifications may be provided. For example a notification of a recommendation for a bandwidth increase may be provided as a text message an email message a pop up window or a selectable functionality control displayed in a user interface in an application window or on a web page.

Referring to an example of a notification is illustrated. According to the example illustrated in a subscriber may access a website for example a website offering movie downloads and may select content such as a movie to download. Bandwidth monitoring may be performed wherein a percentage of usage of available bandwidth associated with a communication path to a network access device or gateway device or a rate of data transfer may be calculated. According to one embodiment bandwidth monitoring may be performed by the bandwidth manager module . According to another embodiment bandwidth monitoring may be performed by an application on the network access device or gateway device . According to yet another embodiment bandwidth monitoring may be performed by a remote application and communicated to a gateway device a head end a bandwidth manager module or to a third party application for example a third party application associated with the website offering movie downloads. According to a determined available bandwidth amount and or a data transfer rate an estimated data transfer time may be calculated. A determination may be made to determine if additional bandwidth may be available to a subscriber such that the data transfer rate may be increased.

If a percentage utilization of available bandwidth exceeds a predetermined threshold if a percentage of data allowance is exceeded or if a rate of data transfer is below a predetermined threshold and if additional bandwidth or a higher data transfer rate is available as illustrated in a notification may be presented. The notification may be provided by the service provider head end or bandwidth manager module the gateway device or by a third party application. In this example the notification may be presented in the form of a pop up window and may include an estimated data transfer time . The notification may include an interface for allowing a subscriber to select and purchase additional bandwidth for an increased data transfer rate. For example the notification may provide one or more data transfer rate options . Each data transfer rate option may be associated with a service tier. A transfer rate selection data transfer rate option may include an estimated data transfer time . The notification may also include a selectable duration for the increased bandwidth adjustment. For example the subscriber may select a number of hours days weeks or for a permanent bandwidth increase. An associated fee may be provided as well as a selectable user interface element for completing the request for increased bandwidth.

Referring now to a notification in the form of a text message sent to a mobile communication device is illustrated. Like in the example described in bandwidth monitoring may be performed and a determination of availability of additional bandwidth may be made. As illustrated progress of a data transfer activity may be displayed for example via a progress bar and or as a percent completion of the data transfer activity. According to embodiments if a percentage utilization of available bandwidth exceeds a predetermined threshold or if a rate of data transfer is below a predetermined threshold and if additional bandwidth or a higher data transfer rate is available as illustrated in a notification in the form of a text message may be presented. For example the text message notification may be sent to a mobile communication device associated with a subscriber requesting the data transfer activity. The text message notification may include an estimated data transfer time and an option for requesting increased bandwidth. For example a reply to the text message may send a request to the bandwidth manager module to increase the subscriber s bandwidth amount.

As illustrated in a notification may be provided via a third party application. For example a subscriber may utilize a third party application e.g. online photo management application for storing photographs on a remote server. The third party application may communicate with the subscriber s service provider s head end and or bandwidth manager module to determine bandwidth usage capacity and availability. The third party application may also communicate with the subscriber s service provider s head end and or bandwidth manager module to provide various selectable bandwidth increase options and fees associated with the various options . The bandwidth increase options may or may not include selectable time durations of bandwidth increase. The notification may include a selectable user interface element for requesting a selected bandwidth increase option .

Having described a system architecture and various examples of bandwidth increase notifications is a flow chart of a method for providing a recommendation to increase bandwidth. The method starts at OPERATION and proceeds to OPERATION where bandwidth utilization may be monitored. According to one embodiment a subscriber s bandwidth usage levels may be monitored and tracked for example to generate a subscriber usage profile. According to another embodiment a time taken by a data packet to transverse a path from a source to its destination and back may be measured. According to another embodiment data packets may be inspected for types of data packets that may require more bandwidth than other types for example a transfer of video data packets.

At DECISION OPERATION a determination may be made to determine if additional bandwidth may be useful for performing a data transfer activity. For example a data transfer activity may include transmitting a digital bit stream of data e.g. web pages text images video audio applications compressed files etc. over a point to point or a multipoint communication channel. According to one embodiment if performing a data transfer activity causes a predetermined bandwidth utilization threshold to be exceeded a determination may be made that additional bandwidth may be useful for performing the data transfer activity. The bandwidth utilization threshold may be assessed according to a bandwidth amount allowed to a subscriber s account per his service tier and a percentage usage of the bandwidth amount for providing a minimal latency transfer rate of data. For example if a subscriber s usage of bandwidth elevates to a high level his Internet speed or data transfer rate may be perceived as slow or incapable of handling the data being read. According to another embodiment a determination may be made that additional bandwidth may be useful for performing a data transfer activity according to the data transfer activity or during a certain time period according to a subscriber s usage profile.

If a determination is made at DECISION OPERATION that additional bandwidth may be useful for performing a data transfer activity the method proceeds to DECISION OPERATION to determine if additional bandwidth capacity if available for utilization by the subscriber. For example if a service provider provides three tiers of broadband service wherein a first tier may provide a data transfer rate of 375 Kbps a second tier may provide a data transfer rate of 3.75 Mbps and a third tier may provide a data transfer rate of 12.5 Mbps and a subscriber is subscribed to the third tier with a data transfer rate of 12.5 Mbps additional bandwidth may not be available. However if a subscriber subscribes to the first service tier additional bandwidth may be available to increase his bandwidth capacity to the next available service tier e.g. data transfer rate of 3.75 Mbps . Additionally bandwidth may be shared with other subscribers. If a data transfer activity is occurring during a peak usage time additional bandwidth may not be available to allocate to a subscriber.

If additional bandwidth is available the method may proceed to OPERATION where a notification may be provided to the subscriber as a recommendation to upgrade his data transfer rate. As described above a notification may be provided in various forms and may include various service options e.g. available data transfer rates and or available upgrade durations and or a selectable user interface element for selecting to increase bandwidth. A billing system may be queried for a subscriber s contact information e.g. phone numbers email addresses etc. and his subscription information e.g. subscription tier . The method may end at OPERATION or may proceed to a method for receiving a request to increase a subscriber s bandwidth amount.
