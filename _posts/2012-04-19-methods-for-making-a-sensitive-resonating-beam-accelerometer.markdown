title: Methods for making a sensitive resonating beam accelerometer
abstract: A method of making a resonating beam accelerometer (RBA). In an example process, a proof mass device and resonators are created from a quartz material. A direct bond is formed between the proof mass and the resonators by applying a predefined amount of pressure at a predefined temperature for a predefined amount of time. One or more damping plates are created from a quartz material. A direct bond is formed between the damping plates and the proof mass device. The proof mass device is created by applying a predefined amount of pressure at pressure at temperature to two bases, two proof mass portions, and a flexure. The proof mass bases are on opposite sides of the flexure. The proof mass portions are on opposite sides of the flexure. A gap is present between the proof mass bases and the proof mass portions.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 751 157 filed on Mar. 31 2010 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 176 617 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under U.S. Government Contract No. FA9453 05 C 0241 awarded by Air Force Research Laboratories. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.

The sensitivity of an accelerometer can be degraded by creep of bonded joints. It can also be degraded by a difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion CTE between the bonding solder or glue and the bonded pieces.

The resonators and damping plates are typically attached employing either solder or glue. Glue and to a lesser degree solder may creep the tendency of a solid material to slowly move or deform under the influence of stress thus degrading the sensitivity of the accelerometer.

In addition the sensitivity of an accelerometer can be degraded by machining imperfections in the proof mass hinge. Machining the hinge can introduce microcracking in the hinge resulting in loss of accelerometer sensitivity and or hinge failure.

One way to manufacture a hinge is to glue or solder a thin blank between four proof mass sections. Once again creep of the solder or glue as well as the CTE mismatched between the solder or the glue and the proof mass material will degrade sensitivity.

The present invention provides a method of making a resonating beam accelerometer RBA . In an example process a proof mass device and resonators are created from a quartz material. A direct bond is formed between the proof mass and the resonators by applying a predefined amount of pressure at a predefined temperature for a predefined amount of time.

In one aspect of the invention one or more damping plates are created from a quartz material. A direct bond is formed between the damping plates and the proof mass device by applying a predefined amount of pressure at a predefined temperature for a predefined amount of time.

In another aspect of the invention the proof mass device is created by applying a predefined amount of pressure at a predefined temperature for a predefined amount of time to two proof mass bases two moveable proof mass portions and a flexure layer thereby forming a direct bond between the parts. The proof mass bases are located on opposing sides of the flexure layer at one end of the flexure layer. The moveable proof mass portions are located on opposing sides of the flexure layer at another end of the flexure layer. A gap is present between the proof mass bases and the moveable proof mass portions.

The present invention provides a sensitive resonating beam accelerometer RBA and a method for making a sensitive RBA. RBAs measure acceleration as a function of the frequency difference between two sets of vibrating quartz beams.

As shown in an exemplary RBA includes two sets of resonators a hinged proof mass and two damping plates . The damping plates damp out the oscillation of the proof mass . All the components are manufactured from the same type of material typically fused silica amorphous quartz or single crystal quartz.

The proof mass includes a thinned region that spans across two thicker portions . The thinned region acts as a bending point flexure for the end portions of the proof mass . The resonators are attached perpendicular to the hinge between each of the portions of the proof mass . The damping plates are attached to both the top and bottom sides of the stationary portion of the proof mass . When the RBA experiences an acceleration force the movable portion of the proof mass will bend and one set of the resonators will increase in frequency and the other set will decrease in frequency. The magnitude of the acceleration is determined by these frequency changes.

Prior to assembly of the RBA components the joining surfaces are polished. The parts are polished using standard mechanical glass polishing techniques. Then the surfaces are cleaned in a solution containing water hydrogen peroxide and ammonium hydroxide and then dried. The components are placed and held together at a predefined pressure of between 0.2 and 40 atmospheres with tooling not shown and heated to a temperature above 200 C. for several hours. Atoms from the components will interdiffuse and form a direct bond. This bond will not creep and if the joined parts are of the same material there will be no CTE mismatch between the bond and the joined pieces. Direct bonding allows for joining of two materials without an intermediate layer as in soldering or gluing. The direct bond of two similar single crystal materials results in the crystal lattices being joined together.

As shown in an RBA has been assembled using direct bonding. Damping plates and resonators are direct bonded to a proof mass according to the process described above. Direct bonds now exist between the parts.

As shown in an RBA is assembled by employing direct bonding using the proof mass shown in . Damping plates and resonators are direct bonded to the proof mass . The highlighted lines indicate where direct bonds occur.

An example process for performing a direct bond includes placing the resonators damping plates and proof mass into a tooling device that keeps all the parts in proper position. The tooling device also allows for pressure 10 50 lbs into be applied between the parts. Then temperature is raised over a two hour period to 450 held at 450 for eight hours then lowered to room temperature the last two hours. Only pressures and temperatures may be used in order to affect direct bonds to occur between like materials.

While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described as noted above many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of the preferred embodiment. Instead the invention should be determined entirely by reference to the claims that follow.
