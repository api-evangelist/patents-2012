title: Frequency domain interference cancellation and equalization for downlink cellular systems
abstract: Methods and apparatus are described for interference cancellation of interference components of a time domain signal in the frequency domain. A communications device receives a time domain sequence and generates overlapping time domain segments from the time domain sequence. The overlapping time domain segments are then converted to the frequency domain to generate frequency domain representations of the overlapping time domain segments. The frequency domain representations are stored in a residual memory, and interference components are directly removed from the frequency domain representations stored in the residual memory in the frequency domain.

It may be evident however that such aspect s may be practiced without these specific details.

The apparatus and methods described herein are configured to reduce the complexity and power consumption associated with interference cancellation by using an interference cancellation structure that performs signal equalization reconstruction and interference cancellation in the frequency domain. A signal is converted from the time domain to the frequency domain once and is subsequently kept in the frequency domain between successive processing iterations. Interference estimates are converted to the frequency domain and interference cancellation is performed in the frequency domain.

As shown at the signal transmitted by base station shown as S t may experience delays associated with the communications channel including for example multipath delays. Interference signal i shown at and transmitted by base station and interference signal i shown at and transmitted by base station are combined with the actual data signal waveform transmitted by base station . As such communications device receives a signal sequence r t shown at than includes in addition to the data signal waveform transmitted by base station one or more interference components.

For example as shown in a plurality of Fast Fourier Transforms FFTs may be performed to convert the time domain segments into frequency domain segments. While FFTs are shown in this example other frequency conversion operations may be performed. The frequency domain segments may be stored in frequency domain residual memory .

For a given segment all samples contributing to a portion of interest of that segment may be output to equalizer . The samples may be multiplied with an equalizer frequency response to compensate for interference due to the multipath channel and then converted back to the time domain.

The frequency domain samples may be multiplied with multiple sets of reconstruction filter frequency responses e.g. two sets as shown in which model the composite channel frequency response between a base station transmitter and a receiving device such as wireless communications device shown in . Interference canceller may then remove interference components associated with the given reconstructed waveform directly from the residual memory in the frequency domain. The process may be repeated for additional transmitter chains until all contributions of interference sources have been removed.
