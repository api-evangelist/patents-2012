This patent is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 11 857 724 filed Sep. 19 2007 entitled Methods and Apparatus to Test a Subscriber Line for a Broadband Access Service which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to broadband access services and or systems and more particularly to methods and apparatus to test a subscriber line for a broadband access service.

Communication systems using digital subscriber line DSL technologies and or passive optical network PON technologies are commonly utilized to provide Internet related services to subscribers such as for example homes and or businesses also referred to herein as users customers and or customer premises . PON technologies enable a service provider to efficiently provide a high data rate broadband Internet network broadband service and or broadband content via fiber optic cables. DSL technologies enable customers to utilize telephone lines e.g. ordinary twisted pair copper telephone lines used to provide Plain Old Telephone System POTS services to connect the customer to for example a high data rate broadband Internet network broadband service and or broadband content. For example a communication company and or service provider may utilize a plurality of modems e.g. a plurality of DSL modems implemented by a DSL Access Multiplexer DSLAM at a central office CO to provide DSL communication services to a plurality of modems located at respective customer premises. In general a CO DSL modem receives broadband service content from for example a backbone server and forms a digital downstream DSL signal to be transmitted to a customer premises DSL modem. Likewise the central office DSL modem receives an upstream DSL signal from the customer premises DSL modem and provides the data transported in the upstream DSL signal to the backbone server.

Methods and apparatus to test a subscriber line for a broadband access service are disclosed. A disclosed example network interface device NID includes a tone generator to transmit a tone on a subscriber line to characterize the subscriber line while a DSL modem is providing a DSL service via the subscriber line the tone having a frequency occurring within a range of frequencies in use by the DSL modem to provide the DSL service and a pair of terminals to couple the DSL modem and the tone generator to the subscriber line.

Another disclosed example network interface device NID includes a tone generator to generate a first optical signal the first optical signal selected to identify the NID and having a wavelength occurring within a range of wavelengths in use by an optical network unit ONU coupled to the NID and an optical coupler to combine the first optical signal with a second optical signal generated by the ONU.

A disclosed example loop tester includes a power meter to measure a power of a tone received on a subscriber line the tone having a frequency occurring within a range of frequencies in use by a digital subscriber line DSL modem to provide a DSL service via the subscriber line and a loop length estimator to estimate a length of the subscriber line based on the measured power.

A disclosed example method to identify a subscriber loop includes receiving a tone having a frequency occurring within a range of frequencies in use by a digital subscriber line DSL modem to provide a DSL service via the subscriber line the tone transmitted by a tone generator located at a network interface device NID wherein the tone generator is distinct from the DSL modem and demodulating the received tone to obtain a subscriber loop identifier.

In the interest of brevity and clarity throughout the following disclosure references will be made to connecting a digital subscriber line DSL modem and or a DSL communication service to a customer premises customer and or subscriber. However it will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that connecting a DSL modem to a customer premises customer and or subscriber involves for example connecting a first DSL modem operated by a communications company e.g. a central office CO DSL modem implemented by a DSL access multiplexer DSLAM to a second DSL modem located at for example a customer premises e.g. a home and or place of business owned leased and or operated by a customer via a twisted pair telephone line i.e. a subscriber line . The customer premises e.g. the second DSL modem may be further connected to other communication and or computing devices e.g. a personal computer a set top box etc. that the customer uses and or operates to access a service e.g. Internet access Internet protocol IP Television TV etc. via the CO DSL modem the customer premises DSL modem the subscriber line and the communications company.

Moreover while methods and apparatus to test a subscriber line for a DSL service and or a passive optical network PON service are described herein persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the example methods and apparatus may additionally or alternatively be used to test other wires and or cables for other communication services. Other example wires and or cables include but are not limited to those associated with public switched telephone network PSTN systems public land mobile network PLMN systems e.g. cellular wireless distribution systems wired or cable distribution systems coaxial cable distribution systems Ultra High Frequency UHF Very High Frequency VHF radio frequency systems satellite or other extra terrestrial systems cellular distribution systems power line broadcast systems fiber optic networks and or any combination and or hybrid of these devices systems and or networks.

In the illustrated example of the DSLAM provides the DSL service to the DSL modem at the customer premises via a subscriber line . Subscriber lines are sometimes also referred to in the industry as wire pairs and or loops. While throughout this disclosure reference is made to the example subscriber line of persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that a subscriber line e.g. the example subscriber line used to provide a DSL service to a customer premises location e.g. the location may include and or be constructed from one or more segments of twisted pair telephone wire e.g. a combination of a feeder one F1 cable a distribution cable a drop cable and or customer premises wiring terminals and or distributions points e.g. a serving area interface SAI a serving terminal a vault and or a pedestal . Such segments of twisted pair telephone wire may be spliced and or connected end to end and or may be connected at only one end thereby creating one or more bridged taps. Regardless of the number type s gauge s and or topology of twisted pair telephone wires used to construct the example subscriber line it will be referred to herein in the singular form but it will be understood that it may refer to one or more twisted pair telephone wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.

As commonly used in the industry the term network demarcation point denotes a location where cabling and or equipment associated with a service provider e.g. associated with the CO and or the DSLAM is physically electrically and or communicatively coupled to cabling and or equipment associated with a customer premises a subscriber a user and or a customer e.g. the example DSL modem . Such subscriber cabling and or equipment is often owned by the customer but may in some instances be owned leased and or otherwise provided by the service provider. Typically a network demarcation unit e.g. a network interface device NID is located at the network demarcation point e.g. on the outside of an exterior wall of the customer premises to implement the physical electrical and or communicative coupling between the subscriber and service provider sides of the network demarcation point. The example NID of contains a first set of screw terminals jacks and or jumpers to couple the subscriber line to the NID and contains a second set of screw terminals jacks and or jumpers to couple subscriber cabling to the NID . In such examples a jumper and or wire couples the two sets of cabling and across the NID .

In some examples to reduce and or eliminate the effects of telephone wiring not shown within the customer premises the example DSL modem is located and or implemented at and or within the NID . However the DSL modem need not be implemented at and or within the NID . For example the DSL modem could be implemented elsewhere within the customer premises . Alternatively the DSL modem may be partially implemented within the NID . For example a device e.g. a POTS splitter may be installed and or implemented within the NID to isolate the effects of telephone wiring and or telephones not shown located in the customer premises from the DSL modem .

To facilitate testing of the example subscriber line the example NID of includes a tone generator . The example tone generator TG of generates and transmits one or more signals e.g. tones on the subscriber line . The example tone generator transmits the signals while the DSL modem is operating to provide a DSL service. An example manner of implementing any or all of the example tone generators of and or is described below in connection with .

As illustrated in signal s and generated by the example tone generator of may have frequencies that occur within a range of frequencies used e.g. transmitted and or received by the example DSL modem to provide a DSL service at the customer premises . The example tone generator transmits the signal s at power e.g. signal levels that provide for adequate and or sufficiently accurate testing of the subscriber loop while reducing the impact on DSL services. For example as illustrated in the tone s generated by the example tone generator are transmitted with a signal power level of 60 dBm Hz whereas the DSL signals are transmitted with a nominal signal power level of 40 dBm Hz thereby causing only 1 or 2 DSL sub carriers e.g. a modulated 4.3125 thousand cycles per second kHz carrier of a DSL signal in accordance with the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunications Union ITU T G.dmt standard to be disrupted by each of the example tone s .

In some examples the signal s transmitted by the example tone generator of are encoded and or modulated to facilitate identification of the tone generator the NID the subscriber loop the customer premises and or a subscriber associated with the customer premises . For example as illustrated in the signal s e.g. tone s may be amplitude modulated where the amplitude s of the signal s during different time periods depend upon an identifier associated with a particular tone generator a particular NID a particular subscriber loop a particular customer premises and or a particular subscriber. In the illustrated example of an identifier comprising a bit sequence 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 is being transmitted. During a first time period corresponding to the first bit of the sequence having a value of one 1 the signal is transmitted with an amplitude of one. During a second time period corresponding to the second bit of the sequence having a value of zero 0 the signal is transmitted with an amplitude of zero e.g. nothing is transmitted . Additionally or alternatively the signal s may be modulated using phase modulation and or code division multiple access CDMA modulation.

Turning to signals generated and or transmitted by the example tone generator of may be coupled to the subscriber line via a coupling circuit and or device such as a balun . The example balun of is a passive circuit and or component that matches impedances between two signals and or converts the unbalanced output e.g. a signal transported on a single conductor and a ground of the tone generator into a balanced signal e.g. a signal transported on two conductors and or wires with equal currents flowing in opposite directions that may be coupled to the pair of terminals without causing appreciable effects to existing and or ongoing DSL and or telephone services. An example balun is Model No. 0707LB from North Hills Signal Processing which converts between a 50 ohm impedance unbalanced signal and a 600 impedance balanced signal suitable for coupling onto a twisted pair telephone line. Additionally or alternatively the signals generated and or transmitted by the tone generator may be coupled directly to the pair of terminals without use of an intervening coupling circuit and or device. The example tone generator and or the example balun may be implemented included and or operated at the NID even when no customer wiring and or customer premises devices e.g. the DSL modem and or a telephone are coupled to the NID .

Returning to to test the example subscriber line using signals transmitted by the example tone generator the example DSL communication system of includes one or more loop testers two of which are designated at reference numerals and . The example loop testers and of may be battery operated portable and or handheld devices useable by a technician installer and or service person to test the subscriber line and may be used a outside and or within the customer premises b outside and or within the CO and or c anywhere along the subscriber loop e.g. at a wiring cabinet and or wiring pedestal . Additionally or alternatively the example loop testers and or of may be a substantially fixed location devices implemented within the CO e.g. implemented within a rack of equipment and operable and or configurable to test the subscriber loop and or any number of additional or alternative subscriber loops not shown . In such instances the example loop tester may be coupled to the subscriber loop via a switch e.g. a switch manufactured by Spirent Communications which is configurable to connect at any particular time any one of a plurality of subscriber loops e.g. the example subscriber loop to the example loop tester . An example manner of implementing any or all of the example loop testers and of is described below in connection with .

The example loop testers and of measure the power at which signals transmitted by the example tone generator are received at the loop tester . For example the loop tester s and or may measure the attenuation of one or more of the tones transmitted by the tone generator . The example loop tester s and or then uses the measured attenuation s to estimate the loop loss of the subscriber loop and or to estimate the length of the subscriber loop . For example using a database e.g. table that associates for a particular frequency signal attenuation values with loop lengths the loop tester s and or can determine e.g. estimate a length of the subscriber line . If more than one signal attenuation value e.g. at more than one of the example frequencies of is measured the loop testers and can estimate a loop length based on each of the signal attenuations and then average the estimated loop lengths to obtain a single estimated loop length. Other methods and apparatus to estimate loop lengths given one or more signal attenuation values are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 751 353 filed on May 21 2007 and entitled Methods and Apparatus to Characterize a Digital Subscriber Line DSL Subscriber Loop. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 751 353 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

To store data and or information associated with subscriber lines the example DSL communication system of includes a loop database . The example loop database of stores a plurality of database records for respective ones of a plurality of subscriber lines e.g. the example subscriber line . Example information that may be stored in a database record includes but is not limited to an estimated loop length DSL connection rate error rates signal attenuation signal to noise ratios bit allocations DSL modem configuration etc. When the example loop tester s and or of estimate a loop length for a subscriber line they may update the corresponding database record in the loop database . Such updates may occur when the estimation is performed and or may be stored by and or within the loop tester and then used to update the loop database at a later time. Although this disclosure references multiple loop testers and the measurements and or estimations discussed herein may be accomplished with one or more loop testers.

To facilitate testing of the example PON subscriber line and or to facilitate identification of the NID the example ONU a subscriber and or a customer premises the example NID of includes the example tone generator an electrical to optical converter and an optical coupler . The example tone generator of generates and transmits one or more optical signals e.g. tones on the PON subscriber line . The example tone generator transmits the signals while the ONU is operating. As described above in connection with the example tone generator transmits optical signals falling within a range of optical wavelengths in use by the example ONU . Moreover as described above in connection with the optical signal s transmitted by the example tone generator may be modulated e.g. amplitude modulated phase modulated CDMA modulated and or otherwise to convey one or more identifiers associated with the example NID the example ONU a subscriber and or a customer premises. An example manner of implementing the example tone generator of is described below in connection with .

To modulate signals the example tone generator of includes a modulator and an identifier . Using any modulation technique e.g. amplitude phase CDMA and or otherwise circuit s logic devices and or algorithm s the example modulator modulates one or more of the tones generated by the example signal generator . An example modulation that may be implemented by the example modulator is described above in connection with .

While an example manner of implementing any or all of the example tone generators and or of and or has been illustrated in one or more of the elements processes and or devices illustrated in may be combined divided re arranged omitted eliminated and or implemented in any other way. Further the example signal generator the example modulator and or more generally the example tone generator of may be implemented by hardware software firmware and or any combination of hardware software and or firmware. Further still the example tone generator of may include one or more elements processes and or devices in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated elements processes and devices.

To allow a person to operate the example loop tester of the loop tester of includes any number and or type s of interfaces .

Example interface s include but are not limited to any number of button s key s keypad s screen s display s light emitting diode s etc. Additionally or alternatively the example interface of may be implemented and or provided by an operating system executed by the example controller . For example if a loop tester is implemented by within and or in conjunction with a portable computing device e.g. a laptop and or personal digital assistant the interfaces may be implemented by the portable computing device and or an operating system executing on the controller . If a loop tester is implemented within for example a rack of equipment the example interface s may be an application programming interface API via which the loop tester can be controlled by other equipment. The example interface s may additionally or alternatively be used to for example control the example switch of to select a specific subscriber line to be coupled to the loop tester .

To couple a received signal to the example loop tester of the example loop tester includes a coupling circuit . Example coupling circuits include but are not limited to a balun an antenna and or an optical to electrical converter. A balun may be used to electrically couple a twisted wire pair subscriber line to the loop tester . An antenna may be used to couple radio waves emitted by a subscriber line to the loop tester . For example the loop tester may not be electrically or optically connected to a given subscriber line but instead may need only be near to a subscriber line to be tested and or identified. An optical to electrical converter may be used to convert an optical signal on a PON to an electrical signal and to couple the electrical signal to the loop tester .

To measure received signal power the example loop tester of includes a power meter . Using any number of circuit s device s logic algorithm s and or method s the example power meter measures the received signal power of one or more received signals e.g. one or more received tones .

To estimate a loop length the example loop tester of includes a loop length estimator . The example loop length estimator of uses received signal power values measured by the example power meter to estimate the length of a subscriber loop e.g. the example subscriber loop of . Knowing the transmitted signal level of a tone e.g. 20 dBm Hz the example loop length estimator can determine the attenuation of the tone. Then for example the loop length estimator can use a database e.g. table that associates for a particular frequency signal attenuation values with loop lengths to determine e.g. estimate a length of the subscriber line. If more than one signal attenuation value is available possibly for more than one frequency the loop length estimator estimates a loop length based on each of the signal attenuations and then averages the estimated loop lengths to obtain a single estimated loop length. Other methods and apparatus to estimate loop lengths given one or more signal attenuation values are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 751 353 filed on May 21 2007 and entitled Methods and Apparatus to Characterize a Digital Subscriber Line DSL Subscriber Loop. 

To identify a device customer premise and or subscriber associated with a received signal the example loop tester of includes a loop identifier . The example loop identifier demodulates e.g. using amplitude demodulation phase demodulation and or CDMA demodulation one or more received signals to decode an identifier associated with a NID an ONU a DSL modem a tone generator a subscribe line a customer premises and or a subscriber.

To store test and or identification results the example loop tester of include a loop database interface . The example loop database interface allows the loop tester to store estimated loop lengths and associated identifiers in a database e.g. the example loop database of . Database updates may be performed when a loop length and or identifier is determined and or may be stored by the loop database interface for subsequent storage in the database.

The example loop tester of is contained and or implemented within a housing . The example housing of has a form factor of a battery powered portable and or handheld device. However the example housing may have other form factors. For example the housing may be a rack mountable device suitable for use and or installation within a central office and or DSLAM. Additionally or alternatively the housing may have a form factor suitable for mechanical and or electrical connection to a portable computing device such as a laptop computer and or personal digital assistant.

While an example manner of implementing any or all of the example loop testers and of has been illustrated in one or more of the elements processes and or devices illustrated in may be combined divided re arranged omitted eliminated and or implemented in any other way. Further the example interface s the coupling circuit the example power meter the example loop length estimator the example loop identifier the example loop database interface and or more generally the example loop tester of may be implemented by hardware software firmware and or any combination of hardware software and or firmware. Further still the example loop tester of may include one or more elements processes and or devices in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated elements processes and devices.

The example machine accessible instructions of begin with a loop tester e.g. the power meter of measuring the received signal level of a received signal block . The loop tester e.g. the example loop length estimator then estimates the length of the subscriber line on which the signal was received block . The loop tester e.g. the example loop identifier then demodulates the received signal to obtain an identifier used to modulate the received signal block . Next the loop tester e.g. the example loop database interface stores the estimate loop length and any determineed identifier in a database e.g. the example database of and or within the loop tester for later storage in the database block . If more subscriber loops are to be tested and or identified block the loop tester e.g. the example controller directs a switch e.g. the example switch to couple the next subscriber line to the loop tester block . Control then returns to block to measure a received signal level on the next subscriber line. If no more subscriber lines are to be tested and or identified block control exits from the example machine accessible instructions of .
