Hereinafter a process in which the respective functional units described above with reference to are operated depending on an input of a user through the interfaces of will be described in detail. Hereinafter it will be assumed that the users register accounts corresponding to one or more service apparatuses such that account information is stored in the account information registerer .

The user requests the bulletin board information to the client connector using the client . The client connector transmits the bulletin board information request received from the user to the controller . For example the user has accessed a web page A through the client and the web page A is a web page displaying the bulletin board information including a reply bulletin board a bulletin board displaying a reply See provided by the apparatus for relaying a service.

The controller may search the message stored in the message storage depending on the bulletin board information request generate the bulletin board information including the searched message and transmit the generated bulletin board information to the client through the client connector . For example the controller transmits the bulletin board information including the reply bulletin board to the client through the client connector depending on the bulletin board information request.

The client displays the bulletin board information and then receives an input for log in from the user. For example the user selects any one of the icons of the service display interface of . Here in the case in which the user selects an icon of the service display interface in the state in which he she does not currently perform the log in the bulletin board information may include the open API requesting log in to the service apparatus corresponding to the selected icon and interworking with the apparatus for relaying a service. Therefore in the case in which the client receives an input for selecting the icon of the service display interface of the bulletin board information it requests the log in to the service apparatus corresponding to the icon through the open API. Then the client receives and displays a web page for log in from the service apparatus and receives an input for log in of the user through the received web page. Therefore the service apparatus may perform the log in with respect to the user and transmit a log in completion signal indicating that the log in has been completed to the service connector after the log in has been completed. The service connector transmits the log in completion signal to the controller . Here the log in completion signal may include an access token corresponding to an account logged in in the service apparatus .

That is in the case in which the client is logged in the first service apparatus and an access token included in a log in completion signal for the second service apparatus is not included in account information corresponding to an account of the first service apparatus the account information registerer of the apparatus for relaying a service may allow the access token corresponding to the second service apparatus to be included in the account information.

Although the case in which both of the log in and the account information update described above are performed using the access token included in the log in completion signal has been described the apparatus for relaying a service may also be implemented in a scheme of using password for each account.

Hereinafter a process in which the user performing the log in sets a representative account will be described with reference to . Here the representative account indicates an account of the service apparatus mainly used by the user in the reply bulletin board. In the case in which the user input a reply the bulletin board information including the reply bulletin board may display an account through which the reply is input as the representative account. That is as represented by of an icon of the service apparatus corresponding to the representative account and an ID of the representative account may be displayed.

The user performs an input for selecting any one of the icons of the service display interface . Here in the case in which the input for selecting the icon of the service display interface is generated in a log in state the bulletin board information may include a script displaying the representative account setting interface . Therefore the client displays the representative account setting interface depending on the input of the user. In this case the user may select the displayed representative account setting interface . Therefore the client may transmit a representative account request signal requesting to set the representative account to the client connector . Here the representative account request signal may include information for identifying a service apparatus corresponding to the icon selected in the service display interface . The controller receiving the representative account request signal through the client connector transmits the representative account request signal to the account information registerer . The account information registerer sets a representative account in account information corresponding to a corresponding user depending on the representative account request signal.

Hereinabove the process in which the apparatus for relaying a service sets the representative account has been described.

Hereinafter a process in which the apparatus for relaying a service inactivates one or more of the registered accounts will be described.

The client receives an input for selecting one of the icons of the service display interface from the user. The client displays the inactivation interface depending on a script included in the bulletin board information. Then the client may receive an input for selecting the inactivation interface from the user. The client transmits an inactivation request signal requesting inactivation of an account corresponding to the selected icon to the client connector . Here the inactivation request signal may include an ID of the account corresponding to the selected icon. The controller receiving the inactivation request signal through the client connector transmits the inactivation request signal to the account information registerer . The account information registerer modifies the account information so that an account corresponding to the ID included in the inactivation request signal is inactivated.

Interworking between the service apparatuses may be stopped with respect to the account inactivated by the above mentioned process. This will be described later in detail with reference to .

Hereinabove the process in which the apparatus for relaying a service inactivates the account has been described. Hereinafter a process in which the apparatus for relaying a service performs log out for each account will be described in detail.

The client receives an input for selecting one of the icons of the service display interface from the user. The client displays the inactivation interface depending on a script included in the bulletin board information. Then the client may receive an input for selecting the log out interface from the user. The client transmits an inactivation request signal requesting log out of an account corresponding to the selected icon to the client connector . Here the inactivation request signal may include an ID of the account corresponding to the selected icon. The controller receiving the inactivation request signal through the client connector performs the log out through an open API provided by the service apparatus corresponding to an ID included in the inactivation request signal.

Although the case in which the log out is performed for individual accounts has been described above the bulletin board information may include a separate interface requesting log out for all accounts. Therefore the apparatus for relaying a service may perform log out processes for all accounts through the open APIs of the respective service apparatuses .

Hereinabove the processes in which the apparatus for relaying a service performs the log in the setting of the representative account the setting of the inactivation and the log out have been described with reference to . Hereinafter a process in which the apparatus for relaying a service relays a service in the state in which it is logged in a plurality of accounts will be described.

Referring to in the case in which the user inputs a message through the bulletin board information the apparatus for relaying a service may provide the corresponding message to the service apparatus .

The client receives the message input from the user and transmits the message to the apparatus for relaying a service .

The apparatus for relaying a service confirms account information corresponding to the message received from the client . That is the apparatus for relaying a service searches the account information registerer to confirm the account information on the user.

The apparatus for relaying a service confirms IDs for the first service apparatus and the second service apparatus included in the account information confirmed in Step and transmits the message to accounts depending on the corresponding IDs respectively and . That is the apparatus for relaying a service transmits the message to each of the first service apparatus and the second service apparatus through an open API. Here the apparatus for relaying a service may convert the message received in Step into message bulletin formats of the respective service apparatuses . This will be described later in detail with reference to .

The first service apparatus and the second service apparatus provide SNS services bulletining each of the messages received through the open API and .

Hereinabove the process in which the apparatus for relaying a service transmits and relays the message received from the client to the respective service apparatuses has been described. Hereinafter a process in which the apparatus for relaying a service transmits a reply notifying message to the respective service apparatuses in the case in which it receives a reply message from the client will be described with reference to .

The apparatus for relaying a service confirms account information on a user corresponding to a text of the reply message . That is the reply message received in Step may be a reply to a specific message or a reply to a reply of the specific message. Therefore the apparatus for relaying a service may store data indicating users inputting the respective replies bulletined on the reply bulletin board and may identify the user corresponding to the text of the reply message with reference to the stored data. Therefore the apparatus for relaying a service confirms the account information stored in the account information registerer to confirm the account information on the user corresponding to the text. For example the apparatus for relaying a service confirms that the first text writer and the second text writer in the reply bulletin board are the user corresponding to the text of the reply message received in Step and confirms the account information on the corresponding user.

The apparatus for relaying a service transmits a reply notifying message to the service apparatus corresponding to the account information and . Here the reply notifying message is a message notifying a user that a reply to a sentence bulletined by him her is written. The apparatus for relaying a service may generate the reply notifying message so as to include a content of the reply message a representative account of the user writing the reply message and a uniform resource locator URL of a web page on which the reply message is written through the message converter . For example the apparatus for relaying a service generates the reply notifying message and transmits the reply notifying message to the first service apparatus and the second service apparatus corresponding to the account depending on the account information confirmed in Step .

The first service apparatus and the second service apparatus bulletin the reply notifying message and .

Referring to a message converter of the service apparatus converts a message input by a user into a message to be displayed in the bulletin board information and into a message to be bulletined on the respective service apparatuses .

For example the message converter receives a message I think that our goals should be changed written by the first text writer. Since a corresponding message is an original sentence rather than a reply it is not a sentence bulletined while pointing out a specific user. Therefore the message converter does not perform message conversion on the original sentence.

Then the message converter receives a reply message Mmm I oppose it input by the second text writer. Here since the reply input by the second text writer is a reply to the original sentence input by the first text writer it is a message to be sent to the first text writer. Therefore the message converter inserts receiver identifying information T ABC indicating that the reply is the message to be sent to the first text writer into the reply message. Here T indicates a text hereinafter referred to as a service identifier identifying the service apparatus corresponding to a representative account of the first text writer ABC indicates an ID representative account of the first text writer and indicates a distinguisher distinguishing between the ID and the service identifier. Therefore T ABC indicates a message to be sent to a user of which an account ID of a service apparatus corresponding to T is ABC . The message converter transmits a display message into which the receiver identifying information is inserted to the controller and the controller inserts the corresponding display message into bulletin board information and outputs the bulletin board information into which the corresponding display message is inserted to through the client .

In this case the message converter converts the reply input by the second text writer into a message having a format appropriate for being bulletined on a service apparatus corresponding to the representative account of the first text writer. For example the message converter inserts ABC and a URL of a web page on which the second text writer writes the reply into the message to generate a conversion message. Here ABC is an identifier indicating who a receiver of the corresponding message is in the first service apparatus . ABC may be differently changed depending on a scheme in which an identifier identifying a receiver is configured in the service apparatus. The message converter transmits the conversion message to the controller . The controller may transmit the conversion message to the first service apparatus through the open API to allow the conversion message to be bulletined in an SNS of the first text writer.

Then the message converter receives a reply to the reply of the second text writer. The message converter inserts receiver identifying information corresponding to the first text writer and the second text writer into a message of the reply to the reply of the second text writer to generate a display message. In addition the message converter may insert an identifier having a format corresponding to each of the first service apparatus and the second service apparatus and identifying a receiver into the message of the reply to the reply of the second text writer and insert a URL of a web page on which the reply to the reply of the second text writer is input into the message of the reply to the reply of the second text writer to generate the conversion message. The message converter may transmit the display message to the controller to allow the display message to be inserted into the bulletin board information and may transmit the conversion message to the controller to transmit the conversion message to each of the first service apparatus and the second service apparatus . Here the controller may generate information indicating what service apparatus the message has been transferred to and transmit the information to the client through the client connector .

Therefore the apparatus for relaying a service inputs messages in specific bulletin board information thereby making it possible to relay transmission of messages between heterogeneous service apparatuses . In addition the apparatus for relaying a service allows a message written as a reply by the user to be bulletined in an SNS of the user oneself or other persons thereby making it possible to prevent the user from writing a malicious reply using anonymity.
