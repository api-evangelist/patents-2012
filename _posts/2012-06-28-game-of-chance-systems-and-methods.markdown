This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 759 757 filed Apr. 14 2010 entitled GAME OF CHANCE SYSTEMS AND METHODS which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. That application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 194 593 filed Aug. 20 2008 entitled GAME OF CHANCE PROCESSING APPARATUS which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Games of chance have enjoyed widespread popularity. Traditional systems for playing these games suffer some drawbacks. Computer implemented systems may alleviate some of these drawbacks.

In various embodiments a player may play a second game while he s waiting during a first game. For example a player who is playing a game of poker with other live players may have to wait while the other players are deciding their move. During this wait time the player could play another game. The other game could even be based on aspects of the first game. For example a second game that a player plays while he waits for a first game to continue could be based on cards that have been dealt during the first game. For example the two cards dealt to a player in a game of Texas Hold em poker could serve as the starting hand for a game of blackjack that the player plays while he waits for the action to continue in a game.

In various embodiments a player may play in a first game via a network connection. The player may be playing in a game over the Internet while sitting at a game terminal while sitting at a gaming device or while using a mobile gaming device. Software within the player s personal computer betting terminal or other device may track cards or other outcomes that have occurred in a first game. The computer betting terminal etc. may allow the player to use those outcomes to serve as the basis for a second game. The betting terminal for example may allow the player to make an additional bet and or to initiate an additional game which is based off the initial game in which the player has been participating. The player may make decisions in the additional game such as decisions of whether to hit or stand in a game of blackjack or such as decisions of how many cards to draw in a game of video poker. The device of the player e.g. the betting terminal e.g. the mobile gaming device may then determine a final outcome of the game such as by dealing additional cards to the player. The device of the player may then determine a payout for the player. The player may then be paid e.g. through the crediting of a player account.

In various embodiments a player may be sitting at the same table as other players in a live game e.g. in a game of blackjack. While the player waits for another player s decision the player may begin playing a second game e.g. using a mobile gaming device. The second game may be based off cards or other outcomes or indicia that the player dealer or other players have received in the game. For example the player may have his player tracking card inserted into a slot corresponding to the player s position at the table. The casino may track cards that have been dealt to the player e.g. via a card reader built into an automatic shuffler or dealer used at the table. The casino may thereby determine what cards have been dealt to the player. Such cards may then serve as a basis for an additional game the player may play e.g. on his mobile gaming device.

In various embodiments one or more players may participate in a game over a network. In various embodiments two or more players may participate in a game over a network. The game may be a live game. One or more of such players may play from or using a player device such as a kiosk betting terminal mobile gaming device slot machine video poker machine or other device. In various embodiments players may not be physically proximate to one another. Rather players may be physically spread out such as throughout a casino throughout a city or even throughout the world. Nevertheless players may view images or representations of one another. By viewing representations of other players a player may feel a greater sense of camaraderie with the other players in the game.

In various embodiments a representation of a player may include a simulated character an avatar and or computer generated imagery CGI . A player may customize the character representing him. The player may customize the character to have a particular look e.g. hair color e.g. height e.g. girth to have particular expressions e.g. smiling e.g. frowning e.g. looking angry to have a particular voice e.g. a raspy voice e.g. a smooth voice and or to have any other characteristics.

In various embodiments a player may customize or select the actions that his character representation performs. A player may customize the manner in which his character rolls dice the manner in which his character deals cards the manner in which his player moves chips into the pot the manner in which his character collects money from the pot the manner in which the character thinks or contemplates e.g. the player holds his head between his hands the manner in which a character indicates a decision e.g. in a game of blackjack a character might indicate a hit decision by either thumping the table hard twice or by lightly tapping the table twice the manner in which a character walks e.g. the manner in which a player gets up and walks away from a table or any other mannerisms or actions of a character.

In various embodiments a player may select characteristics actions or other mannerisms of a character through navigating a set of one or more menus. For example a player may select a default expression for his character from among the following list happy sad angry grumpy bored excited crazy. Similarly the player may select a particular manner in which his character will take some action. For example a player may select from among the following list for how his character might roll the dice a throw the dice as hard as he can b shake the dice then roll them c roll them gently along the surface of the table d turn around and throw the dice over the back of his head e throw the dice from the side of his hand f throw the dice over his fingers g throw the dice one at a time.

In various embodiments a first player in a game may view the character representations of other players in his game. The player may view the other players via a monitor or display screen for example. If a player is at a terminal with multiple monitors the player may view a character representation of each other player in the game one other player per monitor for example.

In various embodiments games with multiple players may include craps poker blackjack roulette and other games.

In various embodiments an automatic card dealer may deal cards to a player. The dealt cards may be read utilizing various technologies by the dealing device. A terminal or kiosk may receive information about the cards from the dealing device so that the terminal may display information about the cards on a screen. The dealing device and or the terminal may also pipe information about the cards to other terminals or to other devices. This may allow other players besides the player at the immediate terminal to use information about the cards to participate in the game. In some embodiments other players may participate e.g. play e.g. bet on in the same game as the player immediately at the terminal plays in. In some embodiments cards dealt by the dealing device may be used by a player at a first terminal for a first game and by a player at a second terminal for a second game.

In various embodiments a terminal may show a display of a floor plan or other physical space such as a casino floor plan. The floor plan may show the locations of certain games such as the locations of certain slot machines or such as the locations of certain table games. In some embodiments a player at the terminal may select a game from the display e.g. from the display of the floor plan . A card dealer from the selected game may read cards dealt at the game and may transmit information about such cards to the terminal. The player at the terminal may then participate in the live game and or may participate in a separate game which is based on the live game.

In various embodiments the terminal may have various input devices such as input buttons. In various embodiments input buttons may allow the player to make standard decisions in games. A terminal may have buttons e.g. dedicated buttons for making a decision to hit or for making a decision to stand in a game of blackjack. A terminal may have a button to draw a button to hold and or a button to discard where such buttons may be utilized in a game of video poker.

In various embodiments a first player at a first terminal may have the ability and or the option to link with a second player at a second terminal. The first player and the second player may compete against one another such as by playing different positions in the same game. For example the first player and the second player may play a game of Texas Hold em poker against one another. In some embodiments the first player and the second player may link together to cooperate. For example the first and second players may both wish to participate in a game of blackjack with a minimum 50 bet. However both the first and second players may wish to bet a maximum of 25 each. Thus the first and second players may pool their bets so as to participate in the game of blackjack. In various embodiments a first player may link to a second player so as to piggyback off the decisions made by the second player. The first player may for example participate in games played by the second player. The first player may copy all the decisions made by the second player in the game. Thus the first player may benefit from the skill of the second player. For example the second player may be an experienced blackjack player while the first player may be a novice. In various embodiments the first player may get advice from the second player. The second player may provide advice over a text channel and or over a voice channel for example. Game outcomes achieved by the first player may be automatically displayed at the terminal of the second player. For example the first player s initial hand of blackjack may be automatically displayed for the second player to see at the second player s terminal. The second player may thereby have the opportunity to provide advice to the first player.

In various embodiments a first player may peruse a display which shows information about potential other players to whom the first player might link up. For example a display may provide a list of other players. The display may show geographically the locations of second players. The list may show whether or not a second player is available for linking up to the first player e.g. whether the second player is willing to link up e.g. whether the second player is not already involved in a sufficient number of games to occupy him . The display may show any other pertinent information about other players. For example the display may show demographic information about other players. The first player may choose other players to whom to link up based on desired demographic characteristics.

In various embodiments a terminal may include an input device which converts player motions into game commands. The input device may detect the motion of the device as a whole including forward and backward motions twisting or turning motions up and down motions accelerations and decelerations and any other motions. The input device may contain accelerometers gyroscopes and or other devices for detecting motion.

In various embodiments an input device that converts motion into commands may be connected to the terminal via a cord. The cord may bring power to the input device. The cord may also transmit signals from the input device to the terminal. In some embodiments the input device may not be physically attached to the terminal. The input device may be battery powered powered through motion or powered in some other fashion. The input device may communicate with the terminal via wireless signals such as via Wi Fi or via infrared communication.

Motions of the input device may be translated into various game commands or into other commands. For example motions may be translated into amounts to bet into decisions to be made in a game or into any other commands.

In various embodiments a device at the terminal may track the motion of a player s eye. For example a camera may be pointed at the eye level of a typical player e.g. at the eye level of a person of average height . Image processing algorithms may determine whether the pupil of the eye is looking straight into the camera to the left to the right up down etc. Such image processing algorithms may recognize the degree to which the pupil is centered or off centered. It may thereby be determined what the player is focusing on at any given moment in time. As will be appreciated other methods of tracking a player s eye motion may also be employed.

In various embodiments a first player may make a bet that a second player will fare better than does a third player. A second player may fare better than a third player by winning more games winning more money winning more high paying outcomes or by exceeding any performance metric of the third player. Thus in various embodiments a first player may bet that a performance metric or statistic describing a second player will exceed a performance metric or statistic describing the third player. In various embodiments a first player may bet that a performance metric or statistic applied to a second player will exceed the same performance metric or statistic applied to the third player. In various embodiments the second player and the first player may be one and the same. Thus for example a first player may bet that he will perform better than another player. A first player may bet that he will perform worse than a second player.

A bet that a second player will fare better than a first player may pertain to some time period. For example a first player may bet that a second player will win more than does a third player over a period from 2 00 pm to 3 00 pm in the afternoon. A bet that a second player will fare better than a third player may apply to sessions or to trips. For example a first player may bet that a second player will fare better during his trip to Las Vegas than does a third player during her trip to Las Vegas.

In various embodiments a performance metric may apply to different players over different time periods. For example a first player may bet that a second player will win more money from 3 00 pm to 4 00 pm than does a second player from 5 00 pm to 6 00 pm. As another example a first player may bet that a second player will win more money from 3 00 pm to 4 00 pm than does a second player from 3 00 pm to 5 00 pm.

In various embodiments the performance of a second player relative to a third player may be compared even if the second and third players play different games. For example the second player may play slot machines while the third player plays blackjack at a live table game. Though the two players play different games the winnings of the two players for example may still be compared.

A performance metric may measure any one or more of the following a an amount won b an amount wagered c net winnings d gross winnings e a number of payouts over a predetermined amount that have been won f a number of a particular outcome that has been achieved g a number of bonus rounds that have been achieved h a number of times any winning outcome has been achieved i a largest streak of winning outcomes j a level of skill employed and any other measure.

A bet on the relative performance of two players may be received by a casino. The bet may be received at a casino desk casino cage slot machine gaming device mobile gaming device kiosk over the Internet or in any other fashion. The first player placing the bet may identify a second player and a third player. The first player may identify a performance metric. The first player may identify which of the second or the third player he wants to bet on to have the superior or highest performance metric. The first player may select a time period as well. The first player may identify games or types of games that will be relevant for the performance metric. The first player may select any other parameters of the bet.

In various embodiments only certain games or only certain events are counted in determining how a player performed. For example a performance metric may describe the net winnings achieved by a player at table games. Thus if the player plays both table games and slot machine games during the time period of the bet the games at the slot machines may not count towards determining the performance metric.

In various embodiments players may compete in a gaming tournament. The winner may be determined based on some performance metric applied to all players in the tournament. Thus for example if the performance metric is a total amount won then the winning player may be determined based on which player in the tournament has won the most during the time period of the tournament. In various embodiments a computer player or simulated player may participate in a tournament. Thus it may be possible for only a single living human to participate in a tournament.

In various embodiments players may compete in a tournament over a given time period with all players competing during the same time period. In some embodiments players may compete during different time periods. For example a first player may compete from 4 00 pm to 6 00 pm while a second player competes from 7 00 pm to 9 00 pm. The performances of the two players may still be compared against one another.

In some embodiments each player in a tournament has a fixed amount of money to bet. For example each player has 2000 to bet. Players may be free to bet the money in any manner they wish. For example a player may be free to make 2000 1 bets or to make 20 100 bets. The fixed amount of money may be toy money or play money . For example the money may not be actual U.S. currency and may be useable only for play in a tournament. In this case players may be able to use what feels like a large amount of money without they themselves or the casino having to outlay a large amount of actual U.S. currency. In some embodiments a player is responsible for using his own money to play in a tournament. For example a player bets 2000 of his own money in order to complete a tournament.

In various embodiments the winner of a tournament may be the player who wins the most money. In various embodiments the winner of a tournament may be the player who wins the most times. In various embodiments the winner of a tournament may determined based on any one or more of the following a the player with the highest gross winnings b the player with the highest net winnings c the player with the most payouts over a certain amount d the player who has reached the most bonus rounds e the player who has won the most payouts over a predetermine amount f the player who has the highest credit balance e.g. at the end of the tournament period g the player who has won the most per unit time or any other criteria or metrics.

In order to be eligible to win a tournament and or to win a prize in a tournament a player may have to comply with certain rules or criteria. Any one or more of the following rules may apply to tournament play a a player must play a minimum number of games b a player must play no more than a maximum number of games in some embodiments the player may play more than the maximum number of games but the extra games don t count c a player must play a certain type of game e.g. poker e.g. blackjack e.g. video poker e.g. Wheel of Fortune d a player must bet a minimum aggregate amount e the player must bet no more than a maximum aggregate amount f each bet made by a player must be a certain minimum amount e.g. 1 g each bet made by a player must be no more than a maximum amount h a player must play at a particular table i the player must play at a particular gaming device j the player must use a particular mobile gaming device k the player must use a particular betting terminal l the player must use only mobile gaming device though the player may be free to use more than one during the tournament period or any other rules. In various embodiments if a player plays a game or takes some other action that is not in accordance with tournament rules the game or action may not count towards the tournament.

In various embodiments a player may join a tournament. For example the player may provide his name provide an indication of a desire to participate in the tournament provide a registration fee acknowledge that he has read or understands tournament rules and or take any other actions to get involved in the tournament. When a tournament begins the player may provide his identity to a gaming device that he is using. For example a player may keep a tracking card inserted into a gaming device that he is using. In this way the gaming device may track the play of the player and allow such play to be counted towards the tournament results. In some embodiments a player may use a mobile gaming device to compete in a tournament. The mobile gaming device may be specifically assigned to that player. In some embodiments the player may wear a wristband or other device which communicates with the mobile gaming device and which identifies the player to the mobile gaming device. The player s play at the mobile gaming device may thereby be tracked. Thus the player s play at the mobile gaming device may count towards the results of the tournament.

In various embodiments a player may compete in a tournament through bets made on other players. For example a secondary player may make a bet on a game being played by a primary player. The secondary player may bet for example that a primary player will win a live game in which the primary player is playing. The results of the bet of the secondary player may count towards the results of the tournament.

In various embodiments performance metrics for one or more players in a tournament may be available for viewing by other people such as by other players in a tournament. In some embodiments for example performance metrics for the five tournament leaders may be publicly displayed or made available to other tournament participants. Leaders may be listed by name alias or other identifier. Leaders performance metrics may be posted. For example the leaders gross winnings may be listed. With information about other participants made available tournament participants may be able to plan or change their own methods of play accordingly. For example a player who is well behind the leaders may decide to increase his bet size while a person who is in the lead may decide to reduce his bet size so as to minimize risk. In various embodiments a player in a tournament may view his own standings in the tournament. For example a player may view where he currently ranks among all players or how far he is from the leader e.g. according to the relevant performance metric .

In various embodiments a casino server or other device may track the progress of all players engaged in tournament play. The casino server may periodically determine performance metrics for all the players in the tournament. The casino server may use the performance metrics to sort the players and thereby to rank them. The casino server may make the rankings available for display. The rankings may be available for display at a slot machine video poker machine gaming device gaming terminal mobile gaming device kiosk or at any device such as any device connected via a network to the casino server. Thus for example a player at a slot machine may select an option to view the current tournament rankings or standings for players participating in the same tournament in which he is participating.

In various embodiments a paper display may be used as or in conjunction with a mobile gaming device. A paper display may include a display that has one or more of the following properties a it is extremely thin e.g. thinner than 1 or 2 millimeters b it is flexible e.g. it can be bent wrapped or folded and c it is light weight. A mobile gaming device may include an electronic paper display manufactured or developed by E Ink Corporation.

Various events at a casino may occur too quickly for a player to perceive or too quickly for a player to fully enjoy. For example when dice are thrown in a game of craps the dice may be spinning many times per second. The tumbling of the dice and the bouncing of the dice may occur too quickly for a player to perceive every bounce and rebound. Thus in various embodiments a player may wish to view the events such as the rolling of dice at a slower pace.

In various embodiments cameras or other imaging devices may capture footage of events. The cameras may include high speed cameras. Such cameras may capture hundreds thousands or tens of thousands of frames per second for example. Footage captured from events at a casino may be made available to players for viewing. The footage may be played back at a different speed from that at which the event occurred. For example an event that unfolded over a 1 second period may be replayed so that the event appears to unfold over a period of 20 seconds.

In some embodiments a player may not watch an original event but may instead watch a replay such as slow motion replay of the event. In this way a player may experience more suspense and excitement as he anticipates the final resolution of the event.

Events that may be captured and replayed include the rolling of dice the spinning of a roulette wheel the dealing of cards the spin of slot machine reels the spin of bonus wheels on gaming devices e.g. the spin of a Wheel of Fortune or any other events.

In various embodiments special cameras or other imaging devices may be focused on places where events of interest are to occur. For example a high speed camera may be built into a craps table to capture the rolling of dice. A high speed camera may be built into a roulette table to capture the spinning of a roulette wheel. In various embodiments a camera may capture game events as well as other events throughout a casino. For example a camera may capture footage of people walking through a casino in order to look for security problems. The same camera may also capture the action at a game. Footage taken by the camera may be used to replay action from the game.

In various embodiments cameras in a casino could photograph people. The photos could later be sold to the people or provided as a guest service.

In various embodiments a picture which includes a first person e.g. the subject of the picture may incidentally include a second person e.g. an incidental passer by . Regulations privacy concerns or other concerns or issues may make it desirable to remove the image of the second person from the photo before the photo is sold or otherwise provided to the first person or to some other person . Thus in various embodiments a photo may be taken of one or more people. It may then be determined which people are meant to be in the photo and which are not. The people who are not meant to be in the photo may then be removed. In place of the people removed from the photo background footage of that same area may be inserted e.g. background footage that had previously been captured . In some embodiments incidental passers by who appear in a photo may be grayed out or blurred but not completely eliminated. The blurring process may prevent such people from being easily identified. In various embodiments if an incidental passer by appears in a photograph the passer by s consent may be obtained before the photograph can be distributed e.g. to the main subject of the photo.

In various embodiments a person may wear or carry an item which identifies that person as someone who wants or is willing to have his picture taken. A person might wear a bracelet or another special item of clothing. A mobile gaming device or other portable device might signal to an overhead camera that a person wants a photo taken. In various embodiments a gaming device may include a camera. The camera may photograph a person when his player tracking card is in the gaming device or when the gaming device senses the presence of a mobile gaming device. If the player is to get his photo taken the player may have some indication on record associated with his account that he wants photos to be taken.

In various embodiments a camera may be placed so as to photograph a particular area. A person may be directed to stand or sit in that area so as to be photographed. For example a person may wish to be photographed while rolling dice. The person may be directed to stand in a particular area while rolling the dice. An area may be designated through markings on the floor. For example a circle may be marked on the floor. A person may stand in the circle in order to have his photo taken.

In various embodiments a person may control a camera with a mobile gaming device or with motion control device. For example a person may stand near a ceiling mounted camera. The person may signal the camera by clicking three times on a button on the motion control device. Then the person might move the device left or right in order to direct the camera to turn left or right. When the camera is pointing at the person the person may move the motion control device up and down in order to direct the camera to take a picture.

In various embodiments a camera may include an antenna array or other detector which can detect the direction from which a signal is coming. A person at a casino may carry a mobile gaming device. The mobile gaming device may emit a signal which can be detected by a ceiling mounted camera or by another camera for example. The camera may lock onto the signal and then point towards the source of the signal. The mobile gaming device may then direct the camera to take a picture. The camera may wirelessly transmit the picture to the mobile gaming device.

In various embodiments an event may occur out of sight of an interested party. The event may have occurred in a different location from where the interested party is located. The event may have occurred at a time before the interested party arrived at the location of the event. The event may have been missed by the interested party because the interested party was looking away or not paying attention. According to various embodiments one or more details of an event are recorded. Details may be recorded using a recording device such as a camera microphone scanner or any other device. In a game for example a card shuffler may incorporate scanners to scan in card images of cards that are dealt. The details may then be stored in a server or in some other computer or computing device. The details may be stored in a networked environment and made available to one or more other computing devices connected to the network. The details may later be accessed by one or more other computing devices.

In various embodiments recorded details of an event may be used to reconstruct the event. Recorded details may first be interpreted. For example image processing algorithms may determine the rank and suit of a card that has been dealt based upon a captured image of the card. Details of an event may be interpreted by the server storing such details or by any other computing device.

After details of an event have been interpreted representations of the event may be constructed. For example a cartoon representation of an event may be generated based on recorded details of the event. For example a representation of a card may be generated by a computer.

Representations of events may then be presented to people. Representations may be presented in the form of video audio tactile sensations or in any other form. In various embodiments representations of games which have been played may be presented to people who were remote from such games or who did not see the games when they happened. People may include secondary players or players who bet on the outcomes of games without directly participating in the games themselves.

In various embodiments details of an event are not interpreted. Rather details of events are presented just as they were recorded. For example a video of an event may be presented.

In various embodiments players at a gaming table may be sitting shoulder to shoulder with other players and may generally have little space to put cash gaming chips food drinks or other items. Further players may have limited space to view desired information such as information about other players information about game statistics or information unrelated to a game. According to various embodiments a terminal with a plurality of screens allows a player to view a number of information feeds and many different types of information. A desk area at the terminal allows the player space to put personal items or gaming items. Various buttons allow the player to call up information on demand. A player may also in various embodiments participate in games at the terminal. Thus the terminal may serve to alleviate space constraints present with traditional gaming tables.

Using a terminal a first player may call up information about a second player. The first player may call up information indicating how many times the second player has won or lost in a given period of time. The first player may call up information indicating what strategies the second player has used. The first player may call up information indicating an amount that has been won or lost by the second player. The first player may call up any other information about the second player. The first player may view multiple different items of information such as different statistics about a second player or such as a given statistic about many different other players e.g. amounts won by each of 10 other players .

The terminal may also include various input devices such as keyboards computer mice telephone pads cameras microphones and other input devices. The player may use the input devices to indicate his desire to see information about other players information about any games that he is currently playing or any other information.

In various embodiments people participating in a mutual event may be unable to congregate in the same physical location. For example people may have physical frailties that inhibit easy movement from one place to another. In a casino for example players may wish to play in the same poker game but may be unable or unwilling to all move to the same area of a casino. Thus in various embodiments each of a plurality of players may go to his or her own terminal. The terminal may include a number of display screens. Each display screen may display an image of another player participating in the same poker game. Each terminal may include a camera. The camera may capture an image of the player at the terminal. Images captured by the camera may be transmitted to a central server. The server may in turn transmit the images from the camera to the terminals of other players. The terminals of other players may receive the images and such images may be posted on one of the display screens at a terminal. Accordingly a player may sit at a terminal and play games against other players at other terminals. The player may see each of the other players on one of the display screens his own terminal. In various embodiments players may also have audio links to one another. Each player terminal may include a microphone. Words spoken into the microphone may be captured sent to the central server and forwarded to the other terminals. The other terminals may broadcast the spoken words to the players at those terminals. Accordingly a first player may say something like bet or raise after which other players may hear the spoken word at another terminal. Thus in various embodiments players may engage in a game traditionally played in person but remotely from other players. The terminal may still allow a player to clearly see and hear all the other players.

In various embodiments a terminal with multiples screens e.g. with 6 screens may allow a player to engage in the play of multiple games at once. Traditionally a player at a gaming device such as a slot machine may have limited space on a display screen with which to view the action in a game. A terminal according to various embodiments provides numerous display screens. The display screens may be spread out in semi circular fashion in front of the player. Thus the player may have plenty of viewing space on which to view the action in multiple games at once.

In various embodiments an apparatus combines information from a live game played at a table with additional information to allow for game play by another player who is not at the table. An information capturing device sits in proximity to a table. For example a camera films the play at a table. Details of game play are captured by the information capturing device. The details are transmitted to a central server. The details may then be interpreted to determine salient game information such as what cards have been dealt or what a dealer s hand is. Additional information may then be generated. This additional information may include new cards dice rolls indicia or other game outcomes or results. The additional information may be used in conjunction with information from the live game in order to create a new game or game experience for the player at the terminal. A computer processor of the terminal generates cards for a player. The processor uses random number generators for example to select cards to deal to the player. Whether the player has won or lost is then determined based on the additional information generated and based on the salient game information from the live game. For example the player may receive a blackjack hand that is generated by the processor of his terminal. The player s hand may then be compared to the dealer s hand from the live blackjack game. The comparison may be performed by the processor of the terminal using standard rules of blackjack.

The term determining and grammatical variants thereof e.g. to determine a price determining a value determine an object which meets a certain criterion is used in an extremely broad sense. The term determining encompasses a wide variety of actions and therefore determining can include calculating computing processing deriving investigating looking up e.g. looking up in a table a database or another data structure ascertaining and the like. Also determining can include receiving e.g. receiving information accessing e.g. accessing data in a memory and the like. Also determining can include resolving selecting choosing establishing and the like.

The term determining does not imply certainty or absolute precision and therefore determining can include estimating extrapolating predicting guessing and the like.

The term determining does not imply that mathematical processing must be performed and does not imply that numerical methods must be used and does not imply that an algorithm or process is used.

The term determining does not imply that any particular device must be used. For example a computer need not necessarily perform the determining.

Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature e.g. a limitation such as at least one widget covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article the to refer to the limitation e.g. the widget this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature e.g. the widget can cover both one widget and more than one widget .

When an ordinal number such as first second third and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For example a first widget may be so named merely to distinguish it from e.g. a second widget . Thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget 1 does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location 2 does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time and 3 does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality. In addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.

When a single device article or other product is described herein more than one device article whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single device article that is described. Accordingly the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device article whether or not they cooperate .

Similarly where more than one device article or other product is described herein whether or not they cooperate a single device article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For example a plurality of computer based devices may be substituted with a single computer based device. Accordingly the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device article.

The functionality and or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality features. Thus other embodiments need not include the described device itself but rather can include the one or more other devices which would in those other embodiments have such functionality features.

The term product means any machine manufacture and or composition of matter unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term process means any process algorithm method or the like unless expressly specified otherwise.

Each process whether called a method algorithm or otherwise inherently includes one or more steps and therefore all references to a step or steps of a process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term process or a like term. Accordingly any reference in a claim to a step or steps of a process has sufficient antecedent basis.

The term invention and the like mean the one or more inventions disclosed in this application unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms an embodiment embodiment embodiments the embodiment the embodiments one or more embodiments some embodiments certain embodiments one embodiment another embodiment and the like mean one or more but not all embodiments of the disclosed invention s unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term variation of an invention means an embodiment of the invention unless expressly specified otherwise.

A reference to another embodiment in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment e.g. an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms including comprising and variations thereof mean including but not limited to unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term herein means in the present application including anything which may be incorporated by reference unless expressly specified otherwise.

The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the phrase at least one of a widget a car and a wheel means either i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheel. The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things does not mean one of each of the plurality of things.

Numerical terms such as one two etc. when used as cardinal numbers to indicate quantity of something e.g. one widget two widgets mean the quantity indicated by that numerical term but do not mean at least the quantity indicated by that numerical term. For example the phrase one widget does not mean at least one widget and therefore the phrase one widget does not cover e.g. two widgets.

The phrase based on does not mean based only on unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase based on describes both based only on and based at least on . The phrase based at least on is equivalent to the phrase based at least in part on .

The term represent and like terms are not exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the term represents do not mean represents only unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase the data represents a credit card number describes both the data represents only a credit card number and the data represents a credit card number and the data also represents something else .

The term whereby is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words that express only the intended result objective or consequence of something that is previously and explicitly recited. Thus when the term whereby is used in a claim the clause or other words that the term whereby modifies do not establish specific further limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claim.

The term e.g. and like terms mean for example and thus does not limit the term or phrase it explains. For example in the sentence the computer sends data e.g. instructions a data structure over the Internet the term e.g. explains that instructions are an example of data that the computer may send over the Internet and also explains that a data structure is an example of data that the computer may send over the Internet. However both instructions and a data structure are merely examples of data and other things besides instructions and a data structure can be data .

The term respective and like terms mean taken individually . Thus if two or more things have respective characteristics then each such thing has its own characteristic and these characteristics can be different from each other but need not be. For example the phrase each of two machines has a respective function means that the first such machine has a function and the second such machine has a function as well. The function of the first machine may or may not be the same as the function of the second machine.

The term i.e. and like terms mean that is and thus limits the term or phrase it explains. For example in the sentence the computer sends data i.e. instructions over the Internet the term i.e. explains that instructions are the data that the computer sends over the Internet.

Any given numerical range shall include whole and fractions of numbers within the range. For example the range 1 to 10 shall be interpreted to specifically include whole numbers between 1 and 10 e.g. 1 2 3 4 . . . 9 and non whole numbers e.g. 1.1 1.2 . . . 1.9 .

Where two or more terms or phrases are synonymous e.g. because of an explicit statement that the terms or phrases are synonymous instances of one such term phrase does not mean instances of another such term phrase must have a different meaning. For example where a statement renders the meaning of including to be synonymous with including but not limited to the mere usage of the phrase including but not limited to does not mean that the term including means something other than including but not limited to .

Neither the Title set forth at the beginning of the first page of the present application nor the Abstract set forth at the end of the present application is to be taken as limiting in any way as the scope of the disclosed invention s . An Abstract has been included in this application merely because an Abstract of not more than 150 words is required under 37 C.F.R. 1.72 b .

The title of the present application and headings of sections provided in the present application are for convenience only and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.

Numerous embodiments are described in the present application and are presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not and are not intended to be limiting in any sense. The presently disclosed invention s are widely applicable to numerous embodiments as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed invention s may be practiced with various modifications and alterations such as structural logical software and electrical modifications. Although particular features of the disclosed invention s may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and or drawings it should be understood that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described unless expressly specified otherwise.

No embodiment of method steps or product elements described in the present application constitutes the invention claimed herein or is essential to the invention claimed herein or is coextensive with the invention claimed herein except where it is either expressly stated to be so in this specification or expressly recited in a claim.

The preambles of the claims that follow recite purposes benefits and possible uses of the claimed invention only and do not limit the claimed invention.

The present disclosure is not a literal description of all embodiments of the invention s . Also the present disclosure is not a listing of features of the invention s which must be present in all embodiments.

Devices that are described as in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. On the contrary such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for long period of time e.g. weeks at a time . In addition devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.

A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components features are required. On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of the present invention s . Unless otherwise specified explicitly no component feature is essential or required.

Although process steps algorithms or the like may be described or claimed in a particular sequential order such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In other words any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described or claimed does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order possible. Further some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non simultaneously e.g. because one step is described after the other step . Moreover the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention s and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.

Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps that does not imply that all or any of the steps are preferred essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other processes that omit some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly no step is essential or required.

Although a process may be described singly or without reference to other products or methods in an embodiment the process may interact with other products or methods. For example such interaction may include linking one business model to another business model. Such interaction may be provided to enhance the flexibility or desirability of the process.

Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components aspects qualities characteristics and or features that does not indicate that any or all of the plurality are preferred essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. Likewise an enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the enumerated list a computer a laptop a PDA does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are equivalent to each other or readily substituted for each other.

All embodiments are illustrative and do not imply that the invention or any embodiments were made or performed as the case may be.

It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various processes described herein may be implemented by e.g. appropriately programmed general purpose computers special purpose computers and computing devices. Typically a processor e.g. one or more microprocessors one or more microcontrollers one or more digital signal processors will receive instructions e.g. from a memory or like device and execute those instructions thereby performing one or more processes defined by those instructions. Instructions may be embodied in e.g. one or more computer programs one or more scripts.

A processor means one or more microprocessors central processing units CPUs computing devices microcontrollers digital signal processors or like devices or any combination thereof regardless of the architecture e.g. chip level multiprocessing multi core RISC CISC Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages pipelining configuration simultaneous multithreading .

Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of an apparatus for performing the process. The apparatus that performs the process can include e.g. a processor and those input devices and output devices that are appropriate to perform the process.

Further programs that implement such methods as well as other types of data may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media e.g. computer readable media in a number of manners. In some embodiments hard wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in place of or in combination with some or all of the software instructions that can implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus various combinations of hardware and software may be used instead of software only.

The term computer readable medium refers to any medium a plurality of the same or a combination of different media that participate in providing data e.g. instructions data structures which may be read by a computer a processor or a like device. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory DRAM which typically constitutes the main memory. Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves light waves and electromagnetic emissions such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM an EPROM a FLASH EEPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave as described hereinafter or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data e.g. sequences of instructions to a processor. For example data may be i delivered from RAM to a processor ii carried over a wireless transmission medium iii formatted and or transmitted according to numerous formats standards or protocols such as Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 SAP ATP Bluetooth and TCP IP TDMA CDMA and 3G and or iv encrypted to ensure privacy or prevent fraud in any of a variety of ways well known in the art.

Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of a computer readable medium storing a program for performing the process. The computer readable medium can store in any appropriate format those program elements which are appropriate to perform the method.

Just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the described steps are required embodiments of an apparatus include a computer computing device operable to perform some but not necessarily all of the described process.

Likewise just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the described steps are required embodiments of a computer readable medium storing a program or data structure include a computer readable medium storing a program that when executed can cause a processor to perform some but not necessarily all of the described process.

Where databases are described it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that i alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed and ii other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed. Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored representations of information. Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by e.g. tables illustrated in drawings or elsewhere. Similarly any illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information only one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those described herein. Further despite any depiction of the databases as tables other formats including relational databases object based models and or distributed databases could be used to store and manipulate the data types described herein. Likewise object methods or behaviors of a database can be used to implement various processes such as the described herein. In addition the databases may in a known manner be stored locally or remotely from a device which accesses data in such a database.

Various embodiments can be configured to work in a network environment including a computer that is in communication e.g. via a communications network with one or more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or indirectly via any wired or wireless medium e.g. the Internet LAN WAN or Ethernet Token Ring a telephone line a cable line a radio channel an optical communications line commercial on line service providers bulletin board systems a satellite communications link a combination of any of the above . Each of the devices may themselves comprise computers or other computing devices such as those based on the Intel Pentium or Centrino processor that are adapted to communicate with the computer. Any number and type of devices may be in communication with the computer.

In an embodiment a server computer or centralized authority may not be necessary or desirable. For example the present invention may in an embodiment be practiced on one or more devices without a central authority. In such an embodiment any functions described herein as performed by the server computer or data described as stored on the server computer may instead be performed by or stored on one or more such devices.

Where a process is described in an embodiment the process may operate without any user intervention. In another embodiment the process includes some human intervention e.g. a step is performed by or with the assistance of a human .

The present disclosure provides to one of ordinary skill in the art an enabling description of several embodiments and or inventions. Some of these embodiments and or inventions may not be claimed in the present application but may nevertheless be claimed in one or more continuing applications that claim the benefit of priority of the present application.

Applicants intend to file additional applications to pursue patents for subject matter that has been disclosed and enabled but not claimed in the present application.

In a claim a limitation of the claim which includes the phrase means for or the phrase step for means that 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 applies to that limitation.

In a claim a limitation of the claim which does not include the phrase means for or the phrase step for means that 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 does not apply to that limitation regardless of whether that limitation recites a function without recitation of structure material or acts for performing that function. For example in a claim the mere use of the phrase step of or the phrase steps of in referring to one or more steps of the claim or of another claim does not mean that 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 applies to that step s .

With respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 the corresponding structure material or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof may perform additional functions as well as the specified function.

Computers processors computing devices and like products are structures that can perform a wide variety of functions. Such products can be operable to perform a specified function by executing one or more programs such as a program stored in a memory device of that product or in a memory device which that product accesses. Unless expressly specified otherwise such a program need not be based on any particular algorithm such as any particular algorithm that might be disclosed in the present application. It is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art that a specified function may be implemented via different algorithms and any of a number of different algorithms would be a mere design choice for carrying out the specified function.

Therefore with respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6 structure corresponding to a specified function includes any product programmed to perform the specified function. Such structure includes programmed products which perform the function regardless of whether such product is programmed with i a disclosed algorithm for performing the function ii an algorithm that is similar to a disclosed algorithm or iii a different algorithm for performing the function.

Where there is recited a means for performing a function that is a method one structure for performing this method includes a computing device e.g. a general purpose computer that is programmed and or configured with appropriate hardware to perform that function. Also includes a computing device e.g. a general purpose computer that is programmed and or configured with appropriate hardware to perform that function via other algorithms as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Numerous references to a particular embodiment does not indicate a disclaimer or disavowal of additional different embodiments and similarly references to the description of embodiments which all include a particular feature does not indicate a disclaimer or disavowal of embodiments which do not include that particular feature. A clear disclaimer or disavowal in the present application shall be prefaced by the phrase does not include or by the phrase cannot perform .

Any patent patent application or other document referred to herein is incorporated by reference into this patent application as part of the present disclosure but only for purposes of written description in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 1 and enablement in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 1 and should in no way be used to limit define or otherwise construe any term of the present application where the present application without such incorporation by reference would not have failed to provide an ascertainable meaning but rather would have allowed an ascertainable meaning for such term to be provided. Thus the person of ordinary skill in the art need not have been in any way limited by any embodiments provided in the reference

Any incorporation by reference does not in and of itself imply any endorsement of ratification of or acquiescence in any statements opinions arguments or characterizations contained in any incorporated patent patent application or other document unless explicitly specified otherwise in this patent application.

In interpreting the present application which includes the claims one of ordinary skill in the art shall refer to the prosecution history of the present application but not to the prosecution history of any other patent or patent application regardless of whether there are other patent applications that are considered related to the present application and regardless of whether there are other patent applications that share a claim of priority with the present application.

In various embodiments a gaming system provides a platform for rapid play of card games for maintenance of proper odds in games for more easy viewing of the gaming experience by a player for remote playing by a player for allowing players to play each other when the players are not near each other and for other benefits.

In various embodiments a computerized gaming system manipulates electronic representations of cards. The gaming system may randomly determine an order of cards using e.g. pseudo random algorithms. The gaming system may then deal cards to one or more players by sequentially dealing the cards to one or more players and or to a house or dealer. Depending on the game players may make one or more bets. Bets may be keyed in using any of a number of possible interfaces such as buttons touch screens computer mice trackballs and so on. Depending on the game players may make one or more decisions in a game including decisions concerning whether to be dealt another card whether to fold whether to split their hands or whether to make any other appropriate decision. Players may make decisions using any number of interfaces such as using computer mice buttons touch screens trackballs or any other interfaces.

In various embodiments a computer system reshuffles cards after each game or after a small number of games. The reshuffling may be performed electronically and so may occur near instantaneously. This may save time over a shuffling process that would be performed with a physical deck of cards.

Reshuffling a deck of cards after each game may ensure that odds in each game remain constant or relatively constant. For example if cards are reshuffled after every game then counting strategies used in blackjack or other card games may be rendered less effective or completely ineffective.

In various embodiments cards numbered 1 through 6 or equivalently labeled for example are used to play a game of craps or to play another dice game. For example in a game of craps a roll is simulated with the deal of two cards. As will be appreciated each roll of the dice is considered to be an independent random event. However with a deck of cards used to conduct a game of dice one could in principle make a prediction as to the next deal based on previous cards dealt. This is because each card dealt alters the composition of the remaining deck by depleting the deck of one card now known.

A computerized system according to various embodiments may allow games using cards to more closely simulate games using dice. The computerized system may do this in some embodiments by frequently reshuffling electronic decks so that new cards dealt are independent of prior cards dealt just as new rolls of dice would be independent of prior rolls of dice.

A computerized system may also simulate an infinite deck or a very large deck of cards. An infinite deck or very large deck may be impractical with respect to a physical deck of cards. To simulate an infinite deck of cards a computer system may deal a randomly chosen card when required. However after each card is dealt the computer may make no change to its selection process e.g. the computer may make no assumptions that a deck of remaining cards has been depleted. Thus the computer may on the next card deal the exact same card that it had previously dealt. As will be appreciated there may be other ways of simulating an infinite deck. When an infinite deck is used the odds of certain cards being dealt do not depend on what cards have previously been dealt. Thus an infinite deck may be used to closely simulate a game of dice.

A computer system for playing card games according to various embodiments features a zoom or magnification option. A player can press a button to increase the size of cards displayed on his screen. The player may further touch particular cards on a touch screen or otherwise indicate such cards. The cards that a player has indicated may expand in terms of their display size on a display screen so that they are more easily visible to a player. The player may also reduce the size of cards or other items displayed e.g. so as to increase his field of the game. For example where a player is playing against multiple opponents the player may shrink the view of an individual opponent s cards so as to be able to see all opponents cards at once on the same display screen.

In various embodiments a game may be played at a physical gaming table. The table may include a felt tabletop with markings chip racks seats positions for players and positions for dealers. However some players at the table may be visually challenged and unable to see cards bets or other items at the table. According to some embodiments a camera or other imaging device may capture an image of the table. The image may be displayed on a monitor or other display screen proximate to the player. The player may be able to change the magnification of the image by zooming in or zooming out. Thus a visually impaired player may still be able to follow the action at a table my referring to a display screen where he can magnify an image of the display screen.

In various embodiments a computer system is designed to allow simultaneous actions or decisions by players in a game. In some embodiments players compete against one another in a card game using the rules of blackjack for example. Players bet and raise each other by putting money into a pot. The winning player is the player who has a hand with the point total closest to 21 without exceeding 21. In some embodiments games can be played with different maximum point totals e.g. with 22 as a maximum point total. In some embodiments in such a game a first player may derive an advantage by delaying a decision to hit or stand until he has seen whether or not another player has chosen to hit or stand. Thus to prevent any one player from deriving an advantage game rules may dictate that all players in game should make a particular decision e.g. a hit stand decision simultaneously or at least without knowledge of other players hit stand decisions.

In various embodiments a computer system may receive decisions from multiple players in a game. As the computer system receives each decision the computer system may store the decision in a computer memory. The computer may track how many player decisions have been received. When all player decisions have been received the computer system may reveal all decisions to all players such as by showing the words hit or stand on a diagram representing player positions at a virtual table and or by showing the actual cards.

In various embodiments each player in a game may be prompted to make a decision in turn with the decision not being made known or only partially known to other players. For example a player may make a hit decision with the resulting card being shown only to that player. Alternatively the player may make the hit decision with the resulting card being shown only to that player but with other players receiving an indication of the decision. In either case another player may then be prompted to make a hit decision either having no or only limited knowledge of the pervious hit decision i.e. when an indication of the decision was at least provided . At some later time such as at the end of the game for example all cards may then be made visible to all players.

In a similar fashion in various embodiments a computer system may allow simultaneous bets to be placed. For example all players in a game may simultaneously make the decision to bet or not and when all player decisions have been received reveal all decisions bet amounts to all players. Thereafter a player s that entered a lesser amount than another may be prompted to fold or enter an additional bet such that all players have entered an equal amount for example. In this way no one player can gain an advantage by watching others bet before making his decision to bet.

In traditional games of blackjack it may not be desirable to allow players to touch cards. When players touch cards there is a risk that the players will mark the cards or even replace the cards with card that are more to their benefit. In traditional games of blackjack cards are dealt face up so there is no particular need for a player to touch a card because the player can see everything he needs to know about the card without touching it. However if cards were dealt face down a player may be unable to see the card without touching it.

Computer systems according to various embodiments allow certain cards to be visible only to an individual player and not his opponents while still making it unnecessary for a player to touch his cards. A computer system according to various embodiments allows players to play blackjack against one another for example. Each player is dealt at least one card which he is privileged to know but which no other player knows. The system allows players to play at remote devices terminals computers mobile gaming devices or other interfaces. Since the players are separate from one another cards can be displayed on a first player s terminal without risk that the cards would be visible to other players. A given player s terminal may display some of the cards belonging to other players but not all cards belonging to other players. For example in a game of blackjack each player may begin with a hand in which one card is private visible only to that player and in which one card is public visible to all players and or may receive a hit that is kept private visible only to that player or public visible to all players . At some later time such as at the end of the game for example all cards may then be made visible to all players.

Interface screens used with the computer system may thus display cards for players to see privately without the necessity of players touching cards.

In some embodiments a physical table such as a blackjack table may include display screens. However the screens may be viewable from only a very narrow viewing range e.g. due to barriers placed along the sides of the display screen.

Such screens may also allow players to privately view cards without the necessity of having them touch cards.

In various embodiments any device that includes a display e.g. a mobile gaming device e.g. a slot machine e.g. a personal computer may display some or all cards dealt in a game. For example a mobile gaming device may display not only the cards dealt to a particular player but may also display cards dealt to all other players. For instance in the early phases of a game a player may be able to see only the cards in his own hand. However at the end of a game a central server may transmit to all player devices an indication of all cards that had been dealt to all players in the game. Each player device may then display the cards of every player in the game. In this way a player may be able to verify for himself why he won or why he lost since he may be able to compare the value of his hand with the value of the other players hands.

A traditional craps table has one or more walls or barriers. The dice can be thrown against the wall to ensure the randomness of the throw. The wall further prevents the dice from escaping the confines of the table surface. In various embodiments a game of craps or another dice game is played at a table without walls and or without confinement of any kind. Cards are used at the table in place of dice. Cards are dealt from a deck consisting of only cards numbered 1 through 6. Since the cards are not thrown like dice confinement for cards may be unnecessary. Therefore various embodiments may include a table for craps without walls. The table may include standard felt markings such as areas for a pass line bet a come bet a don t pass bet odds bets and other standard areas. However the table may lack walls.

In various embodiments players may play blackjack versus one another using a mobile gaming devices. Players may each carry a handheld gaming device i.e. mobile gaming device . Each mobile gaming device may be in communication with a central server. A player may use his mobile gaming device to enter decisions in a game. Decisions may include indications of amounts to bet indications of whether to hit or stand etc. A mobile gaming device may have buttons corresponding to one or more possible decisions. For example there may be a hit button stand button a double down button and other buttons appropriate to blackjack. The mobile gaming device may transmit the decisions made by players to the central server. The central server may shuffle cards using an electronic shuffling algorithm. The central server may use other algorithms for determining what cards should be dealt to what players. The central server may then transmit to each mobile gaming device an indication of cards that have been dealt. At the end of the game the central server may reference a set of game rules e.g. game rules that are stored in computer memory in order to determine a game winner. The central server may then provide an indication to each participating player of the game winner. The central server may also reveal hidden cards for one or more players and transmit an indication of such cards to other players.

The central server may maintain an account associated with a player. The account may comprise one or more records stored in a database. The records may be stored in computer memory. A player account may include information such as a name of a player an address of a player any other identifying information about a player and or any other information about a player. The account may further include information about a monetary balance a balance of casino credits or any other balance of value. Thus the account may store a record of how much money belongs to a player. In various embodiments when a player indicates a bet or wager such as at a mobile gaming device the server may deduct the amount of the bet or wager from the player s account. In various embodiments when the player wins money the money won may be added back to the player s account.

In various embodiments a player device such as a mobile gaming device personal computer standalone slot machine or other device may prompt a player to take an action in a game. For example a mobile gaming device may display text prompting the player to either hit or stand in a game of blackjack. A player device may prompt a player to make a bet. For example a player device may prompt a player to decide whether to bet the pass line or the don t pass line in a game of craps. As another example a player device may prompt a player to decide how much to bet in a game. A central server may initiate prompt messages and transmit such messages to a player device at which time the player devices may display the prompts. In some embodiments a player device may initiate prompts e.g. when logic stored within the device determines that a prompt must be shown to encourage a player to take action and move a game along.

Various embodiments pertain to the playing of casino table type games such as roulette dice and cards from remote locations while viewing actual games being played at a casino or similar location.

One of the games played in a casino is roulette. This game is played at a table around which a number of players sit or stand and bet by placing chips on a betting grid of numbers in blocks intersections of blocks black and red plays and odd and even number selections. A wheel is spun and a ball falls into a numbered pocket as the wheel stops thereby determining the winner of the game who is paid off at various odds depending upon the type of bet placed. Such a game is played at casinos throughout the world. There is usually a considerable amount of interest and excitement around the table as the game is played.

The game of roulette is also played via the Internet. Here there is a computer generated simulation of the roulette table betting grid and spinning wheel. This type of game originates from any location capable of housing the computer and having the necessary telecommunication connections. The player can play the game for fun only or make wagers over the Internet such as by establishing and using a credit card account. The Internet and other telecommunication media may permit playing roulette from any location in the world having the necessary equipment.

A similar situation exists with other casino table games such as blackjack dice and baccarat. In each of these games players place bets on a table and there is player interaction as the game is played as well as reaction in the crowd watching.

In various embodiments a player establishes an information link with a casino from an interface station including a video monitor and keypad. In response to the player s entry of financial account information the casino establishes an information line with the player s financial institution. The casino assigns the player to a gaming table at which a live game is occurring transmitting all images of game play and instructions to the player. The player transmits bet and game play information to the casino. Because of the open line between the casino and player s financial institution bets are checked winnings paid and losses debited.

Various embodiments include a system and method for playing a roulette game in an interactive manner at a site remote from the actual casino table while still having a view of and experiencing the live casino action where the game is being played. In accordance with various embodiments a camera follows a game that is being played at a roulette table in a casino. A microphone can also pick up the sound of the players at the table and the game play.

In some embodiments terminals are provided at various locations in the casino remote from the table. The terminals are connected to a distribution device that provides the necessary communication between the players at the remote terminals and the game being played at the casino table.

A remote terminal accepts cash or credit cards to set up an account for the player. The remote terminal displays a picture video of the actual casino table where the game is being played. The remote terminal also contains its own computer microprocessor that has various functions. Among these are the generation and display of an electronic representation of the table betting grid this display also having a touch type keypad in some embodiments. The player at the terminal uses the keypad and electronically places a bet on the computer representation of the table betting grid under the casino house roulette rules in the normal manner. He also uses the touchpad to select the amount of the bet to be placed. The remote terminal microprocessor is programmed with the required information of odds to pay off when the player makes a winning bet.

At the casino table the croupier conducts the game in the normal manner. At a given time normally just before or when the ball is placed in the spinning wheel no more bets are accepted. This is signaled to the computers at the remote terminals which locks out the players at these terminals from placing any more bets. The players at the remote terminals can watch the actual game play at the casino table and the reactions of the players. When the ball drops in the wheel pocket and the game at the casino is finished the player sees the winning number result. The result also is also made available electronically at the remote terminals.

In various embodiments the remote terminal microprocessor maintains the terminal player account balance information. Upon the result of the game winning number being transmitted to the remote terminal the terminal microprocessor make a calculation against the bet made. If the bet was a loss then the amount of the bet is subtracted from the player s account. If the bet was a win the amount of the win is calculated at the usual casino odds or at some other odds as set and the appropriate amount of the win is credited to the player s account.

Various embodiments pertain to players who are not at the casino and effectively can be located anywhere in the world. Here the game being played at the casino is followed by the camera and the picture of the game play and results are transmitted via telecommunications to remote locations. The transmission mode can be the Internet satellite or other wired or wireless communication system to players who play the roulette games using devices such as personal computers or modalities such as a TV set connected to the Internet with control boxes such as offered by WEBTV or AOLTV. The devices can be either of stationary type or of the portable type which can communicate by wireless. A program can be installed in or downloaded to the remote player s device that has the features of the previously described casino remote terminal such as betting odds calculation generation and display of a betting grid placing a bet on the grid etc.

In the remote player embodiments the game being played at the casino may be viewed and the game play sounds heard by the player at the remote location. The player maintains an account preferably at his own device that can have access to a central computer such as at a bank or credit card company in communication with the player s device. The player follows the table game by viewing the transmission from the camera. When a game is completed at the casino the result is transmitted and the player s computer makes the necessary win and loss calculations based upon the result of the game and this is entered in the player s account at his device.

In some embodiments a player who is not at the casino table experiences the actual table play and crowd response and is able to make wagers without having to be physically present at the game table in the casino. The results of a bet are computed at the location of the player and the player is presented with a running total of his account so he can see the results of his wager and monitor the amount wagered.

Various embodiments pertain to games played at a table such as blackjack dice baccarat and similar games.

Various embodiments may allow players to play roulette and other casino table type games at remote locations while following an actual game that is being played at a casino table and using the results of the casino game to determine betting results.

Various embodiments provide a system and method for playing roulette and other casino table type games in which a player at a terminal or other device remote from a game played at a casino game table follows the game at the casino table in which the player uses a computer located at the terminal or device to place bets and in which computations are made of the winnings and losses as the actual game is played.

Various embodiments provide a method and system for viewing a roulette or other table game played at a casino from a remote location from which bets are made and wins and losses are adjusted against an account balance of the remote player.

Shown located above the table is a video camera B such as a video camera that is of the full color type. The camera B can be hidden as are many cameras in a casino used for surveillance purposes or can be a stand alone visible type if for example the presence of the remote play feature is to be advertised. The camera field of view may be limited to the hands of the players as they place bets on the table and may not show the faces of the players. This may be done to maintain privacy. A microphone B is also placed adjacent the table to pick up the crowd noise of the players. The microphone can be directional to pick up the sound of the spinning wheel and ball.

The output cable B of the camera B and the output cable B of the microphone B are shown. These are connected to a distribution device B at a suitable location that includes the type of broadcast facility that is to be used for the system. For example if the game is to be used only with remote terminals at the casino then there would be a type of a closed circuit TV system. If the camera and audio output is to be broadcast over the Internet then there would be a suitable transmitter such as by streaming video and streaming audio . If broadcast is to be by satellite then there would be communication such as by digital transmission.

Also associated with the table B is a control box B. This is to be used to indicate specific events of a game during its play such as start of a game and the close of betting for a game that is betting status signals. The control box B can be actuated in a suitable manner such as manually actuated by the croupier voice actuated and actuated at a remote location such as by an operator at a central location that monitors play at a table. In some embodiments the control box B can be associated with physical devices such as for example a tray T in which the game ball B is placed and which has a micro switch or other type of sensor. Placing the ball in the tray triggers a signal that indicates the start of betting for a new game and removing the ball from the tray to place it in the wheel triggers a signal that the betting for the game is terminated. The close of betting also can be indicated by a motion detector or the video camera each for sensing start of spinning of the wheel and opening of betting for a new game by sensing the wheel stopping its rotation. These betting status signals are transmitted via the distribution device B to the remote terminals.

Terminal B also includes a computer module B which has a microprocessor and a memory. The computer module preferably is of the type that makes the terminal B self contained. That is it has an application program that can generate various displays perform the necessary computation for the odds of playing a game and for keeping a running account of the wins and losses of the player. The terminal computer module B receives the betting result and betting status data type signals produced at the table B.

Remote terminal B also includes a display B which basically comprises three sections. The display B is controlled by the terminal computer module B and a connecting communication line B between the two is shown. The display B essentially is an electronic table having features that corresponds to the actual casino table.

The display B has a section Bthat displays a computer module B generated simulation of the table betting grid. This section also can display other information such as the odds for various bets and bet combinations. The latter type of information can be displayed continuously or only on demand.

The second section Bof the display B is a touch type screen that has a numeric keypad B with the usual 0 9 numbers a touch type Enter key B and a display window B that displays data that has been entered. As part of a menu on the touch screen Bis a set of keys for the selection of the type of bet that is straight number combination of numbers red black and odd even. The third section Bdisplays the account balance of the player. All of the sections of the display B are generated and controlled by the terminal computer module B.

The terminal B audio module B also interacts with the computer module B. The audio module can be used to provide information to help the player place his bets. For example it can give messages to the effect that a new game is starting direct a player to place a bet on grid number s and indicate that betting is closed. Instead of the audio messages the messages can be displayed on any one of the sections of display B and there can be a combination of audio and visual messages.

A bill acceptor B is also part of the terminal B. Here the player inserts bills of currency to build up credits in his her account. The bill acceptor accepts currency of the type used at the casino or other type and of one or more denominations. As the player inserts one or more bills into the acceptor to open his account the value is displayed in the display section B. The acceptor B also can be replaced by a credit card reader or one can be provided in addition to the acceptor.

The remote terminal B also has an internal printer B. When the player completes play at the terminal he can request a printout of his account which is provided by the printer B. This can be presented to a cashier at the casino to be redeemed for cash or chips when there is a positive balance. If the player is playing via a credit card he can request from the terminal that winnings in his account as stored in the computer module B be electronically credited to his credit card account at a credit card company or bank. A player can obtain cash from a credit card such as from an ATM machine.

In the operation of a remote terminal B for a new player the player inserts bills into the acceptor B or uses a credit card. This opens the terminal and the amount of the account is displayed on section B. The player then selects a preferred bet amount that is the base amount of a bet such as would correspond to a chip. For example if a player opens an account for 100 and a preferred bet amount of 5 he would have the equivalent of 20 5 chips if actually playing at the casino table. A stack or stacks of electronic chips of the proper amount and values can be displayed such as on the electronic betting grid section B. The value of a chip can be any amount for example even as small as 25 cents. The small betting amounts usually are not permitted at the casino table which often has a minimum bet of 5 or 10. The remote terminals expand the customer base and the amount that the casino owner or game operator can make during game play.

The player views the play in process at the casino table on the video display B and can play along with the play at the casino. The video display B preferably is left on at all times to attempt to induce play at a terminal.

The player is advised that a new game is to start and to place his bet. The start of a new game message either audio or visual is triggered from the control box B associated with the casino table. For example as the ball B is placed in the tray Bat the casino table or the spinning of the wheel stops the distribution device at the casino broadcasts this to the remote terminals. The player enters his bet via the touch screen B. That is the player selects whether it is a straight number combination or other type of bet. Different types of bets can be made like playing at the casino table. At the time of placing a bet the player can consult the betting grid in display section B. Instead of a touch type screen section Bto designate the number s or other type of bet numbers can be selected by a computer mouse point and click arrangement on the electronic grid table B. This is of use particularly where the terminal is a PC or other device that is off the casino physical site. In a PC or similar device a part of the display screen can be used for the video display and another part for the computer generated functions such as the betting grid. In a device using an AOLTV or WEBTV converter box or similar device the display screen of a television screen would be similarly divided.

The type of bet selected is displayed in window B. The player enters the number or grid intersection numbers if the bet is a combination. This is also displayed in window B. The number intersection red black or odd even bet also is displayed on the electronic betting grid section B. The player then enters the amount of the bet which also is displayed in window B. The amount of the bet also can be displayed on the betting grid section Bsuch as by showing the stacking of the electronic chip or chips of the selected amount at the proper location of the grid. The chips that are bet are removed from the player s purchased stack of electronic chips.

The complete bet is displayed in window B. If it is acceptable the player touching the Enter key B. If not acceptable the bet is cancelled by touching a key on the keypad B such as the star key or a special Cancel key provided in section B. At this time the bet data is entered in the memory of the terminal computer module B. If a mouse is used there would be a point and click at an Enter or cancel box displayed on the screen.

The player can place additional bets for the game until a signal originating from the control box B at the casino game table such as by removing the ball B from the tray Bor the start of the wheel spinning indicates that the betting is closed for the present game. The computer B at the remote terminal is locked out from accepting any more bets. This can be indicated to the player at the remote terminal by one or both of an audio and computer generated visible message. During the time allotted for making bets the player at the terminal can watch the action of the players and the bets placed at the casino table B.

The game is played at the casino table B and the players at both the casino and at the remote terminals watch the wheel spinning and the ball dropping. The sounds at the table also are broadcast to the players at the remote terminals. The game result that is the winning number of the pocket into which the ball dropped and its color is sent from the casino distribution device B to the individual remote terminals. The computer module B at a remote terminal B uses the game result and the bet s placed information to compute whether there was a loss or a win. If a loss the computer subtracts the amount of the bet from the player s account. If there was a win the remote terminal computer module B computes the amount of the win in accordance with the odds of the type and the amount of the bet. That is each of straight number and number combination have different odds and red black and odd even have the same odds but different from the number type bets. The computer B has a program that provides for this calculation. The calculated win amount is then credited to the player s account. The account amount is displayed in the display section B

As can be seen a player at a location remote from the actual casino table can follow an actual game and can experience much of the actual casino player reaction and sounds. This makes the remote player s participation in playing much more realistic and interesting.

The foregoing description is based on a standard casino setting such as found in Nevada and New Jersey U.S.A. It also applies to private casinos. That is a religious or veterans organization holds a gambling night. The roulette table and camera would be brought to the location of the organization as well as remote terminals and communication apparatus. The remote terminals can be placed throughout the location for those who like to play alone or to handle any overflow.

Various embodiments are described relative to a roulette table but have application to other casino table play type games. For example there can be a dice table at the casino which has the camera and microphone described above. Here the remote terminal would have a video display of the casino dice table and a compute generated representation of the table. The player at the remote terminal places a bet and plays along with the player at the casino. Here also appropriate betting status signals are sent to the remote terminals to designate the opening and closing of betting placing additional bets and results of the game. As before a program in the remote terminal computer module calculates the winning based on house or other odds and credits this to the remote terminal player s account. Losses are subtracted.

The remote terminal video display of actual game content is also applicable to card games such as blackjack poker and baccarat.

A separate remote terminal can be provided for each type of game or a single universal terminal can be provided for two or more of the table games.

Specific features of the various embodiments are shown in one or more of the drawings for convenience only as each feature may be combined with other features in accordance with various embodiments.

A person skilled in the art will recognize that although computer system C is shown as a desktop personal computer other types of computers are contemplated in various embodiments. For example computer system C can also be an Internet appliance with monitor C keyboard C and mouse C integrated into the housing of computer C. Computer system C can also take other forms 

for example a personal digital assistant PDA or other handheld device or even a cellular telephone. Optional equipment not shown as part of computer system C in are other input output devices such as a printer. Also not shown in are the conventional internal components of computer system C e.g. a central processing unit memory file system etc. Similarly network C can be any variety of network such as a local area network LAN wide area network WAN wireless network or global network such as the Internet among others. Network C can also be any combination of the above networks used to connect computer system C and web site C.

Although shows web site C as being stored on server C within casino C a person skilled in the art will recognize that web site C can be stored on other servers. Similarly web site C can be accessible through server C or can be totally separate so that connecting to web site C does not require a path through server C. For example shows an alternative embodiment. In web site C is hosted by server C which is separate from casino C. Server C can be owned by casino C but physically separate from server C. In this embodiment where server C and server C are separate devices typically server C does not store any player tracking information which is preferably stored on server C. Server C can also be located in a different environment outside casino C. Or server C can be a third party server operated by a third party instead of casino C but perhaps with direction from casino C . A person skilled in the art will recognize other possible variations.

Even if casino C does not own or operate server C casino C will want to be able to track the player s activity on web site C. To enable this tracking server C can report the player s activities to casino C. Connection C enables server C to report a player s activities to casino C. A person skilled in the art will recognize that connection C does not have to be a direct physical connection. Instead server C can connect to casino C via network C.

Although show web site C as providing the on line equivalent of gaming in house at the casino web site C can provide other forms of entertainment to players. For example rather than playing for money web site C can offer players a play for fun site. In this configuration when players use web site C they are not risking their own money. Nevertheless casino C might want to track the player s activities to reward the player for loyalty. For example the player might earn points that are redeemable at the casino. Thus even though the casino does not directly profit from the player s activities there is an indirect profit motive as the player will eventually visit the casino to redeem the points accrued and hopefully spend money gambling at the casino. In addition if the casino offers multiple web sites to players some of the web sites can be configured for on line gaming and others can be configured for play for fun.

Returning to as the player plays in house at casino C playing for example slot machine C or blackjack table C information about the player s activity is tracked. Similarly as the player plays on line at web site C playing for example slot machine game C or blackjack game C information about the player s activity is tracked. In some embodiments the combined data is stored offsite in a secure server as shown in below . In a second embodiment the combined data is stored in server C. Regardless of where the data is stored the combined data gives the casino more information about the player that it might otherwise have had.

Although only show a single casino a person skilled in the art will recognize that various embodiments may include multiple casino properties. For example a single web site can track on line gaming activity for players registered with more than one casino property. In addition a single casino can have more than one web site hosted on one or more servers all of which can be distinct from server C with player tracking data being reported to server C. A person skilled in the art will recognize other possible variations.

ASP server C is responsible for managing secure communications between server C and secure server C. In a preferred embodiment server C sends eXtensible Markup Language XML requests to ASP server C which is the only device permitted to access secure server C behind firewall C. But a person skilled in the art will recognize that server C can communicate with ASP server C other than by using XML. By having secure server C communicate with ASP server C rather than secure server C sensitive data can be kept secure on secure server C but still accessible from outside firewall C if the request is transmitted in the correct manner. ASP server C can then communicate with secure server C to obtain the response to the requests which can be securely transmitted back to server C preferably using XML. Server C can then transform the XML response into HyperText Markup Language HTML using an eXtensible Stylesheet Language XSL Transformation XSLT . The resulting HTML can then be displayed to the player on computer system C.

Communication between server C and ASP server C may be encrypted. Any encryption scheme can be used the Secure Sockets Layer SSL encryption protocol used on the Internet is a standard that can be applied to encrypt the communication. Similarly communication between ASP server C and secure server C is preferably encrypted.

As an example of how the communications scheme of can be used consider the situation in which the player wants to update his personal information. In this example encrypted communications are not described but a person skilled in the art will recognize how to introduce encrypted communications into the example. Since personal information is sensitive the player would not want it publicly available the data would be stored on secure server C behind firewall C. So using server C the player can request to view his player data. It is assumed at this point that the player has identified himself to the system. The browser request made of server C is translated into an XML request of ASP server C which is forwarded to secure server C. Secure server C responds with the personal information which is formed into XML and forwarded to server C. Server C uses XSLT to transform the XML data into an HTML page which can then be presented to the user. Using a form the player can update his personal data. XML form data can then be posted to ASP server C which can update the database on secure server C. ASP server C sends an XML confirmation message back to server C which again uses XSLT to transform the XML confirmation message into HTML which can be presented to the user.

In some embodiments before a player can receive a benefit according to the player may be required to register with the casino. The most traditional way for a player to register with the system is to have the player come in to the casino to register. A casino employee enters player data either from a form prepared by the player or live as the player provides the data into a computer and gives the player a player card. Then when the player uses the player card at any gaming device the system can track the player s activity. The player card can also have a number imprinted on it that is unique to that player card the player can then use that number to identify himself for on line gaming.

Instead of having players come to the casino in person to register an account there are other ways in which players can be registered with the system. For example the player can fill out an electronic form over the Internet. The player can then be mailed the player card and or can be issued electronically an identification number that can be used for on line gaming.

Other ways can also be used to register the player. For example software exists that allow the Internet Protocol IP address of a computer to be located geographically. Using such software a player can be located without having to type any information. When the player first sets up his account the system can determine the player s location based on his IP address. But IP addresses identify computers not persons it is not possible to determine who is using the computer from the IP address. Further if IP addresses are dynamically assigned they do not even uniquely identify a computer.

Instead of assigning the player an identification number an existing ID for the player can be used. For example each state assigns persons in the state a unique driver s license number. The combination of the issuing state and the ID number can uniquely identify a player. The player can input this information to the system and the system can forward the information to a third party database. The third party database can then return information about the player. The combination of issuing state and ID number can be used both to obtain information about a player for registration purposes in setting up the player s account and for identification purposes for using the account .

In various embodiments a combination of methods is used to register a player. First the IP address of the computer is checked to determine the player s location. Then the player is prompted for his ID number and issuing agency. The ID number and issuing agency are forwarded to the third party database both to verify the player s location as determined by IP address and to obtain player demographic information. If the player s location is verified the account is registered using the player s IP address ID number and issuing agency. But if the player s location is not verified then the player is requested to telephone the casino or come in personally and have a casino employee register the player s account.

Various embodiments provide a gaming machine that may be customized according to one or more player preferences. A player may view and modify player preferences stored in a player preference account as preference account information. The preference account information may include but is not limited to loyalty point account information loyalty point account settings promotional opportunities preferred games preferred game features for the preferred games preferred gaming machine settings preferred bonus games preferred service options and preferred progressive games. The preference account information may be stored in a plurality of preference accounts on a preference account server. Using a preference account interface which may be compatible with a web browser a player may be able to view and modify preference account information stored on the preference account server from a number of remote devices such as a gaming machine a home computer a hotel room video interface and a casino kiosk.

It will be appreciated that the game of poker is a mixed game combining elements of both chance and skill or strategy. It is known for two or more players in a poker game to co ordinate their respective playing strategies in order to gain an advantage over the remaining players in the game thereby destroying the fairness of the game.

Some embodiments will be described with particular reference to a system for detecting and controlling collusion in a game of poker. However this application is not to be construed as limiting in various embodiments.

Referring to a system for detecting and controlling collusion in a game of poker is indicted generally by reference numeral D . The system D includes a gaming server D and a number of portals D D in the form of websites on the World Wide Web of the Internet. In this embodiment each one of the portal websites is an online casino website hosted on a corresponding casino web server not shown . For convenience various embodiments will be described with particular reference to only two such online casino websites D D . Each one of the casino websites D D is accessible by one or more would be poker players not shown . Each would be poker player accesses a casino website by means of a corresponding Internet enabled computer workstation having a display D and an associated pointing device D such as a mouse a touchpad and or any other device. In this embodiment casino website D is shown as having one computer workstation D logically connected thereto whereas casino website D is shown as being logically connected to two such computer workstations. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that such online casino websites D D can be logically connected to any number of computer workstations D simultaneously which number is physically limited only by considerations of processing power and Internet access bandwidth.

The system D includes further an administration facility D in the form of an application web server which is communicable with the gaming server D along a communication channel D . The detailed operation of the application web server D will be outlined in the description that follows. The system D also includes a collusion detection server D that is communicable with the gaming server D along the communication channel D .

The gaming server D the online casino web servers not shown corresponding to the online casino websites D D the computer workstations D the application web server D and the collusion detection server D are capable of communicating with each other by means of an open communication channel that is in this embodiment the Internet. Although the Internet is a single packet switched communication network it is represented in for convenience as separate logical communication channels D D D D D and D .

The application web server D maintains a clearing account facility D that has a clearing account corresponding to each one of the casino websites D D . Analogously each online casino web server D D includes a corresponding credit account facility D D with a credit account corresponding to each player who participates in the game of poker through one of the computer workstations D . In the illustrated embodiment the credit account facility D therefore has one player account associated with it while credit account facility D has two associated player credit accounts.

The gaming server D operates under control of a stored program capable of enabling a predetermined maximum number say 8 of players to participate in an instance of the game of poker. When the number of players reaches this predetermined maximum number the stored program causes a further instance of the game to be initiated the new instance also being capable of accommodating a further 8 players. In addition the stored program initiates different instances of the game for each one of a number of different levels of play that are in this embodiment 1 2 2 4 5 10 10 20 20 40 fixed limit games over 20 40 and pot limit games. In this manner the gaming server is capable under stored program control of spawning as many separate instances of the game as required in order to accommodate the requirement of a pool of players who desire to play the game at different levels of play in groups of a maximum of 8. Each instance of the game spawned in this manner is treated as totally independent of the other instances.

The online casino websites D D enable a player desiring to join the game to request by means of one of the computer workstations D participation in the game and once admitted to a particular instance of the game to place a wager on a turn of that instance. Each participating player is presented with an identical graphical user interface GUI on the display D of his respective computer workstation D by the stored program in the gaming server D . The GUI presents to the player a suitable display of a poker game not shown with appropriate icons that enable the player to make his own desired game play decisions and to monitor the progress of the game by viewing the game play decisions of the other participating players in the same instance of the game.

As shown in the stored program also provides a wagering means D operable by any participating player to place a wager on a turn of the game as well as a discrimination means D capable of determining whether any wager placed by any one of the participating players on the turn of the instance of the game of poker is successful or unsuccessful. The stored program in the gaming server D also maintains a dynamic register D of all players admitted to and actively participating in all the spawned instances of the poker from time to time together with data representative of a corresponding portal D D through which each participating player accessed the game. The dynamic register D also contains data representative of an instance of the game in which the player is participating. The application web server D also settles the wagers of the participating players after completion of every turn of all instances of the game.

In use a player wishing to participate in the game of poker uses a computer workstation D to access an online casino website D D of his choice. The player is presented with an icon not shown on the GUI on his computer workstation D which the user can activate in order to request participation in the poker game at a desired level of play. The user s request for participation is passed by the online casino website D D to the gaming server D which may adjudicate and process the request in the following manner 1. if all existing instances of the poker game at the desired level of play are currently being played by 8 players the existing instances of the game are all fully occupied and the would be player cannot be admitted. The user is notified of the situation and is prompted to join a waiting list of would be players 2. if any one of the existing instances of the poker game at the desired level of play does have a vacancy the would be player is removed from the waiting list and admitted to that instance of the game and an appropriate GUI is presented to the newly admitted player to allow him to play the game and to place wagers thereon 3. the register of active participating players is updated to include the details of the newly admitted player together with data representative of the online casino website Dor D from which the player was admitted to the game as well as the particular instance of the game to which he has been admitted 4. when the waiting list of would be players at any particular level of play has grown sufficiently large say 4 or 5 the gaming server spawns a new instance of the game at that level of play to accommodate the would be players in the waiting list and the list is flushed and 5. the register of active participating players is updated to include the details of all the newly admitted players in the newly spawned instance of the game together with data representative of an online casino website Dor D from which the players were admitted to the game as well as the particular instance of the game to which the players have been admitted.

Any player is able to leave the instance of the poker game in which he is participating at any time upon completion of a turn of that instance of the game. When a participating player leaves an instance of the poker game the player s departure results in the following actions 1. the GUI corresponding to the poker game on the computer workstation is replaced by one allowing the player to select another casino game to play 2. the departing player s details are removed from the register of active participating players and 3. the remaining instances of the game are analyzed in order to collapse any sparsely populated instances of the game and to consolidate the participating players in these instances into a single more densely populated instance of the game.

The participating players in any instance of the game utilize the wagering means D to place wagers from time to time on a turn of the poker game and to effect playing decisions required during the progress of the turn as described above. Once the turn of the game has been completed the discrimination means D determines which of the players is the winner of the turn and the application web server D settles the wagers placed by the participating players on that turn of the instance of the game as follows 1. the gaming server D notifies an online casino website D D associated with each player who has made a wager on the turn of the game. Each online casino website D D then debits the individual credit account of its associated player by an amount equivalent to the magnitude of that player s wager 2. the clearing account of an online casino website D D associated with each player who has made a wager on the turn of the game is then debited by an amount equivalent to the magnitude of that player s corresponding wager 3. the clearing account of an online casino website D D associated with the player who has made the successful wager on the turn of the game is credited by an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager and 4. the gaming server D also notifies the online casino website D D associated with the successful player and that online casino website credits the individual credit account of the successful player by an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager.

It is anticipated that the wagers placed by the participating players in the game will be made with credit purchased by such players prior to their participation in the game. For this purpose each online casino D D includes credit dispensing means not shown capable of dispensing credit to any player who wishes to participate in the poker game. The player may purchase credit by means of conventional credit or debit card payment facilities that are well known in the art and that will not be described here in detail. Whenever a player purchases credit from the credit dispensing means the corresponding online casino D D credits that player s credit account with an amount equivalent to the quantity of credit purchased by the player.

In various embodiments the application server D withholds a portion of the total of all the wagers on each turn of the game as a rake for the benefit of the operator of the gaming server D and the online casino websites D D . A portion of the rake is credited to the clearing account of each of the online casinos D D as a function of the proportion of players participating in the turn of the instance of the game through that particular casino website. In this variation of the embodiment the clearing account of the casino Dor D associated with the player who has made a successful wager on the turn of the game is credited with an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager less the amount of the rake. Analogously the credit account of the player who has made the successful wager is credited by an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager less the rake.

The collusion detection server D maintains a recording means in the form of a collusion detection database D the function of which will be described in greater detail below. The collusion detection server D operates under control of a stored program capable of logging the playing history of each player who participates in an instance of the game of poker at some time. The playing history includes an amount wagered on each turn of the game in which the player has participated as well as a corresponding outcome of the wager. The outcome of the wager is taken to be a profit made on the wager if successful and an amount of the wager that is forfeited by the player if the wager is unsuccessful. In this particular embodiment the outcome of the successful wager is thus the total of all the wagers by the participating players in the turn of the instance of the game of poker less the amount wagered by the winning player less the amount of the rake. The logged information is recorded in the collusion detection database D .

As shown in the stored program in the collusion detection server D provides a ranking facility D that is operable to derive from the logged playing history of each player a corresponding primary statistic. A player s primary statistic is re calculated by the ranking facility D each time the player s playing history is updated with the outcome of a further turn of the game in which the player has participated. The derived primary statistic is stored in the collusion detection database D . In some implementations a statistic related to a player s win loss ratio over a plurality of games played by the player may be calculated. Such information may be determined based on the number of games played the number of games won the amount of money won and so on.

The stored program in the collusion detection server D also provides a monitoring means D for continuously monitoring the primary statistic of any player in the collusion detection database D . The monitoring means D generates an output in the form of a flag when the primary statistic of any player changes by more than a predetermined threshold. Such a change indicates a change in that player s pattern of play and this may serve as an indicator of possible collusion by that player that is worthy of further investigation. In order to minimize the possibility of generating spurious flags the ranking facility D derives the primary statistic for a player once a playing history exceeding 300 turns of the game has been logged in the collusion detection server D . It is anticipated that a particular player s win loss ratio will differ according to a level at which the game is played the player being more cautious when playing the game at a high level. For this reason the ranking facility D computes a primary statistic for each player for each level at which the game may be played. In this instance the levels of play are games up to 1 2 games from 2 4 to 5 10 games from 10 20 to 20 40 fixed limit games over 20 40 Pot Limit games and No Limit games. Thus a primary statistic for a particular level of play will only be derived by the ranking facility D when a playing history of 300 or some other desired threshold turns of the game has been logged for that particular level of play.

The stored program in the collusion detection server D also provides a control facility D that acts on the flag generated by the monitoring means D by suspending the corresponding player from further participation in the game of poker.

The ranking facility D also computes a number of secondary statistics relating to each player. When the primary statistic has a positive value indicating a winning player a first secondary statistic is a breakdown of that player s winnings from the other players in the instance of the game. If an inordinate percentage of that player s winnings is derived from one or more other players the monitoring means D generates a flag. Such a skewed pattern of winnings is a further indicator of possible collusion by the winning player.

A further secondary statistic which is computed when the primary statistic for a player is negative indicating a losing player is a breakdown of that player s losses to the other players in the instance of the game. If an inordinate percentage of that player s losses are made to one or more other players the monitoring means D generates a flag.

A still further secondary statistic is computed as raises with without a Raising Hand R RH where R total number of raises and RH number of raising hands.

Each game play decision by a player to raise a prior wager is analyzed by an analysis facility D connected to the gaming server D . The analysis facility D evaluates whether the game play decision was optimal in the light of the cards in the players hand. A ratio close to 1 indicates that the player is raising correctly. A ratio significantly greater than 1 means that the player is raising too often with hands that are not adjudged to be raising hands. This indicates that the player is a poor player or a colluder and a flag is raised by the monitoring means D .

As a yet further statistic a player s losses arising from all raises are broken down and analyzed. An inordinately high proportion of losses to one or more other participating players causes the monitoring means D to raise a flag.

It is anticipated that the two previous secondary statistics can be advantageously employed to quickly analyze a new participating player. With a logged playing history of only 20 or 30 turns of the game these secondary statistics will be accurate enough to enable the monitoring means D to raise a flag when required.

Various embodiments provide a system and method for conducting sports and event betting. According to one aspect the ease of using a network e.g. the Internet cellular and or other type of network is combined with sports and event betting at a land based casino. Thus sport and other types of event betting are improved as betting is more convenient to the bettor.

According to one embodiment a bettor may sign onto a website e.g. through the Internet and or other type of network to place a bet on any sports or other event including professional and college football soccer baseball basketball auto racing and ice hockey as well as cricket rugby and various sports tournaments including the NCAA Men s and Women s Basketball Championships and World Cup Soccer. Other events upon which a bet may be placed include any type of event such as for example choosing the winner of a reality television show e.g. the Survivor reality show when the first person lands on Mars or the winner of the next United States Presidential election.

According to one embodiment a website e.g. made available through the Internet or other type of network includes a listing of all the possible bets that may be made. According to another embodiment the bettor may then select the wagers to be made on line and register the wagers to be made with the casino. One advantage of this is especially apparent for complicated or multiple selection events that may involve multiple selections of events to occur. For instance a bet involving the entire NCAA Men s Basketball Championship Tournament which has 63 games and 64 teams is a complicated bet that may require multiple event selections. In another example choosing a fantasy league team e.g. for the National Football League NFL may have as many as 30 team members or positions and as many as 60 choices for each position further complicating the wagering process. However such traditional wagers were limited to being placed in the gaming establishment by the bettor. According to one aspect the bettor is permitted to arrange the bet outside of the gaming establishment and to make payment for the bet in a legal manner.

According to various embodiments a bettor may propose a bet for the website operator to consider. According to various embodiments a registration number is issued by the website operator if the bet is accepted. According to various embodiments the bettor then proceeds to the land based casino running the website and pays for the registered bet. According to various embodiments by permitting the bettor to make the actual payment for the wager at the land based casino legal issues with Internet betting in the United States are reduced or eliminated. This method is believed to provide convenience to the bettor because the bettor can determine and place their bet s prior to going to the casino. Further such a method may provide additional foot traffic for the casinos to enhance play of their other games as bettors are required to travel to the casino to make payment.

At block E the bettor reviews the available bets on the website. According to some embodiments the website may list all or some of the possible bets that may be made. The possible bets that may be shown may be determined according to the bettor s account or betting profile e.g. possible football bets will not be shown to a bettor not interested in football . Available bets may also be shown based on the historical betting behavior of the bettor.

Odds shown for a possible bet may be set or may be variable depending upon when the bet is registered or when the bet is paid for. For example a bet on the winner of the Major League Baseball World Series may have 6 1 odds after the regular season and before the baseball playoffs start 1 1 odds just before the World Series starts and 1 4 odds after the third game of the Series. For this example the odds of the registered bet may be determined at the time the bet is registered or at the time the bet is paid for. If the odds for a registered bet are determined at the time the bet is registered the land based casino may require payment for the registered bet within a specified time period e.g. one minute one hour one day one week one month etc. and this specified time period may shorten as the sports or other event approaches.

At block E the bettor determines the bet s to make and at block E the bettor registers the bet s . For instance the bets may be registered on a website e.g. through a communication network including the Internet cellular network etc. . The bettor may make a bet listed on the website. Alternatively or in addition to the offered bets that are listed the player may propose a bet not on the website. For instance in the case where a bet is not listed on the website the bettor may state the specific event that is being bet on and the bettor or the website operator may determine the odds to be given to the bettor for the bet.

When the website operator accepts the bet the website may provide a registration transaction or confirmation number to the bettor for the bet s at block E. The bettor then proceeds to the land based casino at block E for payment. For instance the bettor may proceed to a cashier a kiosk or other means available for paying for the bet s at the casino or other legal gambling jurisdiction. At block E the bettor provides the bet registration number to the casino the casino confirms the registration number at block E. At block E the bettor pays the casino for the bet s and the bettor may obtain a betting slip showing the bet s placed and the odds on the bet s .

At block E the event is held that determines the outcome of the bet and the casino determines if the bettor is a winner at block E. If the bettor is a winner the casino then pays out the winnings to the bettor at block E. To receive the winnings a bettor may be required to return to the casino.

At block E it is possible that the bettor may need to make more picks on the same bet. For example a bettor may need to make more picks for second and other additional rounds of a multiple round tournament based upon the previous round s results. Such a tournament may include for example the FIFA World Cup in soccer or the NCAA Men s Basketball Championship. In such a tournament it is possible that a bettor may need to make all picks for all rounds before placing the bet.

When paying for a registered bet a bettor may pay for instance using money loyalty points combination thereof or any other payment method. In particular a bettor may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively or in addition to other payment methods a bettor may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The bettor may pay in person e.g. by using a cashier or by other methods within the casino including telephone handheld device or kiosk. Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction.

The computer system or game operator may automatically determine when a bettor is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance the computer system may then notify the bettor that he or she has won and what the winnings are. Notification of winning to a bettor may occur by mail e mail computer web or network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other method.

After a winner is authenticated and verified the computer system may then notify all bettors of the win. Additionally the computer system may display the winning bet the bettor s identity or the payout.

A bettor may also be able to replay or review past bets using an audio enabled or video enabled device. For instance a kiosk telephone having a display television computer or handheld device may be used to view past bets. By accessing a selected bet in the computer system a game player may be able to see the event outcome the bet odds and the payout.

In one embodiment a computer system may be used to operate most acts of the betting operation including taking registering and paying out bets. For instance computer system s used to perform betting functions according to one embodiment may include single or multiple computer systems one or more of which may include a supercomputer a minicomputer a mainframe computer or a personal computer. A computer system used to run the betting operation may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system level tasks. Multiple computer systems may also be used to run one or more betting operations. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays or storage units to facilitate the betting operation. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used and various embodiments are not limited to any number type or configuration of computer systems.

A computer system e.g. system E that executes the betting operation according to various embodiments may include for example one or more component systems e.g. systems E E and or E as shown in . One system component e.g. payment system E may handle payment by bettors. Another system component e.g. sports betting system E may handle taking and registering bets for one or more events including sporting event. Yet another system e.g. payout system E may handle making payouts to players. Such a betting system may also be connected e.g. by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing gambling floor kiosks or other systems. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A payment component e.g. system E may include one or more of a number of well known systems. For example a bettor may be able to pay for a bet through a casino cashier kiosk or other means that is connected to the payment computer system through an interface. In the computer data may be stored in a database that is stored in the memory of a computer system. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network.

Various embodiments may provide a means for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a sequence of random events used in an online casino game.

Various embodiments may provide a method of using a pre generated sequence of random events to play an online casino game.

Various embodiments may provide a method of sending a pre generated sequence of random events to a user in an encrypted and or digested form so that the user cannot forecast the sequence of random events in the online casino game.

Various embodiments may provide a method for providing the user with an encryption key and the original random events sequence at the end of a game session to decrypt and verify the pre generated random events sequence by comparing the stored random events sequence with the original random events sequence and thereby authenticate the random events sequence used in the online casino game.

Various embodiments may provide a method of sending a pre generated sequence of random events to a user so that the user may reassemble the random events after a game session is completed.

Various embodiments provide a method of authenticating a pre generated random events sequence in an online casino game. In a preferred embodiment a user establishes communication with an online casino to request a game session. The user requests a game to play on the online casino from a list of available games such as blackjack roulette craps etc. Once the user completes the selection of the game the online casino receives the request and initiates the game session. For each game there is a certain number and type of estimated random events that will be required to play the game session to completion or end the game session at the discretion of the user. Each random event represents an action that would occur at a real casino such as drawing a card or rolling dice. The online casino is equipped with a random number generator which pre generates an estimated number of random events and places the random events into a random events sequence. The random events sequence is coded into an encrypted sequence and then transmitted to the user who stores the encrypted sequence until a game verification stage. For the step of encoding the random events sequence may also be converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user or first encrypted and then converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user.

At this stage in the game session the user cannot interpret the pre generated encrypted random events sequence the user receives from the online casino and the online casino does not have to be concerned about the user being able to unfairly forecast the sequence of random events in the future. The user then commences playing the specified game by requesting random events from the online casino. The online casino receives these requests from the user and responds by sending the user the next number drawn sequentially from the pre generated random events sequence. Events from the random sequence are consumed by the online casino during the game session. The user records all random events received from the online casino. Once the number of random events in the pre generated sequence have been exhausted or the user indicates an intent to terminate the game session the online casino communicates a Game is Over to the user and the game ends.

The online casino then sends the user an encryption key for game verification to prove the integrity of the game. The encryption key allows the user to decode the encrypted random events sequence that was previously transmitted to the user at the beginning of the game session. The user decodes the encrypted random events sequence and the decoded random events sequence is compared to the record the user kept of the random events sequence sent by the online casino. If the sequences are identical then the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with by the online casino during the game session. If the random event sequence recorded by the user and the random events sequence presented by the online casino are different the verification fails. The user then communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.

The game session may also be played with more than one user. The online casino may send the same encrypted sequence which is pre generated to each participant allowing them to recompile their individual random events sequences into the original pre generated random events sequences and compare it with the random events sequences sent by the online casino for verification purposes.

Various embodiments will now be described with reference to which in general disclose a method for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of online games and more specifically a method of authenticating a pre generated random events sequence in an online casino game.

Referring to in a preferred embodiment a user establishes communication with an online casino F to request a game session which is the equivalent of one game in an actual casino. The user possesses the necessary computer client game software and any other basic materials and hardware needed to establish communication with the online casino. The online casino may be a single computer acting as a game server or several computers where databases and processors are in different locations. The user requests a game to play on the online casino during the game session by selecting from a list of available games. A list of typical games to play during the game session may include one of the following games blackjack roulette craps baccarat slot machine lottery sports betting and poker. It is understood that various embodiments are not limited to these games and may include games not included in the above list.

Once the user completes the selection of the game and communicates the game selected to the online casino the online casino receives the request and initiates the game session F. For each game there is a certain number and type of estimated random events that will be required to play the game session to completion or end the game session at the discretion of the user. Each random event represents an action that would occur at a real casino such as drawing a card or rolling dice. For example in the game of blackjack the type of random events which occur during the game is the action of drawing cards. The number of random events in one game session will typically not exceed 10 000 events. Events from the random sequence are consumed by the online casino during the game session. The online casino is equipped with a random number generator which pre generates the random events F.

The online casino generates an estimated number of random events and places the random events into a random events sequence F which is a set of random events generated for the game session. The random events sequence is coded into an encrypted sequence F and then transmitted to the user F who stores the encrypted sequence until a game verification stage. The method used to encrypt the random events sequence may be any well known encryption method used in the art. As shown in respectively for the step of encoding the random events sequence may also be converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user or first encrypted and then converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user as described below.

Referring again to at this stage in the game session the user cannot interpret the pre generated encrypted sequence and the online casino does not have to be concerned about the user unfairly predicting the sequence of random events in the future. The user then commences playing the specified game F by requesting random events from the online casino. The online casino receives these requests from the user and responds by sending the user the next number drawn sequentially from the pre generated random events sequence. The user records all random events F received from the online casino. It is understood that the user may record the random events manually as a function of the client game software or other well know methods for recording. Once the number of random events in the pre generated sequence have been exhausted or the user indicates an intent to terminate the game session the online casino communicates a Game is Over to the user and the game ends F.

The online casino then sends the user an encryption key F for game verification to prove the integrity of the game. The encryption key allows the user to decode the encrypted random events sequence that was transmitted to the user at the beginning of the game session. The user decodes the encrypted random events sequence F and the decoded random events sequence is compared to the record F the user kept of the random events sequence sent by the online casino at the commencement of the game session. It is understood that the user may compare the record the random events manually as a function of the client game software or other well know methods for recording. If the sequences are identical then the game was fair F and the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with during the game session. If the verification fails the user communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.

As shown in the online casino may also encode the pre generated random events sequence using a digital digest at the encoding step. The online casino converts the random events sequence into the digital digest F before transmitting the digital digest to the user F. The specified game is played F. The user records the random events F during the game session. Once the game ends F the online casino sends the user an undigested random events sequence F. The user then verifies the authenticity of the random events sequence F sent by the online casino by converting the undigested random events sequence into the digital digest and comparing this digital digest with the digital digest sent by the casino at the commencement of the game. For the verification to succeed the two digital digests should be identical. Once the random events sequence sent by the online casino is thus verified the user proceeds with verifying the random events sequence F sent by the online casino during the game session by comparing the verified undigested random events sequence sent by the casino at the end of the game with the random events sequences kept by the user. For the verification to succeed the two random events sequences must be identical. Similarly the comparison can be carried out by the user manually or by the client software. If the sequences are identical then the game was fair F and the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with during the game session. If the verification fails the user communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.

Referring to the online casino may also encode the pre generated random events sequence by first encrypting and then converting the encoded sequence into a digital digest to complete the encoding step. The online casino encrypts the random events sequence and then converts it into the digital digest F before transmitting it to the user F. The specified game is played F. The user records the random events F during the game session. Once the game ends F the online casino transmits to the user an undigested random events sequence in its encrypted form. The online casino also transmits to the user an encryption key F. The user first authenticates the encrypted random events sequence by converting it into a digital digest and then comparing it to the digital digest F sent at the commencement of the game session. The random events sequence is then decoded F and compared to the record the user kept of the random events sequence sent by the online casino F. The user may carry out the comparison manually or by the client game software. For the verification to succeed the sequences must be identical. If the sequences are identical then the game was fair F and the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with during the game session. If the verification fails the user communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.

Using the above method the user may be confident that the random events sequence was generated without fraudulent action or knowledge of the online casino since the encrypted sequence was pre generated and sent to the user prior to beginning of the game session eliminating any chance for the online casino to modify the sequence of events and thus the game in response to the user s actions or steps during the game session.

Referring to the game session may be played with more than one user F. The online casino may send the same encrypted sequence which is pre generated to each participant i.e. the encrypted sequence represents the same deck of cards . Each user must have access to the sequence of random events received by other users during the game session. At the end of the game session the users then collectively compare the sequence of random events received to the sequence of random events that the online casino transmitted at the beginning of the game session to ensure that the sequence was not altered.

Although embodiments for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of online games are described above it is to be understood that the features described may be used with any electronic game or technology requiring authentication of a random events sequence. Thus the features and embodiments described above are not to be construed as limiting.

Various embodiments relate to a computerized system that facilitates team play of card gaming. The computerized system includes at least a first computer for use by a first participant associated with a first team a second computer for use by a second participant associated with a second team a third computer for use by a third participant associated with the first team and a fourth computer for use by a fourth participant associated with the second team. A computer network links the first and second computers to each other for allowing the first and second participants to compete against each other for team points in a first set of card gaming. Likewise the computer network also links the third and fourth computers to each other for allowing the third and fourth participants to compete against each other for team points in a second set of card gaming. A central server computer coupled to the computer network coordinates the first second third and fourth computers and tallies together team points earned by participants of each team to compute an overall team score for each team. Preferably the central server computer also computes the team points earned individually by each of the first second third and fourth participants. The aforementioned computer network may be in the form of a local area network assuming that the aforementioned computers are located relatively close to each other as within a casino. Alternatively the aforementioned computer network may be the internet in the case wherein one or more of such computers are located remotely from the others.

Further it will be understood that additional components may be used in the communication of information between the users and the gaming server. Such additional components may include without limitation lines trunks antennas switches cables transmitters receivers computers routers servers fiber optical transmission equipment repeaters amplifiers etc.

In some embodiments the communication of gaming information takes place without involvement of the Internet. However in some embodiments a portion of the gaming information may be transmitted over the Internet. Also some or all of the gaming information may be transmitted partially over an Internet communications path. In some embodiments some information is transmitted entirely or partially over the Internet but the information is either not gaming information or is gaming information that does not need to be maintained secretly. For instance data that causes a graphical representation of a table game on the user s gaming communication device might be transmitted at least partially over the Internet while wagering information transmitted by the user might be transmitted entirely over a non Internet communications network.

According to some embodiments as shown in for example the communications network comprises a cellular network . Cellular network comprises a plurality of base stations each of which has a corresponding coverage area . Base station technology is generally known and the base stations may be of any type found in a typical cellular network. The base stations may have coverage areas that overlap. Further the coverage areas may be sectorized or non sectorized. The network also includes mobile stations which function as the gaming communication devices used by users to access the gaming system and participate in the activities available on the gaming system. Users are connected to the network of base stations via transmission and reception of radio signals. The communications network also includes at least one voice data switch which may be connected to the wireless portion of the network via a dedicated secure landline. The communications network may also include a gaming service provider which is likewise connected to the voice data switch via a dedicated secure landline. The voice data switch may be connected to the wireless network of base stations via a mobile switching center MSC for example and the landline may be provided between the voice data switch and the MSC.

Users access the gaming system by way of mobile stations which are in communication with and thus part of the communications network. The mobile station may be any electronic communication device that is operable in connection with the network as described. For example in this particular embodiment the mobile station may comprise a cellular telephone.

In various embodiments in the case of a cellular network for example the gaming system is enabled through the use of a private label carrier network. Each base station is programmed by the cellular carrier to send and receive private secure voice and or data transmissions to and from mobile station handsets. The handsets may be pre programmed with both gaming software and the carrier s authentication software. The base stations communicate via private T1 lines to a switch. A gaming service provider leases a private T1 or T3 line which routes the calls back to gaming servers controlled by the gaming service provider. Encryption can be installed on the telephones if required by a gaming regulation authority such as a gaming commission.

The cellular network may be a private closed system. Mobile stations communicate with base stations and base stations are connected to a centralized switch located within a gaming jurisdiction. At the switch voice calls are transported either locally or via long distance. Specific service provider gaming traffic is transported from the central switch to a gaming server at a host location which can be a casino or other location.

As subscribers launch their specific gaming application the handset will only talk to certain base stations with cells or sectors that have been engineered to be wholly within the gaming jurisdiction. For example if a base station is close enough to pick up or send a signal across state lines it will not be able to communicate with the device. When a customer uses the device for gaming the system may prohibit if desired the making or receiving voice calls. Moreover voice can be eliminated entirely if required. Further the devices may not be allowed to connect to the Internet. This ensures a high level of certainty that bets wagers originate and terminate within the boundaries of the gaming jurisdiction and the private wireless system cannot be circumvented or bypassed. Although in some embodiments some data and or voice traffic may be communicated at least partially over the Internet the communication path may not include the Internet in other embodiments. Alternatively in some embodiments certain non gaming information may be transported over a path which includes the Internet while other information relating to the gaming activities of the system is transported on a path that does not include the Internet.

As shown in a gaming communication device is in communication with a gaming service provider over a network . The gaming service provider preferably has one or more servers on which are resident various gaming and other applications. As shown in some example gaming applications include horse racing and other sports financial exchange casino and or virtual casino entertainment and other events exchange and news and real time entertainment. Each of these applications may be embodied in one or more software modules. The applications may be combined in any possible combination. Additionally it should be understood that these applications are not exhaustive and that other applications may exist to provide an environment to the user that is associated with any of the described or potential activities.

In another embodiment as shown in for example the communications network comprises a private wireless network. The private wireless network may include for example an 802.11x WiFi network technology to cover Game Spots or Entertainment Spots. In various WiFi networks are indicated as networks . Networks may use other communications protocols to provide a private wireless network including but not limited to 802.16x WiMax technology. Further networks may be interconnected. Also a gaming system may comprise a combination of networks as depicted in . For example there is shown a combination of private wireless networks a cellular network comprising a multi channel access unit or sectorized base station and a satellite network comprising one or more satellites .

With respect to the private wireless network because the technology may cover small areas and provide very high speed throughput the private wireless network is particularly well suited for gaming commission needs of location and identity verification for the gaming service provider products. The gaming spots enabled by networks may include a current casino area new areas such as swimming pools lakes or other recreational areas guest rooms and restaurants such as might be found in casino or hotels and residential areas and other remote gaming areas . The configuration of the overall gaming system depicted in is intended only as an example and may be modified to suit various embodiments.

 b at least two layers of user authentication that provided by the mobile carrier and that provided by the gaming service provider 

Each of the Game Spots or Entertainment Spots is preferably connected via the MWAN MAN back to central and redundant game servers. For accessing the private wireless networks the gaming communication devices may be WiFi or WiMax enabled PDAs or mini laptops and do not have to be managed by a third party partner.

In various embodiments the gaming system includes a location verification feature which is operable to permit or disable gaming from a remote location depending upon whether or not the location meets one or more criteria. A criterion may be for example whether the location is within a pre defined area in which gaming is permitted by law. As another example a criterion may be whether the location is in a no gaming zone such as a school. The location verification technology used in the system may include without limitation network based and or satellite based technology. Network based technology may include such technologies as multilateration triangulation and geo fencing for example. Satellite based technologies may include global positioning satellite GPS technology for example.

As previously discussed the cellular approach preferably includes the use of at least one cellular mobile voice and data network. For gaming in certain jurisdictions such as Nevada for example the technology may involve triangulation global positioning satellite GPS technology and or geo fencing to avoid the potential for bets or wagers to be made outside Nevada state lines. In some embodiments the network would not cover all of a particular jurisdiction such as Nevada. For instance the network would not cover areas in which cellular coverage for a particular base station straddled the state line or other boundary of the jurisdiction. This is done in order to permit the use of location verification to insure against the chance of bets originating or terminating outside of the state. Triangulation may be used as a method for preventing gaming from unapproved locations. Triangulation may be accomplished for example by comparing the signal strength from a single mobile station received at multiple base stations each having GPS coordinates. This technology may be used to pinpoint the location of a mobile station. The location can then be compared to a map or other resource to determine whether the user of the mobile station is in an unapproved area such as a school. Alternatively GPS technology may be used for these purposes.

As shown in the gaming system includes a plurality of gaming communication devices and . Device is located outside the gaming jurisdiction . Devices and are both located inside gaming jurisdiction . However only device is located within geo fence which is established by the coverage areas of a plurality of base station . Thus geo fencing may be used to enable gaming via device but disable gaming via devices and . Even though some gaming communication devices that are within the gaming jurisdiction such as device are not permitted access to the gaming system the geo fence ensures that no gaming communication devices outside jurisdiction such as device are permitted access.

Geo fencing may not specify location. Rather it may ensure that a mobile station is within certain boundaries. For instance geo fencing may be used to ensure that a mobile station beyond state lines does not access the gaming system. Triangulation on the other hand may specify a pinpoint or near pinpoint location. For example as shown in device is triangulated between three of the base stations to determine the location of device . Triangulation may be used to identify whether a device such as a mobile station is located in a specific spot where gambling is unauthorized such as for example a school . Preferably the location determination technology utilized in conjunction with various embodiments meets the Federal Communication Commission s FCC s Phase 2 E911 requirements. Geological Institute Survey GIS mapping may also be utilized to compare identified coordinates of a gaming communication device with GIS map features or elements to determine whether a device is in an area not authorized for gaming. It should be noted that any type of location verification may be used such as triangulation geo fencing global positioning satellite GPS technology or any other type of location determining technology which can be used to ensure or provide an acceptable level of confidence that the user is within an approved gaming area.

In various embodiments location verification is accomplished using channel address checking or location verification using some other identifying number or piece of information indicative of which network or portion of a network is being accessed by the gaming communication device. Assuming the usage of an identifying number for this purpose then according to one method of location checking as an example a participant accesses the gaming system via a mobile telephone. The identifying number of the mobile telephone or of the network component being accessed by the mobile telephone identifies the caller s connection to the mobile network. The number is indicative of the fact that the caller is in a defined area and is on a certain mobile network. A server application may be resident on the mobile telephone to communicate this information via the network to the gaming service provider. In a some embodiments the identifying number or information is passed from a first network provider to a second network provider. For example a caller s home network may be that provided by the second provider but the caller is roaming on a network and in a jurisdiction provided by the first provider. The first provider passes the identifying information through to the second provider to enable the second provider to determine whether the caller is in a defined area that does or does not allow the relevant gaming activity. In various embodiments the gaming service provider either maintains or has access to a database that maps the various possible worldwide mobile network identifying numbers to geographic areas. Various embodiments contemplate using any number or proxy that indicates a network portion of a network or network component which is being connected with a mobile telephone. The identifying number may indicate one or more of a base station or group of base stations a line a channel a trunk a switch a router a repeater etc.

In various embodiments when the user connects his mobile telephone to the gaming server the gaming server draws the network identifying information and communicates that information to the gaming service provider. The software resident on the gaming communication device may incorporate functionality that will upon login or access by the user determine the user s location based at least in part on the identifying information and send a message to the gaming service provider. The identifying number or information used to determine location may be country specific state specific town specific or specific to some other definable boundaries.

In connection with any of the location determination methods the gaming system may periodically update the location determination information. This may be done for example during a gaming session at pre defined time intervals to ensure that movement of the gaming communication device to an unauthorized area is detected during play and not just upon login or initial access.

Thus depending on the location determination technology being used the decision whether to permit or prohibit a gaming activity may be made at the gaming communication device at the gaming server or at any of the components of the telecommunication network being used to transmit information between the gaming communication device and the gaming server such as at a base station for example .

An aspect of the private wireless network related to preventing gaming in unauthorized areas is the placement of sensors such as Radio Frequency Identification RFID sensors on the gaming communication devices. The sensors trigger alarms if users take the devices outside the approved gaming areas. Further the devices may be tethered to immovable objects. Users might simply log in to such devices using their ID and password.

In various embodiments a gaming system may include the ability to determine the location of the gaming communication device within a larger property such as a casino complex. This may allow certain functionalities of the device to be enabled or disabled based upon the location of the device within the property. For example government regulations may prohibit using the device to gamble from the guest rooms of a casino complex. Therefore particular embodiments may include the ability to determine the location of the device within the property and then disable the gambling functionality of the device from a guest room or other area where gambling is prohibited. illustrates an example of a wireless gaming system in which the location of a gaming communication device may be determined in accordance various embodiments.

As shown in a wireless gaming system comprises a wireless network that at least partially covers casino complex in which one or more gaming communication devices may be used to participate in a variety of gaming activities. The wireless network may comprise at least three signal detection devices although various embodiments may include fewer or greater than three signal detection devices. As shown in the wireless network comprises four signal detection devices each located at one corner of casino complex . In various embodiments these signal detection devices may comprise wireless access points wireless routers wireless base stations satellites or any other suitable signal detection device. Furthermore although signal detection devices are illustrated as being located on the boundaries of casino complex signal detection devices may be located anywhere inside or outside of casino complex provided the signal detection devices are operable to receive signals originating from a gaming communication device inside casino complex . In various embodiments signal detection devices may also be used to transmit as well as receive signals to gaming communication device .

In various embodiments casino complex may be divided into one or more zones which represent different areas of the casino complex such as the lobby guest rooms restaurants shops entertainment venues and pool areas. For example as shown in zone may correspond to the casino lobby zone may correspond to guest rooms zone may correspond to restaurants and zone may correspond to the gaming floor of the casino. Each zone may be further divided into one or more sub zones each specifying a particular location within zone . Sub zones may be arranged in a grid formation each sub zone having a uniform size. In some embodiments each sub zone may comprise 9 square feet i.e. 3 feet by 3 feet . In some embodiments each sub zone may comprise 100 square feet i.e. 10 feet by 10 feet . The choice of the size of an area covered by a sub zone may depend on administrator preferences technical limitations of the wireless network and governmental regulations as well as other considerations.

Particular embodiments may use this mapping of casino complex into a plurality of zones and sub zones to determine the location of gaming communication device within the complex. These embodiments may utilize the signal received by signal detection devices from gaming communication device to determine the location of the device.

In various embodiments the location of gaming communication device may be determined based upon the strength of the signal received by each signal detection device from device . In various embodiments this may be accomplished using a Received Signal Strength Indication RSSI value or any other suitable indication of signal strength. Generally the closer a sub zone is to a signal detection device the stronger the signal the signal detection device will receive from a gaming communication device located in that sub zone. Therefore given a plurality of signal strength readings taken from different points in the casino complex i.e. signal detection devices these different signal strength readings may be used to determine the location of the device.

With this in mind each sub zone of casino complex may be associated with a reference set of signal strengths received by the signal detection devices from a device located in that particular sub zone. Typically these values are generated and periodically recalibrated by taking a reference reading from a gaming communication device located that sub zone. After each sub zone is associated with a reference set of signal strengths these reference signal strengths may be compared with the signal strengths received by the signal detection devices from a gaming communication device. Since each sub zone has a unique set of signal strengths this comparison may be used to identify the particular zone in which the gaming communication device is located.

In various embodiments the location of gaming communication device may be determined based upon an elapsed time between the transmission of the signal from device and the receipt of the signal by each signal detection device . In various embodiments this elapsed time may be determined based on a Time Difference of Arrival TDOA or any other suitable technology. As before in the case of signal strengths each sub zone may be associated with a predetermined or reference set of elapsed times from transmission to receipt of a signal from a gaming communication device. This set of elapsed times will be different for each sub zone of the casino complex as the time it takes a signal to reach each signal detection device will depend on the proximity of the sub zone to each base station. By comparing the time from transmission to receipt of a signal received by the signal detection devices from a gaming communication device the sub zone in which the device is located may be determined.

Once the location of the gaming communication device has been determined particular embodiments may then enable and or disable particular functions of the device based on this determination. For example as mentioned previously particular embodiments may disable the gaming communication device s gambling functionality from a user s guest room while still allowing the user to use other device functions such as purchasing merchandise or services or buying tickets to an entertainment event. Once the user leaves his or her guest room the gambling functionality of the gaming communication device may be enabled. Similarly particular embodiments may prevent the gaming communication device from being used to make financial transactions from the casino floor. Once the user leaves the casino floor such functionality may be enabled. Similarly other functionalities of the gaming communication device may be enabled or disabled based upon the location of the device within the property in accordance with various embodiments.

In various embodiments the various functionalities of the gaming communication device may be enabled or disabled based upon the zone in which the device is located. In such embodiments each zone of the casino complex may be associated with a set of allowed activities. For example the lobby zone of the casino complex may have all activities allowed while the guest room zone of the property may have all activities allowed except gambling. Based upon the gaming communication device s location the functionality of the gaming communication device may be limited to the set of allowed activities for the zone in which the device is located. As the gaming communication device travels from zone to zone the location of the device may be re determined and the functionality of the device may be updated to reflect the set of allowed activities for the zone in which the device is now located.

Various embodiments may also use the location determination to send location specific information to the gaming communication device. For example a reminder that an entertainment event to which the user has tickets is about to begin may be sent to the user s device if the device and therefore the user is located in a different part of the casino complex. In another embodiment a user may be alerted that the user s favorite dealer is on the casino floor if the user is located in his or her guest room.

In various embodiments the location of the gaming communication device may be used to deliver goods and services purchased or ordered by the user of the device. For example in various embodiments the user may purchase food and beverages using the device. The location of the device may then be used to deliver the food and beverages to the user even if the user relocates to another sub zone after placing his or her order.

The determination of the gaming communication device s location may also be used to provide the user with directions to another part of the casino complex. For example a user that is located on the casino floor that wishes to go to a specific restaurant within the complex may be given direction based upon his or her location. These directions may then be updated as the user progresses towards his or her desired location. In the event the user gets off course the location determination which may be updated during the user s travel may be used to alert the user that he she has gotten off course and then plot a new course to the desired destination.

It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.

According to various embodiments the wireless gaming system can incorporate a user profile element. One or more user profiles may be created maintained and modified for example on one or more of the servers of the gaming system. Generally the user profiles include information relating to respective users. The information may be maintained in one or more databases. The information may be accessible to the gaming server and or to one or more mobile devices. The devices which may access the information may according to certain embodiments include gaming devices or gaming management devices. Gaming management devices may include wireless devices used by casino staff to provide gaming services or gaming management services.

Various embodiments include software and or hardware to enable the provision modification and maintenance of one or more user profiles. Thus one or more user profiles may each comprise a set of data maintained in a data storage device. The data set s for each respective user profile may reflect any of a number of parameters or pieces of information which relate to the particular user s corresponding to the profile s . Although not intended to be exhaustive such information may include for example gaming activity preferences such as preferred game and or game configuration preferred screen configuration betting preferences gaming location preferences dining and other service preferences and so forth. The information may also include user identity information such as name home address hotel name and room number telephone numbers social security numbers user codes and electronic files of fingerprint voice photograph retina scan or other biometric information. User profile information may also include information relating to the user but not determined by the user or the user s activities. Such information may include any information associated with or made part of a profile. For example an entity such as a casino may include as part of a profile certain rules governing the distribution of promotions or offers to the user. User profile information can include any codes account numbers credit information approvals interfaces applications or any other information which may be associated with a user. Thus user profile information may include any information that is particular to a given user. For example profile information may include the location s at which a particular user has played skill levels success levels types of games played and betting styles and trends of information relating to the user s activities.

In various embodiments user profile information may include concierge or other service information that is associated with a user. Concierge services may include restaurant services entertainment services hotel services money management services or other appropriate services that may be offered to the user of a gaming device. For example restaurant services may include without limitation services that allow the user to order drinks order food make reservations or perform other restaurant related activities. As another example entertainment services may include without limitation services that allow the user to purchase show tickets arrange appointments or services virtually shop arrange transportation or perform other entertainment related activities. Hotel services may include for example services that allow the user to check in check out make spa appointments check messages leave messages review a hotel bill or perform other guest related activities. Money management services may include for example services that allow the user to transfer funds pay bills or perform other money management activities.

The gaming system may be configured to establish a new profile for any user who is using a gaming device for the first time. Alternatively a new profile may be established for a prior user who has not played for a predetermined time period. The gaming system may set up the profile monitor user activities adjust the profile and adjust information such as graphics displayed to the user. The gaming system may be configured to use the profile information to alter the presentation of gaming information to the user. For example if a prior user has returned to the gaming system the system may consult the profile for the user and determine that in the prior session of gaming the user lost money on craps but won money on blackjack. Based on this information the system may adjust the default gaming screen and present a blackjack table for the user. As a further example the profile information may indicate that the majority of the user s prior blackjack time was spent on 25 minimum tables. The system may accordingly make a further adjustment to the gaming environment and make the blackjack table being presented a 25 table. In this sense the gaming system enables personalized wireless gaming based on one or more criteria maintained in a user profile.

The user profiles may be established maintained and periodically updated as necessary to enable a gaming provider to provide an enhanced current and or customized gaming experience. Updates may be undertaken based on any suitable trigger such as the occurrence of an event the occurrence of a user activity or the passage of a certain predetermined time period. Any or all of the profile information may be updated.

In some embodiments the gaming system may be configured to initiate one or more alerts to one or more users based on any number of criteria. For instance an alert may be based on the location of a user. The system may also be configured to keep track of other non location dependent parameters. The initiation of an alert may depend on a time parameter. Gaming alerts can also be based on this and or other information maintained in a user profile. Alerts can be prioritized for presentation and the content and display of the alerts may be customized by the user or another entity. As a related concept the system may be configured to provide directions and or maps. Another related concept involves enabling a user to view a certain activity or area remotely. The alert may be generated in response to the existence of data within a user profile. Additionally the content and presentation of the alert may be determined based on information in the user profile. Thus when the alerts occur and what the alerts indicate may be customized or tailored according to user preferences or any other information maintained about the user e.g. in a user profile .

In some embodiments an alert may be presented or displayed to the user in a format determined at least in part by any of the parameters described or contemplated herein. For example if the user is located outdoors the display may be automatically brightened in order to allow the user to more easily view the alert. The alert may be presented in any one or a combination of textual visual oral or other information exchange formats. Alerts presented to users on the screen of a gaming communication device for example may be configured in any desirable manner. Preferably the information is displayed in a way as to most effectively utilize the screen real estate to convey the alert message. Thus different alerts of differing types or having differing priorities can be displayed differently on the gaming device. For example a more important alert can be displayed as a popup while secondary alerts scroll at the bottom of the screen. The player can register for alerts and determine his own particular alert configuration preferences.

According to some embodiments directional information may be provided to one or more users. The directional information may be associated with an alert. The directional information may be based on any of the parameters described herein e.g. profiles alerts locations changes in play or other activities etc . Directions may be given to activities locations seats tables recreational spots restaurants change cages information booths casinos hotels sports venues theaters etc. For example directions may be given to a particular table or gaming area a casino other than the one where the user is presently located or where another user is located a restaurant that is specified in a user profile a sports book area of a casino a hotel room etc.

The directions can be presented orally textually and or graphically e.g. as map with zoom capabilities . An example of how directions would be provided involves a user profile indicating that the user likes to play high limit blackjack on Saturday nights but that the user does not have a particular casino preference. If the user enters any casino for which the system is operable the system provides the user with an alert inviting the player to the high limit blackjack tables and directional information in the form of a visual route. Another example involves a user leaving a sports book in a casino and the user has indicated that he wants to play craps. The device gives walking directions to the craps tables. Another example involves a user that has a preferred list of dinner restaurants. At a predetermined time e.g. 8 00 pm the system presents the user with the list lets the user make a selection and a reservation. The system then provides the user with verbal directions from the user s current location to the selected restaurant. The system may also be configured to provide ancillary information based at least in part on the alert the profile or the directional information being provided. For example the system may notify a user that the user will need a cab or will need to take the tram or will need a jacket and tie or will need an umbrella etc. depending on where the user is going and the route he is taking.

According to various embodiments the system enables a user to view a certain activity or area remotely. For example cameras or other viewing devices may be disposed throughout a casino property or other relevant area . At kiosks or on the wireless gaming devices users can peek into one or more selected areas to see the activity in the selected area s . For example from the pool a user can tell if the craps tables have changed limits or are filling up with people. From the craps table a user can see if the restaurant or bar is becoming crowded.

According to various embodiments the operation of the alerts module and the alerts methods are integrated with various techniques for managing user profile information. An example of this aspect is that the system may be configured to recognize that a user has certain preferred dealers or stickmen when playing certain casino games. When those dealers or stickmen are on duty and if the user is located in a certain area or within a certain distance an alert may be sent inviting the user to participate in the gaming activity at the particular table where the dealer or stickman is on duty.

Thus when user profile information indicates that a one or more predetermined criteria are met the system may send an alert to the corresponding user or to another user. For example the system may learn that a player is a fan of certain sports teams. The system monitors information about upcoming events that involve those teams and at a predetermined time checks to see if the user has placed a bet on the event s . If not the system invites the user to visit a sports book to make a bet. As another example the system knows a user prefers 10 minimum tables and alerts the user to the opening of a seat at such a table. As another example the alerts can be triggered by information which is not directly related to or associated with the particular user e.g. non user specific information . For instance an alert might be triggered by a certain time or the occurrence of a certain event e.g. the odds given on a certain sports event changing by a certain predetermined amount .

According to various embodiments gaming services may be provided as an application add on to a pre existing communication or data service. Thus gaming service applications may be made available to customers of a pre existing communication or data service. For example customers of a particular wireless telephone or data service may be offered any one or combination of the various gaming service applications discussed herein as an additional feature that is bundled with the telephone or data service. Although this document may refer to the communication service bundled with offered gaming service applications as including pre existing communication services it is recognized that the gaming services applications may be offered and accepted as part of a package with newly activated communications service plan. In still other embodiments the gaming service may be established first and the communication service may be added later.

The gaming service applications bundled with or otherwise offered in conjunction with communication services may be customized to meet the needs of the customers service providers or both. For example a service provider may elect to make certain gaming service applications available to only a subset of the service providers customers. Accordingly not all customers associated with a service provider may be offered gaming services. As an another example of customized gaming service applications a communication service may offer customers a number of gaming service plans which may provide different levels of service. For example certain services such as advertisement services and or promotional services may be free to customers of the communications service. Such levels of service may be customer selected service provider selected or both.

Customers may be billed separately for add on gaming services or in conjunction with the invoice the customer already receives for the pre existing communications service. For instance in certain embodiments gaming services may be billed as an add on in the same way that Caller ID services call waiting services and call messaging services result in fees that are in addition to the basic fees associated with communication services.

According to various embodiments gaming services enable peer to peer wireless gaming. Specifically the system may enable multiple players to participate in the same gaming activity at the same time from dispersed locations. This may be particularly desirable in the case of certain games such as but without limitation horse racing poker and blackjack. The system may also enable a single player to participate in multiple positions with respect to a particular game. For example a user may be permitted to play multiple hands of blackjack. Particular aspects include such features as providing assistance to a user in finding a particular activity. For example a first player may want to play poker at a six person table. The gaming system may be used to identify such a poker table that has a position available for the first user s participation. Additionally or alternatively a first player might want to play poker at the same table as a second player and the system may be configured to assist the first player in finding a game in which the second player is already participating.

Location determination techniques may be incorporated to enable peer to peer gaming or related services. For example a buddy network may be established to track members of a selected group. For example a group of friends might all be in a gambling jurisdiction but be located at various dispersed places within that jurisdiction. The gaming system allows the establishment of a private buddy network of peers for this group of friends. The system enables one or more members of the group to track one or more other members of the group. In various embodiments the system may also allow messages from and to one or more group members. For example the system also allows members to invite other members to participate in certain wireless gaming activities. Additionally or alternatively the system may allow members of the group to bet on the performance of another member of the group who is participating in a virtual or actual game.

Location determination techniques may also be incorporate to establish an alert system. The alert system may be used to invite certain types of players to participate in a gaming activity. Criteria may then be used to identify users of gaming devices that meet the criteria. For example a gaming participant may wish to initiate a gaming activity with other users of gaming devices that qualify as high rollers or high stakes gamers. As other examples a celebrity user may wish to initiate a gaming activity with other celebrities or a senior citizen may wish to initiate a gaming activity with other senior citizens. In each instance the user may identify criteria that may then be used to identify other gaming participants that meet these criteria for the initiation of a peer to peer gaming event.

It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.

In one or more embodiments the portable gaming device includes a plurality of interfaces for changing the configuration of the gaming device or interacting with one or more transaction servers. In some embodiments a login interface is provided for receiving login information regarding a user of the device. In various embodiments the number of interfaces or other functions or features displayed or permitted to be accessed are configured depending upon the user of the device. In the event a gaming representative identifies himself interfaces permitting access to a variety of control functions may be provided. In the event a player identifies themselves such control functions may not be accessible but instead only consumer related functions may be accessible such as game play.

In one or more embodiments the gaming system includes one or more transaction servers such as a food transaction server. Using an interface of the portable gaming device a player or other user may request services from the food transaction server. For example a player may request food drink a restaurant reservation or other service.

One or more embodiments comprise a method of playing a game via a portable gaming device associated with a gaming network. In some embodiments a player obtains a portable gaming device such as by checking out the device from the hostess station of a restaurant or the front desk of a hotel casino. The player provides value to the gaming operator such as a credit card or cash deposit. This value is associated with the server and matched with a ticket number player tracking number or other identifier.

The game device is configured for player play using the login interface. The act of logging in may be performed by the player or the gaming operator. The player next establishes entitlement to obtain services such as the playing of a game by showing the existence of value. In some embodiments the player scans his ticket using the ticket reader of the device. The scanned information is transmitted to the payment transaction server for verifying entitlement of the player to play a game or obtain other services. In the event the entitlement is verified then the player is permitted to engage in the play of a game or request service.

In the event a player wishes to play a game the player indicates such by selecting a particular game using a game play interface. Upon receipt of such an instruction the game server generates game data and transmits it to the personal gaming device. The transmitted data may comprise sound and video data for use by the personal gaming device in presenting the game. The player is allowed to participate in the game by providing input to the game server through the personal gaming device.

Depending on the location of the PGD B in the game playing area B the communication path for the information packets to and from the PGD B may be through one or more wire less communication relays including B and B. For example when the PGD B is located near gaming machine B the communication path for a message from the PGD B to the EZ pay server B may be from the PGD B to the relay B from the relay B to the relay B from the relay B to the transceiver B and from the transceiver B to the EZ pay server B. As the location of the PGD B changes in the game playing area B the communication path between the PGD B and the EZ pay server B may change.

After receiving an EZ pay ticket validation reply from the EZ pay server B the EZ pay ticket may be validated using an appropriate display screen on the PGD B. After cashing out the ticket the game service representative may send a confirmation of the transaction to the EZ pay server B using the PGD B. The transaction history for the PGD B may be stored on the PGD B as well as the EZ pay server B. Next a receipt for the transaction may be printed out. The receipt may be generated from a portable printer carried by the game server representative that may be connected to the PGD B in some manner or the receipt may be generated from a printer B at a fixed location etc.

After providing a number of game services comprising a number of game service transactions to different game players in the game playing area B using the PGD B a game service representative may log off of the PGD B and return it to location for secure storage. For example at the end of a shift the game service representative may check the PGD B at some of the locations the device is unassigned to the particular game service representative and then may be assigned to another game service representative. However before the PGD B is assigned to another game service representative the transaction history stored on the PGD B may be reconciled with a separate transaction history stored on a transaction server such as the EZ pay server B.

The assigning and unassigning of the PGD B to a game service representative and the transaction reconciliation are performed for security and auditing purposes. Another security measure which may be used on the PGD B is a fixed connection time between the PGD B and a transaction server. For example after the PGD B has been assigned to a game service representative and the game service representative has logged on the PGD B the PGD B may establish a connection with one or more transaction servers including the EZ pay server B a server B a server B or a server B. The connection between a transaction server and the PGD B allows the PGD B to send information to the transaction server and receive information from the transaction server. The length of this connection may be fixed such that after a certain amount of time the connection between the PGD B and the transaction server is automatically terminated. To reconnect to the transaction server the login and registration process must be repeated on the PGD B.

A transaction server may provide one or more game service transactions. However the PGD B may connect with multiple transaction servers to obtain different game service transactions. For example server B may be a prize transaction server allowing prize service transactions and server B may be a food transaction server allowing food service transactions. When a game service representative receives a prize service request from a game player the PGD B may be used to contact the prize transaction server B using a wire less communication link between the PGD B and a transceiver B connected to the prize transaction server B. Similarly when a game service representative receives a food service request from a game player the PGD B may be used to contact the food transaction server B using a wire less communication link between the PGD B and a transceiver B connected to the food transaction server B.

The different transaction servers including the servers B B B B may be on separate networks or linked in some manner. For example server B is connected to network B server B is connected to network B server B is connected to network B and server B is connected to network B. In this embodiment a network link B exists between network B and network B. Thus server B may communicate with server B via the network link B. A communication link between different servers may allow the servers to share game service transaction information and allow different communication paths between the PGDs and the transaction servers. Likewise a network link B exists between network B and network B permitting the game server to communicate with the EZ pay server B.

In a step B the transaction information obtained in step B is validated as required. For example when a player attempts to cash out an award ticket the information from the award is validated to ensure the ticket is both genuine e.g. the ticket may be counterfeit and has not already been validated. The validation process may require a number of transfers of information packets between the PGD B and the transaction server. The details of the validation process for an award ticket validation are described with reference to . When the transaction information is valid in a step B a game service transaction is provided. For example a room reservation may be made for a player requesting an accommodation service. A confirmation of the game service transaction may be sent to the transaction server for transaction reconciliation in a step B. In one or more embodiments the method may include the step of generating a receipt regarding the game service transaction.

In a step B after providing the service a game player may request another game service. When a game player requests an additional game service the game service representative returns to step B and selects an appropriate interface for the game service. When a game player does not request an additional service and it is not the end of a shift in a step B the game service representative returns to step B and contacts a new game player. In a step B when a shift has ended the game service representative logs out of the PGD B and checks the device at a secure location so that the PGD may be assigned to a different game service representative. In step B before the PGD B is assigned to a different game service representative a transaction history reconciliation is performed to ensure that the transaction history stored on the PGD is consistent with the transactions previously confirmed with a transaction server during the game service representative s shift. The transaction history on the PGD B may be stored on a removable memory storage device on the PGD. Thus the memory may be removed from the device for transaction reconciliation and replaced with a new memory. Thus the device with the new memory may be assigned to a new game service representative while the transaction history from the previous game service representative assigned to the device is reconciled.

In a step B the CVT B B sends back a reply with context information to the server. As an example the context information may be the time and place when the ticket was issued. The information from the CVT to the server may be sent as one or more data packets according to a communication standard shared by the CVT and server. In a step B after receiving the validation reply from the CVT the server marks the pay request pending and sends a pay order to the PGD B. While the pay request is pending the server will not allow another ticket with the same information as the ticket with the pay request pending to be validated.

In a step B the game service representative may choose to accept or reject the pay order form the server. When the game service representative accepts the pay order from the server in a step B the PGD B sends a reply to the transaction server confirming that the transaction has been performed. The transaction server marks the request paid which prevents another ticket with identical information from being validated. In a step B the server sends a confirmation to the CVT which allows the CVT to mark the request from pending to paid. When the game service representative rejects the pay order from the server in a step B the PGD B sends a reply to the server to mark the pay request from pending to unpaid. When the ticket is marked unpaid it may be validated by another PGD B or other validation device. In a step B the server sends the reply to the CVT to mark the pay request from pending to unpaid which allows the ticket to be validated.

In one or more embodiments a ticket may be used to provide credit value for establishing entitlement to a service or a good such as the right to play a game or obtain food. The PGD B may include a card reader B. In such an arrangement a user of the PGD B may use a credit card or other magnetic stripe type card for providing credit value. In various embodiments the PGD B may include one or more other types of devices for obtaining receiving information such as a smart card reader. In such arrangements the PGD B device may read information from the credit card smart card or other device. These cards may comprise the well known credit or debit cards. This information may be used to provide the credit value. In the example of a credit card the user s account information may be read from the card and transmitted from the PGD B to the controller B. Credit card credit validation information may be associated with a credit card server not shown . This credit card server may be associated with a bank or other entity remote from the casino or place of use of the PGD B and the controller B. A communication link may be provided between the controller B and remote server for sending credit card information there over.

In some embodiments when a player utilizes a smart card or credit card the amount of associated credit or value may be transmitted to the EZ Pay server B and then the credited amount may be treated in exactly the same manner as if the credit value had been provided by a ticket. When a player wishes to cash out the EZ Pay server B has a record of the original amount credited and the amounts of any awards losses or payments and may then issue the player a ticket representing the user s total credit.

In accordance with various embodiments a gaming system is provided which includes one or more portable gaming devices. The portable gaming devices permit a player to play one or more games at a variety of locations such as a hotel room restaurant or other location. These locations may be remote from traditional gaming areas where free standing generally stationary gaming machines are located.

In one or more embodiments a player may use the portable gaming device to not only play games but obtain other products and services. In addition in one or more embodiments the portable gaming device may be used by game service representatives to perform a variety of functions and provide a variety of services to a player.

It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.

According to various embodiments a wireless interactive gaming system includes one or more wireless gaming devices a receiver and a central processor. The wireless interactive gaming system may also include a terminal which is in communication with the central processor.

In a gaming environment that employs a wireless interactive gaming system a player may receive a wireless gaming device from a game official who represents a gaming establishment or the house . The wireless gaming device is capable of receiving wager information as commands entered by the player and transmitting the received wager information along with identification information to the receiver by wireless transmission.

The wireless interactive gaming system may support a number of wireless gaming devices within one gaming establishment. In some embodiments the range for the wireless transmission from a wireless gaming device may be up to 100 feet. In other embodiments the range may be any desired distance.

According to various embodiments a player inputs information into a wireless gaming device e.g. by pressing push buttons or keys on the device. The wireless gaming device may include any number e.g. from 5 to 20 of buttons in a keypad type arrangement. Buttons may be marked with the digits 0 through 9 and may also include a dollar sign key and an enter key so that the player may easily input wager information. In various embodiments the wireless gaming device includes at least eight player selection buttons e.g. digits and at least five special function buttons e.g. to request the player s balance . In various embodiments the player can input some or all of the wager information into the wireless gaming device by swiping a smart card which contains a microprocessor chip or a magnetic stripe with encoded information through a smart card reader on the wireless gaming device.

In various embodiments the wireless gaming device may include an identifier. The identifier may be e.g. a series of alphanumeric characters a bar code or a magnetic stripe affixed to the device. In various embodiments the identifier may be a digital code stored in a secure memory e.g. an electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM . The identifier may thus be readable directly by the game official if it is a series of alphanumeric characters or it may be read automatically by a bar code reader or a magnetic stripe reader. In various embodiments the identifier may be programmed in EEPROM or read from EEPROM through an RS 232 port which may be directly connected to encoder and decoder circuitry in a terminal.

A wireless gaming device may store an encryption key. The encryption key may be used to encrypt information that is transmitted to the receiver from the device. Encryption of the information transmitted to the receiver may limit tampering with the wireless gaming device and may prevent unauthorized or counterfeit devices from being used with the system.

In various embodiments the encryption key may be stored in the EEPROM. The EEPROM may have the advantage of being a memory device which is difficult to access if the appropriate encoding circuitry is not available. Thus it is contemplated that the encoding circuitry that downloads the encryption key into the device may be securely held by the game official.

Alternately the encryption key stored in the EEPROM may be updated and changed for each player who receives a wireless gaming device by directly connecting the device to encoding and decoding circuitry in the terminal through a port at the time the wireless gaming device is delivered to the player. Moreover other digital information related to the game being played may be downloaded from the terminal to the EEPROM through a direct connection with the wireless gaming device.

In various embodiments a microprocessor controls the operation of a wireless gaming device. The microprocessor receives digital wager information entered by the player using buttons or keys of the wireless gaming device. The microprocessor stores an identification code associated with the wireless gaming device that is a digital equivalent of the identifier of the wireless gaming device. The microprocessor also executes software applications for encrypting the identification code and the player s wager information for transmission to the receiver. The software contains an algorithm that encrypts a data packet including the identification code and wager information using the encryption key.

In various embodiments a wireless gaming device has a unique address i.e. identification code for communications with the receiver and stores a player identification that is programmed into the device by the central processor. The wireless gaming device may include a wager amount register which is maintained and updated using the keys on the device. The value stored in the wager amount register may be included in transmissions from the device to the central processor. The value of the wager amount register may default to a predetermined value e.g. 1 when the device is initialized and can be further adjusted by the player. The wireless gaming device may also include an account balance register which is maintained in the device and is updated by the central processor periodically. The value of the account balance register should default to 0 when the device is initialized.

The wireless gaming device may include player function keys. The player function keys may be used to accomplish the following functions 

The firmware of the wireless gaming device may only allow for one press of buttons or keys every 100 ms. In various embodiments key presses are not queued thus when a key press message is queued to be sent no other player input is accepted until the queued message has been sent.

The wireless gaming device may include a transmitter. The transmitter may receive encrypted digital information from the microprocessor and convert it to a signal for wireless transmission to the receiver. The transmitter transmits signals wirelessly e.g. using radio frequency signals or infrared signals. Communications between the receiver and the wireless gaming device may be asynchronous at 2400 bits per second.

The wireless gaming device may include an identifying circuit that drives the transmitter to periodically send an identification signal to the receiver. The use of the identifying circuit permits the receiver and the central processor to be assured that the wireless gaming device is still active functioning and present in the gaming establishment. Thus if the wireless gaming device were removed from the gaming establishment the receiver and central processor would no longer receive and detect the periodic identification signal sent by the identifying circuit and the transmitter and the game official may be alerted that the wireless gaming device has been removed from the gaming establishment.

The wireless gaming device may contain a real time clock that permits the microprocessor to monitor the current time and date. The clock may consist of a timing circuit. The microprocessor can use the time and date information obtained from clock to perform calculations and other functions based on the current time and date.

The wireless gaming device may also include a tag such as an electronic or magnetic component which activates an alarm when passed through a sensing apparatus located at the entrance and or exit of the gaming establishment. Activation of the alarm by passing the wireless gaming device with the tag through the sensing apparatus notifies the game official of an attempted removal of the wireless gaming device from the gaming establishment.

The wireless gaming device may be powered by a battery source contained within the device. A portable power source such as battery source permits extended cordless operation of the wireless gaming device throughout a gaming environment. The battery source may be part of a removable rechargeable battery pack that allows the device to be recharged when it is not in use.

In some embodiments the wireless gaming device displays information such as game information on a device display such as a liquid crystal display LCD with a back light. The LCD can be used to display the values stored in the wager amount register and in the account balance register. The wireless gaming device may include a display receiver which receives digital information transmitted from the receiver or from the central processor.

The device may also include a bicolor light emitting diode LED and or multiple differently colored LEDs. The bicolor LED is capable of displaying at least two colors e.g. red and green. The green light may flash each time the wireless gaming device sends a transmission to the receiver for a period of time to ensure that it is visible to the player. The red light may illuminate when a key is pressed on the wireless gaming device and remain lit until the transmission is received by the receiver no additional key entry will be enabled when the red light is lit. The wireless gaming device may also include additional light emitting diodes for example to indicate when the account balance register is being updated and the balance information is being displayed on the LCD.

The receiver is capable of receiving signals transmitted from the transmitter in the wireless gaming device. The receiver contains a decoder which converts the received signals e.g. into digital information. This digital information contains at least the identification code of the wireless gaming device and the player s wager information. The receiver sends the digital information obtained by the decoder to the central processor. Communications between the central processor and the receiver may be by an RS 232 electrical interface data serial communications link with communications being asynchronous at either 9600 or 19 200 bytes per second in various embodiments.

The receiver may receive signals from many wireless devices either simultaneously or in rapid succession e.g. using multiplexing techniques so that many players can place wagers using their wireless gaming devices during a short time interval. The receiver differentiates signals received from the various devices by the identification codes which are present in the signals received by the receiver.

The central processor receives the identification code of a wireless gaming device and the player s wager information from the receiver. The central processor also decrypts this information using the encryption key. The central processor is capable of receiving data from multiple wireless gaming devices in an apparently simultaneous manner.

In various embodiments an account for the player is stored in a database of the central processor. The database stores the monetary value of the balance of the account associated with the identifier of the wireless gaming device.

The central processor manages the player s account in the database based on signals received from the player s wireless gaming device as the player places wagers and when prizes are awarded during play of the game. The central processor subtracts money from the player s account balance when the player places a wager. The player s account balance may be automatically increased by the central processor when the player wins a game on which he has placed a wager.

The central processor also stores and is capable of executing software applications containing algorithms to calculate players account balances wagers and winnings. The central processor should be able to execute all of the algorithms which define the actions performed on the players accounts during the progress of the game as wagers are entered as winnings paid out and when funds are added to the players accounts.

Algorithms in the software in the central processor may also calculate odds and payouts for certain games such as lottery type games during play of the game. The odds and payouts at a particular point in time may depend on the characteristics of the game being conducted by the central processor and may change as the game progresses. These algorithms may be executed by the central processor to provide exact calculations of the odds of specific game events occurring and the associated prizes for a player s correctly predicting the occurrence of one of those events. The algorithms may be executed continuously so that real time odds and payout can be calculated as the game progresses.

The central processor may perform various actions on players accounts resulting in various impacts on the accounts. For example if the player wins a game his account is credited for the payout based on his wager. If the player places a wager using the wireless gaming device his account is debited by the amount of the wager. If the game official receives additional funds from the player the balance of the player s account is credited by the amount of the funds. If the game official closes the player s account and disburses funds to him the balance of the player s account is debited by the amount disbursed.

The central processor may be located in the gaming establishment that houses the receiver. In various embodiments the central processor may be located remotely from the receiver communicating with the receiver via electronic digital telephone communication or wireless transmission such as a serial communication link. Additionally the central processor may perform a multitude of functions for various receivers in a variety of gaming environments.

In some embodiments communication among the central processor the receiver and the wireless gaming device involves a polling scheme. Polling enables many wireless gaming devices to communicate with a receiver without interference between them. Such a polling scheme may include the transmission of digital signals in the form of strings of hexadecimal characters. Preferably all communications between the central processor the receiver and the wireless gaming device are encrypted.

In such a polling scheme hexadecimal characters may be reserved for specific control protocols. For example an attention character is a header character used to begin all transmissions from the central processor to the receiver and serves to delineate messages and synchronize the receipt of messages in the receiver. The same function is implied when the attention character follows in response to a message transmission. An acknowledgement character is another header character which provides acknowledgement to the transmitting device that the previous message s data has been received and verified. The acknowledgement character can also function as an attention character to begin a subsequent message. An end of message character is used to indicate the end of a transmission. Also a complement next byte character allows for use of reserved protocol characters within a normal transmission message by avoiding a false control signal when a message data byte matches one of the control characters. When a message byte that needs to be sent matches one of the protocol control characters the complement next byte character is sent followed by the one s complement of the matching message byte.

Verification of received data may be accomplished using a single byte checksum of the message information. This checksum may be the one s complement of the sum of the original message data not including the header character. If the checksum results in a value equal to one of the protocol control characters it will be treated in accordance with the function of the complement next byte character.

In the polling scheme described above there are three different modes of communication over the link between the central processor and the receiver. First the central processor may send messages intended for the receiver. Second the central processor may send messages intended for the wireless gaming device. Third the wireless gaming device may send messages intended for the central processor. In various embodiments messages sent by the central processor may be in the form of a character string formatted with a header character followed by the identification code of the intended device the command or message an end of message character and a checksum character. Messages received by the receiver or the wireless gaming device may be acknowledged by transmission of an acknowledgement character but the central processor need not acknowledge messages sent from the wireless gaming devices. Messages sent by the central processor to be received by the wireless gaming device may be broadcast to all of the wireless gaming devices. A device address may be reserved as a broadcast address for all of the wireless gaming devices and all devices will receive messages sent to this address in this case no acknowledgement need be returned from any of the wireless gaming devices.

Each command or message may begin with a command code to signal how the information contained in the message is to be used. Command codes for messages sent by the central processor to the receiver and the wireless gaming device include the following 

In various embodiments messages sent between the receiver and the wireless gaming device may be in the form of a character string formatted with a header character followed by the identification code of the intended device the current wager amount the request command or data an end of message character and a checksum character. Command codes for requests commands and data sent between the receiver and the wireless gaming device include the following 

These command codes may be used to program the device addresses and user identification information into the wireless gaming devices as well as to initialize the device to the default state i.e. the player s account balance of 0. The account balance register and the user identification may each comprise two characters the least significant byte and the most significant byte allowing for the use a greater range of numbers for these values.

Various embodiments include methods by which the central processor communicates with a wireless gaming device. The central processor transmits a string of hexadecimal characters including e.g. a header character followed by the device s identification code followed by a request command or data followed by an end of message character followed by a checksum character. After the central processor transmits the character string the wireless gaming device receives the string recognizes its identification code and executes any instructions in the string. When the central processor sends an instruction to all wireless gaming devices simultaneously all currently active devices receive and execute the instruction. The wireless gaming device does not send an acknowledgement message to the central processor although the receiver may receive a transmission from the wireless gaming device that the instruction was received properly. The central processor also communicates with the receiver in a similar manner except that the receiver may send an acknowledgement message to the central processor which includes the acknowledgement control protocol character.

Similarly the wireless gaming device communicates with the receiver and the central processor using e.g. hexadecimal character strings. The receiver regularly and periodically polls the active wireless gaming device for information requests or wagering requests. If the player has entered a request into the wireless gaming device since the last time the wireless gaming device was polled then the player s request will be transmitted to the receiver.

Various embodiments include methods by which the wireless gaming device receives and relays player requests to the central processor. First the player enters a request into the wireless gaming device using buttons or keys. The player then presses a button labeled e.g. enter or send instructing the wireless gaming device to send the request the next time the receiver polls the wireless gaming device. When this button has been pressed the red light of the bicolor LED is illuminated thereby informing the player that the request is waiting to be sent. The request is converted into a hexadecimal character string including e.g. a header character an identification code or alternatively a separate identification string reserved for a specific player the current wager amount the player s request e.g. to change the wager amount or to send a balance update an end of message character and a checksum character. The next time the receiver polls the device the transmitter of the device transmits the character string to the receiver. When the wireless gaming device is polled by the receiver the green light of the bicolor LED flashes informing the player that the request has been transmitted. The receiver receives the request string and transmits the string to the central processor. The central processor then acts on the player s request.

Using the terminal the game official may process wagering transactions and distribute wireless gaming devices. In various embodiments the terminal may include a bar code reader and or a magnetic stripe reader for rapid entry of the identifier of a wireless gaming device prior to delivering the wireless gaming device to the player. Reading devices provide information in the form of digital data to the terminal. The terminal includes a keyboard by which the game official can manually enter data to be sent to the central processor. Using either reading device the keyboard or a combination of these the game official communicates with the central processor to establish a player s account increase the balance of the account when the player tenders funds to the game official and decrease the balance of the account when the player seeks to collect the cash value of his account balance.

The player establishes a balance of the account associated with his wireless gaming device identified by an identifier when he receives the wireless gaming device from the game official. The player may increase the monetary value of the balance of the account by paying additional funds in the form of cash or credit to the game official who accesses the account stored in the central processor through the terminal to increase the balance of the account.

The wireless gaming device is returned to the game official after the player has played one or more games. The readers may be used to read the identifier for closing out the player s account stored in the database of the central processor. The terminal includes a terminal display which notifies the game official of the balance of the player s account so that the player may be paid the cash value of the remaining balance of his account.

In some embodiments an account status display device is located in the gaming establishment to display players account information. In various embodiments the display device may be e.g. a liquid crystal display or a cathode ray tube display. The display device is controlled by the central processor which sends information to the display device for display to the players.

A player may look at the display device to confirm that wagers transmitted from the wireless gaming device were received by the receiver and sent to the central processor to determine the monetary balance of the player s account and to verify that the player s winnings have been credited to his account. The display device displays key information necessary for a player to participate in a game. The information displayed for each player may include the account number the player s account balance the player s last wager and the player s last prize award or win.

The display device is divided into specific areas e.g. a display area each area showing the account information for one player. The size of the display area may be determined by the size of the display device and the number of players who possess wireless display devices. It is contemplated that only active accounts will be displayed on the display device. If additional display devices are required to display the information concerning a large number of accounts the central processor may be configured to drive multiple similar display devices.

The display device may also be used to display the odds and payouts for game wagers. Alternately a separate display device driven by the central processor may be used to display the odds and payout information. Further the odds and payouts may be displayed on the device display .

Procedures for using the wireless interactive gaming system according to some embodiments are now described. In some embodiments a player tenders money in the form of cash or credit e.g. 100 to a game official in the gaming establishment to establish an account. The game official chooses a wireless gaming device and uses e.g. the bar code reader on the terminal to enter the identifier of the wireless gaming device into the terminal. The game official also inputs the amount of money tendered i.e. 100 into the terminal via keyboard. The game official hands the wireless gaming device to the player and tells the player that his account is e.g. Account No. . Alternately the player may identify his account number directly from the identifier on the wireless gaming device. The information entered by the game official into the terminal is sent to the central processor which establishes an account record for the player in the database.

For this example the central processor may be conducting a racing game in which players choose a winning racing element on which to place a wager for the next racing game to be displayed in the gaming establishment. To place a wager the player presses buttons on the wireless gaming device.

In some embodiments the player first presses the button that corresponds to the number assigned to the racing element that he chooses e.g. 3 and then the wager amount e.g. and 5 for a 5 wager. The player then presses the enter key to transmit his wager to the central processor.

In an alternate embodiment the game may be simplified so that all wagers are placed for a fixed amount e.g. 1 by pressing a single button on the wireless gaming device. By pressing the button that corresponds to the number assigned to the chosen racing element e.g. 3 the player places a 1 bet on racing element number . The player can then place a larger wager on racing element number 3 by pressing the 3 button the number of times corresponding to the number of 1 bets he desires to make e.g. by pressing 3 five times to wager 5 on racing element number .

Each time the player enters a wager the wireless gaming device forms a data packet containing the player s wager information and the identification code of the wireless gaming device. The data packet is encrypted and transmitted by the transmitter via wireless communication.

The decoder in the receiver receives the encrypted data packet transmitted by the transmitter. The encrypted data packet is sent to the central processor where it is decrypted. The central processor uses the information it has obtained to update the player s account in the database by subtracting the wagered amount from the player s account balance and registers the player s wager on the game.

After the game has been played the central processor awards prizes to winning players based on the wagers they have made and the odds associated with the winning outcome of the game. If the player in possession of the wireless gaming device is a winner the central computer updates the player s account in the database by adding the monetary amount of the prize to the player s account balance. Otherwise the player s account remains unchanged.

When the player has finished playing games in the gaming establishment he returns the wireless gaming device to the game official. The game official again inputs the identifier of the wireless gaming device into the terminal e.g. by using the bar code reader of the terminal. The terminal accesses the player s account information stored in the database of the central processor to obtain the player s remaining account balance. The terminal display displays the player s remaining account balance to the game official who then tenders the monetary value of that amount to the player. The account is closed and the transaction is recorded in the central processor.

It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.

Various embodiments include a hand held wireless game player for playing a game of chance. The hand held wireless game player may be generally characterized as including 1 a wire less communication interface 2 a display screen 3 one or more input mechanisms and 4 a microprocessor configured i to present the game of chance on the display screen using operating instructions received via the wireless communication interface from a master gaming controller located on a gaming machine and ii to send information from input signals generated from the one or more input mechanisms to the master gaming controller via the wire less communication interface.

It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.

Referring to and the video image in the display area may be either a direct image or a virtual image in various embodiments. If the video image is a direct image as in the direct image may be generated by a flat panel transmissive video display positioned in front of the reels . The transmissive display may for example be a transmissive liquid crystal display LCD commercially available from LG Phillips LCD Co. Ltd. of Seoul Korea. The transmissive display may be outfitted with a touch screen mounted to a front surface of the display . The touch screen contains soft touch keys denoted by the image on the underlying display and used to operate the slot machine .

If the video image is a virtual image as in the virtual image is preferably generated by a projection arrangement including a video display and a partially reflective minor . The video display and the partially reflective minor are relatively positioned to project the virtual image in front of the reels between the reels and a player. The video display may be mounted below the reels and is generally perpendicular to the display area . The mirror may be mounted in front of the reels and is oriented at approximately a forty five degree angle relative to both the video display and the display area . The virtual image is generally parallel to the display area and may in fact occupy the display area . Also the virtual image may be three dimensional. In the embodiment of the display area includes a glass cover window. This cover is optionally outfitted with a touch screen that contains soft touch keys denoted by the virtual image and used to operate the slot machine .

The video display in may be a CRT LCD dot matrix LED electro luminescent or other type of video display. Also instead of mounting the video display below the reels the display may be mounted above the reels with the minor still oriented at approximately a forty five degree angle relative to both the video display and the display area .

Referring back to the slot machine is operable to play a basic slot game with the three mechanical spinning reels and a bonus game triggered by a start bonus outcome in the basic game. The number of mechanical reels may vary for example to include one or more additional reels. The mechanical reels may be mounted to a horizontal axis to spin vertically as shown or may alternatively be mounted to a vertical axis to spin horizontally. Also instead of each column of symbols being associated with a single reel each individual symbol may associated with a single reel such that a symbol array of nine symbols is associated with nine distinct reels. Each of five pay lines extends through one symbol on each of the three mechanical reels. The number of pay lines may be more or less than five and may have various configurations.

Generally game play is initiated by inserting a number of coins or playing a number of credits causing a central processing unit to activate a number of pay lines corresponding to the number of coins or credits played. As shown in the superimposed video image may depict instructional information prompting the player to insert coins or play credits. The player selects the number of pay lines e.g. between one and five to play by pressing a Select Lines key on a button panel . The player then chooses the number of coins or credits to bet on the selected pay lines by pressing a Bet Per Line key on the button panel . As shown in the superimposed video image may depict the activated pay lines and the number of wagered credits per pay line.

After activation of the pay lines the reels may be set in motion by touching a Spin Reels key on the button panel or if the player wishes to bet the maximum amount per line by using a Max Bet Spin key on the button panel . Alternatively other mechanisms such as for example a lever may be used to set the reels in motion. The central processing unit uses a random number generator to select a game outcome e.g. basic game outcome corresponding to a particular set of reel stop positions. The central processing unit then causes each of the mechanical reels to stop at the appropriate stop position. Symbols are printed on the reels to graphically illustrate the reel stop positions and indicate whether the stop positions of the reels represent a winning game outcome.

Winning basic game outcomes e.g. symbol combinations resulting in payment of coins or credits are identifiable to the player by a pay table. As shown in the superimposed video image may depict the pay table in response to a command by the player e.g. by pressing a Pay Table key on the button panel . A winning basic game outcome occurs when the symbols appearing on the reels along an active pay line correspond to one of the winning combinations on the pay table. A winning combination for example could be three matching symbols along an active pay line. If the displayed symbols stop in a winning combination the game credits the player an amount corresponding to the award in the pay table for that combination multiplied by the amount of credits bet on the winning pay line. As shown in the superimposed video image may highlight the winning combination s e.g. 7 7 7 and its associated pay line e.g. pay line and depict the award for that winning combination. The video image may further include special effects such as flashing the winning pay line s and or the award and providing explosions. The winning pay line s may flash be accompanied by exploding flashes and display a portion of the pay table. The player may collect the amount of accumulated credits by pressing a Collect key on the button panel . In one implementation the winning combinations start from the first reel left to right and span adjacent reels. In an alternative implementation the winning combinations start from either the first reel left to right or the third reel right to left and span adjacent reels

A game may have a pay table that defines all possible outcomes of one play of the game that can result in awarding a prize to a player.

In various embodiments each line of the pay table defines the number of coins required to be played the criteria that defines a win the odds of the win criteria resulting from one play of the game and the number of coins returned by the gaming device to the player when a win is registered. In addition a pay line may include the ability to accept a progressive prize value from the system. In various progressive gaming systems and methods this allows the game s pay line to be linked to a system controlled progressive prize.

A pay table may include a list of payouts on a slot machine or a video poker machine. The table may show for each combination of symbols and the number of coins bet how main coins the bettor will win.

On older machines and some newer reel machines the pay table may be listed on the face of the machine usually above and below the area containing the wheels.

Each machine may have a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. The pay table details where the symbols must be for the bettor to be paid. In general the symbols must be centered directly under the pay line on the machine. Video slot machines generally will only display the pay line for lines that are winners.

Some machines offer symbols that are wild and will pay if they are visible in any position even if they are not on the pay line. These wild symbols may also count for any other symbol on the pay table.

Most video machines display the pay table when the player presses a pay table button or touches pay table on the screen some have the pay table listed on the cabinet as well.

Games of chance may be described as either progressive or non progressive. In non progressive games such as traditional pull tab participants play for a chance to win a predetermined prize i.e. one of the winning cards. Progressive games in contrast involve a jackpot or prize that grows during the play of the game. Many state numbers lotteries for instance fall into the progressive category because the prize increases over time as more players participate. During the operation of a progressive game a portion of each player s purchase is dedicated to the prize. Thus the prize grows until the winning numbers are selected and the game ends. Some slot machines also offer a progressive jackpot.

In various progressive gaming systems and methods a portion of each wager is used to fund an increment to the current prize value fund the starting value of the next prize after a win occurs and other uses. Commonly the portion used usually known as contributions is determined by control data related to percentages and the coin denomination.

For example assume a prize starts at 1 000 000 with a contribution rate of 3.5 to fund the next prize s starting value of 1 000 000 and a 2.5 contribution rate to the growth of the current prize s value. Also assume it is linked to gaming devices requiring a 2.00 wager. This means each wager contributes 0.07 2.00 0.035 0.07 to the next prize s starting value and 0.05 2.00 0.025 0.05 to the increment of the current prize value. With these contribution percentages there must be about 14 285 715 handle pulls or games played between wins for the prize s 1 000 000 starting amount to be funded. 1 000 000 0.07 14 285 714.29 . In essence the total wager amount made over the theoretical life cycle of one prize award would be 28 571 430.00 14 285 715 2.00 28 571 430.00 .

During this theoretical time period the prize value would increase by 714 285 0.05 14 285 714.29 714 285.7145 to make the average prize value worth 1 714 285 for each theoretical win. Also assume that a marketing study has determined that to sustain player interest the prize should be won on average about once every month. This means there should be about 14 285 715 handle pulls or games played over a thirty day time span. If each gaming device were able to average about 5 games played each minute for 10 hours a day it would produce 3000 games played per day. If the prize were to be won every thirty days and each gaming device generates 90 000 handle pulls a month 5 games 60 minute hour 10 hours 30 days 90 000 there would have to be at least 159 gaming devices attached to the prize 14 285 715 90 000 158.73 . . . .

Often machines are linked together in a way that allows a group of machines to offer a particularly large prize or jackpot . Each slot machine in the group contributes a small amount to this progressive jackpot which is awarded to a player who gets for example a royal flush on a video poker machine or a specific combination of symbols on a regular or 9 line slot machine. The amount paid for the progressive jackpot is usually far higher than any single slot machine could pay on its own.

In some cases multiple machines are linked across multiple casinos. In these cases the machines may be owned by the machine maker who is responsible for paying the jackpot. The casinos lease the machines rather than owning them outright. Megabucks including Megabucks Nevada and penny Megabucks is an example of linked machines across multiple casinos.

Various embodiments include networked gaming devices. Interconnecting a plurality of gaming devices such as slot machines via a computer network to a central computer may provide advantages. Some advantages of networked gaming devices may include the ability to extract accounting data from the individual gaming devices as well as providing player tracking. Various network systems allow the central host computer to monitor the usage and payout collectively known as audit data of the individual gaming devices. This audit data includes data related to the number of coins or tokens inserted into the device the number of times the device has been played the amount paid in raises the number and the type of jackpots paid by the machine the number of door openings etc. The host computer can then compile an accounting report based on the audit data from each of the individual gaming devices. This report can then be used by management for example to assess the profitability of the individual gaming devices.

In some areas regulations may encourage or require a relatively detailed accounting of each video gaming machine s activity to assure that the machine operates within regulated standards. Meters are often provided to track money input into and money dispensed from the machines. Because money may sometimes be inserted to a machine but not wagered for example where a player inserts a certain amount of cash or credit but cashes out before betting the entire amount the simple ratio of money in to money out does not necessarily accurately reflect the machine s operational activities. Accordingly it may be helpful to also track the amount of money wagered and the amount of money or credits won by the player.

In larger facilities such as casinos a central computer may monitor such information for a plurality of embedded system single player gaming machines through a location controller. Each video gaming machine serially communicates with the location controller to provide appropriate information to the central computer. If the central computer detects an irregularity regarding a particular game it instructs the location controller to deactivate the game. An exemplary system including a location controller and embedded system circuitry at a video gaming machine for providing information to the location controller is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 429 361 and 5 470 079 the entire disclosure of each of these patents being hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

The first network of gaming units may be provided in a first casino or facility and the second network of gaming units may be provided in a second casino or facility located in a separate geographic location than the first facility. For example the two facilities may be located in different areas of the same city or they may be located in different states. The network may include a plurality of network computers or server computers not shown each of which may be operatively interconnected. Where the network comprises the Internet data communication may take place over the communication links via an Internet communication protocol.

The network computer may be a server computer and may be used to accumulate and analyze data relating to the operation of the gaming units . For example the network computer may continuously receive data from each of the gaming units indicative of the dollar amount and number of wagers being made on each of the gaming units data indicative of how much each of the gaming units is paying out in winnings data regarding the identity and gaming habits of players playing each of the gaming units etc. The network computer may be a server computer and may be used to perform the same or different functions in relation to the gaming units as the network computer described above.

Although each network is shown to include one network computer and four gaming units it should be understood that different numbers of computers and gaming units may be utilized. For example the network may include a plurality of network computers and tens or hundreds of gaming units all of which may be interconnected via the data link . The data link may provided as a dedicated hardwired link or a wireless link. Although the data link is shown as a single data link the data link may comprise multiple data links.

Various embodiments include a system for operating networked gaming devices. The system according to various embodiments allows a casino in which the system is installed to run promotions or bonuses on any properly equipped gaming machines while simultaneously gathering player tracking and accounting data from all machines. The system provides the capability for the casino to select which of the plurality of machines are used in any given promotion. The system further allows any number of different promotions to operate simultaneously.

The system includes a plurality of gaming devices or machines connected to an associated floor controller over a network. The system includes one or more of said floor controllers. The floor controllers are interconnected by a high speed network such as an Ethernet network to a database where accounting and player tracking data is stored. The system can also include pit terminals and or fill and jackpot processing terminals. Each promotion involves sending a reconfiguration command from the floor controller to a gaming device that has been selected to be part of a given promotion over the associated network. Upon receipt of the reconfiguration command the gaming device reconfigures its payout schedule in accordance with the received reconfiguration command. In some embodiments this reconfiguration includes activating a bonus payout schedule. A partial list of the promotions according may include without limitation a multiple jackpot wherein the gaming device reconfigures its payout to be a multiple of its default payout schedule a bonus jackpot wherein the gaming device reconfigures its payout schedule to payout an additional bonus amount when certain conditions are met and a progressive jackpot wherein two or more gaming devices are combined in a progressive jackpot having a progressive jackpot payout schedule. In addition to these many other promotions are possible by the above described system for controlling and monitoring a plurality of gaming devices.

The system may support player tracking in some embodiments by recording machine transactions including time of play machine number duration of play coins in coins out hand paid jackpots and games played. The player tracking is conducted over the same network as the accounting data is extracted. This allows the provision of bonusing to certain individual players as well as during certain times. Various embodiments include a system which monitors and reports how many coins are played by each player. The system according to various embodiments includes the ability to record how long each player spends at each machine and the number of coins won games played and hand jackpots won by each player. All this information is stored on the database which can be later analyzed for future targeted direct mailing campaigns. The player tracking according to various embodiments also allows the casino to schedule buses and other groups and measure their profitability. The system also allows for cashless play as well as advanced accounting and security features.

Various embodiments include the concept of a secondary or bonus game that may be played in conjunction with a basic game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game either similar to or completely different from the basic game which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome of the basic game.

Various embodiments comprise methods of playing games gaming devices and table games utilizing a primary game e.g. rotatable reels and at least one discernible indicia of a secondary game possibly comprising a payout indicator. The secondary game may be separate from the primary game either physically or temporally.

According to various embodiments a bonus payout indicator is clearly visible to a player and is operable when primary reels of a primary game slot machine stop on certain predetermined indicia. According to some embodiments a secondary payout indicator is in the form of a rotatable bonus wheel which can be caused to spin automatically or in response to some action by a player e.g. the player pushing a button when the primary game indicates one of a predetermined plurality of indicia. The wheel is caused to gradually reduce speed and when the wheel stops a pointer indicates the payout to be awarded to the player.

Various embodiments further comprise a discernible multiplier which provides the ability to change either the payout from the primary gaming unit or the secondary payout indicator or both. Various embodiments contemplate providing a payout from the primary gaming unit a payout indicated by the secondary indicator only a payout from the primary gaming unit or the secondary indicator as changed by the multiplier or a separate plurality of payouts from the primary gaming unit and the secondary indicator either with or without modification by a multiplier.

According to various embodiments the mechanical bonus payout indicator is electronically operated and is linked to a random number generator which determines where the secondary indicator actually stops.

According to various embodiments when the primary unit stops on one of a predetermined plurality of winning indicia sets a second event actuator is placed in an active state. According to various embodiments a person such as the player must actuate the actuator in order to operate the bonus indicator.

According to various embodiments the bonus actuator requires operator intervention so that a player must involve a casino attendant who can activate the bonus indicator.

According to another various embodiments the bonus indicator is connected to a drive mechanism which gradually reduces the rate of spin of the bonus wheel before the bonus wheel stops.

Various embodiments comprise gaming devices having electronic means for displaying indicia of rotatable reels such as a video screen and or means for displaying indicia of a secondary payout indicator such as a video screen. Various embodiments comprise methods for playing a game of chance. One method comprises the steps of displaying a first randomly selected combination of indicia said displayed indicia selected from the group consisting of slot reels indicia of at least one reel indicia of at least one playing card and combinations thereof generating at least one signal corresponding to at least one select display of first indicia providing at least one discernible indicia of a mechanical bonus indicator said bonus indicator indicia indicating at least one of a plurality of possible payouts wherein said bonus indicator indicia providing means is operatively connected to said first standard gaming unit and actuatable in response to said signal. According to various embodiments the discernable indicia of a mechanical bonus indicator gradually reduces the rate of movement of the mechanical bonus indicator for some period of time prior to actually providing the discernable indicia of a payout. According to another embodiment a multiplier is provided to multiply at least one payout by a multiple which is most preferably indicated to a player. The multiple can preferably sequentially change as discernable indicia change. For example a plurality of multiples can be synchronized with a plurality of discernable indicia on the mechanical bonus indicator such that the multiple changes as the payout indicated changes.

Various embodiments include a method of conducting a game of chance comprising the steps of providing a player with an opportunity to place a wager displaying a randomly selected combination of indicia said displayed indicia selected from the group consisting of reels indicia of at least one and preferably a plurality of reels indicia of at least one and preferably a plurality of playing cards and combination thereof generating at least one signal corresponding to at least one select display of said indicia providing at least one discernible indicia of a mechanical bonus indicator said bonus indicator indicia indicating at least one of a plurality of possible bonuses wherein said bonus indicator indicia is in the form of a wheel or reel and is actuatable in response to said signal.

A bonus game may include another gaming machine or a random selection device which is enabled by a bonus qualifying signal from an underlying or primary gaming machine. A wide variety of bonus games features and devices are known some of which are set forth next.

The WHEEL OF GOLD and WHEEL OF FORTUNE slot casino games incorporate a single play bonusing feature. A rotating wheel is activated by the player depressing a bonus spin button when certain indicia appears on the reels of the slot game and is used to award bonus payouts in a spin of the wheel. A separate multiplier may be used to multiply the bonus payouts. After the bonus spin play resumes in the underlying gaming machine.

In various embodiments a bonus game involving multiple plays is presented for an underlying gaming machine such as a slot machine. Here a Bernoulli trial procedure is used to allow a player to repeatedly play a high odds bonus game such as another slot game and receive awards until a losing combination occurs i.e. winning until losing . The hit rate in the bonus game is greater than 50 possibly higher than 70 which may result in a much lower hit rate in the underlying game. This hit rate difference causes the player to endure the low hit rate of the underlying slot game in order to qualify for the high hit rate of the bonus game. The length of the bonus game is longer when the hit rate for the bonus game is higher. This bonus feature allows a player to win each bonus game and collect winnings until the player receives a losing combination i.e. losing until winning .

One slot machine main game is interconnected with a slot machine secondary game. The player has the option of pushing a button which debits his credit meter by the appropriate amount to play the secondary game such as another slot game. Hence the player gambles an amount in order to play the bonus game.

Various embodiments include an electronic gaming apparatus and method therefore wherein each play in the bonus is the result of successive underlying game play. Included are an electronic primary gaming device such as a poker or a slot machine and an electronic secondary gaming device based on bingo. When a winning combination such as three queens appears in the primary game a space in the bingo matrix is turned over to reveal a bingo symbol. Play continues on the primary game until a winning sequence occurs in the bingo game. The right to play the bingo secondary game does not occur unless the player inserts three or more coins into the primary game. Play continues until the game achieves a bingo in which case the player receives a prize.

Various embodiments include a slot machine having a jackpot feature whereby the prize value is transferred between separate jackpot displays as successive games are played. Some of the reel symbols are overprinted with a number and when that number lands on the payline it is used to climb a ladder. The ladder enables the player to obtain one or all of the prizes in the upper portion of the slot machine. For example if the overlaid number lands the player on a first playing level then the player receives all three prizes. If the overlaid number lands the player on a second level then the player can select which one of the three prizes to receive. If the player lands on a third level then it becomes a game of skill to select which of the three prizes he selects. Finally if the player lands on a fourth level then the prize is randomly selected. The prize may also be randomly doubled.

Various embodiments include a plurality of slot machines interconnected to an electronic controller which displays a separate race game. Each time a particular predetermined combination of indicia appears in the display of a particular slot machine a signal is generated from the slot machine which advances the racing element through a particular predetermined distance. If the player s horse reaches the finish line before a timer display times out then the slot player wins an additional prize. The players are not racing against each other but against a clock.

Various embodiments include a gaming machine including a processor operable in a basic mode and a bonus mode for controlling game play. In the basic mode the processor operates to select a basic game outcome from among a plurality of possible basic game outcomes. The possible basic game outcomes include a start bonus outcome the occurrence of which causes the processor to shift operation from the basic mode to the bonus mode. The processor is operable to define a plurality of player selectable bonus game outcomes. In the bonus mode a player selects one or more of the bonus game outcomes and credits are awarded based upon which ones of the bonus game outcomes are selected.

Various embodiments include a gaming machine including a processor operable to select a game outcome from among a number of possible game outcomes. A number of the possible game outcomes are identifiable according to a pay table as winning combinations whereas a remaining number of the possible game outcomes are identified as apparent losing combinations. The gaming machine includes means for awarding credits upon occurrences of the winning combinations and upon occurrence of at least one of the apparent losing combinations.

Various embodiments include a gaming machine including a processor operable in a basic mode and a bonus mode for controlling game play. In the basic mode the processor operates to select a basic game outcome from among a plurality of possible basic game outcomes. The possible basic game outcomes include one or more bonus resource outcomes the occurrence of which causes the processor to generate a bonus game resource exercisable in a bonus game. The gaming machine includes means for shifting operation of the processor from the basic mode to the bonus mode. The processor is operable to define a plurality of possible bonus game outcomes. In the bonus mode upon selection of a bonus game outcome the bonus game resource s generated in the basic game may be exercised to affect the bonus game outcome. In one embodiment where the bonus game outcome would otherwise cause the processor to end the bonus game an exercise of a bonus game resource in conjunction with the bonus game outcome causes the processor to continue operation in the bonus mode thereby allowing the player to continue playing the bonus game.

A coin slot currency validator or card acceptor device to accept a credit card gaming card player card smart card and the like permits a player to activate a base game on the slot machine . A player may have a predefined chance or odds of winning a payout for the base game based on the mathematical odds that a winning symbol or combination of symbols will be randomly displayed on the indicia of the reels . The odds may be adjusted by changing the number of possible non winning symbols or combination of non winning symbols in relation to the number of possible winning symbols or combination of winning symbols. The odds of winning a payback and the amount to be awarded to a winning player in relation to the amount wagered may be defined in the form of a pay table or par sheet. 

Initiating a base game on a slot machine may be done as simply as by inserting a coin token or other type of currency equivalent debit card or credit card into a gaming device such as slot machine . Another example of a player action which may be taken in initiating a base game includes inserting an identification card such as a smart card having a programmed microchip or a magnetic strip coded with a player s identification credit totals and other relevant information. Such smart cards or player cards may be used in player tracking systems. Various embodiments include a card that contains information about the player which is pertinent to the gaming activity such as points awarded based upon the player s gaming activity. The player may insert the card in a gaming device at the time of play. When the player indicates that he or she has finished play on that gaming device the card is updated with player activity information. The player can then insert the card into a different gaming device which makes the player activity information stored on the card available to the player tracking system. In various embodiments a gaming device may accept preprinted coupons or cash out slips to initiate a base game and to print the cash out slips directly from the gaming device. In various embodiments money may be transferred to a game through an electronic funds transfer process.

Gaming device displays may include multiple images representing various aspects of a game such as a game portion a credit total portion and a wager amount portion. Other displays may include an additional bonus award portion to indicate an amount of a bonus award which may be won typically through multiple or secondary games.

In various embodiments it is also possible to participate in a game of chance via the Internet. This may be accomplished through a casino or game host site offering displays similar to those found in conventional gaming devices. Generally to play a game of chance via the Internet a software file is downloaded to a player s computer or terminal which may then be used to install the necessary software for the game and access the casino or game host Internet site. In some a player may play a game through a web page e.g. an html page a page using AJAX etc. . As with a conventional gaming device Internet games may be accessed using an identification code or name to identify the specific player and retrieve that player s credit total or play history.

Bonus gaming may include employing a secondary game that will execute if the player achieves a predefined outcome associated with the base game. In many cases the bonus game is a singular event in that the play changes to the bonus game when a certain base game outcome is achieved and the bonus game is then played to completion. For example when the reels of a slot machine stop on certain predetermined indicia a bonus game may be initiated by pressing a button and bonus indicator actuated to display a randomly determined bonus award. In various embodiments the bonus game is a more sequential event in that progress through the bonus game is determined by continued play in the base game.

In some bonus game embodiments the possible primary game outcomes include a special symbol combination that causes a computer processor to generate a bonus game resource exercisable in the bonus game. For example one or more bonus game resources can be used to override the end bonus outcome and thereby allow the play of the bonus game to continue.

Various embodiments allow the player to have further interaction in the bonus game by providing a touch screen where the player can select objects by touching the screen positions. Various values are then revealed to the player until an end bonus outcome is encountered.

In various embodiments bonus gaming may be conducted through a plurality of networked or linked gaming devices such that the secondary gaming activity might involve a plurality of players wagering on base games at separate gaming devices. Various bonus games may allow a player to compete with a plurality of other players for a secondary prize. In various embodiments a bonus game may include one or more contestants in a race. In one embodiment each player wagering at a primary gaming unit may be represented by a particular contestant in the race. The contestant representing a particular player advances in the race according to the represented player s gaming activity at the primary gaming unit. The race ends upon a contestant finishing or upon the expiration of a predetermined amount of time whichever comes first.

Various embodiments include a system of linked gaming devices wherein the generation of certain symbols at each gaming device is used to build up a pooled bonus value. A bonus award is then awarded to the player that causes the accumulated bonus value to meet or exceed a predetermined value.

Various gaming systems may include progressive systems in which the bonus award amount increments as base games are played on individual or linked gaming devices. In various progressive systems a game controller is connected to a plurality of machines. A win is generated approximately every one half minute every eight handle pulls adding to the progressive bonus pool. Accordingly the value of the progressive bonus rapidly increments.

Various gaming systems and methods for providing a bonus game allow players to compete directly against another player or for the players to act in collaboration with one another to win a prize.

A game apparatus having a plurality of reels mounted for rotation about an axis and which can be set into motion by the pulling of a lever. Indicia are fixed to the outer peripheries of these reels to indicate reel positions and a brake is operable to stop the reels at any randomly pre selected position.

A random number generator is provided with electronic circuitry which computes the random stop position at which the reel should be stopped by the physical brake. This is done with an electronically random number selected from a group of numbers which exceeds the number of physical reel positions such that one physical reel position is represented by one or several positions on the virtual or electronically generated reel which is in affect randomly stopped by the random number generator. In various embodiments the physical reels are only used as a display of the random number generated result and are not the game itself as in standard slot machines. In this manner a standard slot machine or gaming apparatus can be made to function at payout odds independent of the limits set by the number of physical reels and their physical stop positions by changing the random number generator.

In various embodiments slot machines are computerized so that the odds of various outcomes are whatever they are programmed to be. In various embodiments the reels and lever may be present for historical and entertainment reasons. In various embodiments the positions the reels will come to rest on are chosen by a random number generator RNG contained in the machine s software.

The RNG may be constantly generating random numbers at a rate of thousands to millions per second. As soon as the lever is pulled or the Play button is pressed the most recent random number may be used to determine the result. This means that the result may vary depending on exactly when the game is played. A fraction of a second earlier or later and the result may be different. In various embodiments the RNG may be a pseudorandom number generators

A gaming device apparatus may include a player tracking card that may be disposed in the card reader. The player tracking card may comprise a data storage device that stores data representing the identification of a player. Additionally the player tracking card may comprise a first card surface a second card surface and a light transmissive body portion extending between the first card surface and the second card surface. The player tracking card may be positioned in a card illumination position wherein the first card surface is disposed in the card reader so that the first card surface is positioned adjacent the light generating source associated with the card reader and the second card surface of the player tracking card remains visible outside the card reader. Also when said player tracking card is in the card illumination position light generated by the light generating source may be transmitted into the first card surface of the player tracking card and then transmitted through the light transmissive body portion of the player tracking card so that light may be visible to the user through the second card surface.

Player tracking as the name indicates may involve tracking individual player usage of gaming devices. In various embodiments the player is issued a player identification card which has encoded thereon a player identification number that uniquely identifies the player. The individual gaming devices are fitted with a card reader into which the player inserts a player tracking card prior to playing the associated gaming device. The card reader reads the player identification number off the card and informs a central computer connected thereto of the player s subsequent gaming activity. By tracking the individual players individual player usage can be monitored by associating certain of the audit data with the player identification numbers. This allows gaming establishments to target individual players with direct marketing techniques according to the individual s usage.

The card reader of may also include a number of light generating sources . The light generating sources shown in are fixed to the back structure of the chassis however the light generating sources may also be secured directly to the housing of the gaming apparatus or any other structure within the housing that is separate from the card reader . The light generating sources may comprise LEDs OLEDs incandescent lamps fluorescent lights or any other device capable of generating light. If a plurality of the light generating sources are used they may produce light that is uniform in color or they may produce a plurality of different colors. The light generating sources may be connected to the controller through a plurality of corresponding conductors to control the intensity and pattern of illumination of the light generating sources . The conductors may be connected to a modular connector for ease of installation into the gaming apparatus .

The player tracking card may be positioned in the card illumination position when the card is disposed in the card reader and a first card surface is adjacent the light generating sources . In the embodiment shown in the player tracking card may rest on the side rails and and the first card surface may abut the back structure of the chassis when the player tracking card is in the card illumination position. Thus when the player tracking card is in the card illumination position light generated by the light generating sources is transmitted into the first card surface of the player tracking card .

A data reading apparatus may also be included in the gaming apparatus to read data from the player tracking card that is disposed in the card reader . The data reading apparatus may be attached to the chassis so that it is in close proximity to the player tracking card when the player tracking card is disposed in the card reader and in the card illumination position. The data reading apparatus may read data from the player tracking card in a variety of ways. For example the data reading apparatus may read data from a magnetic strip or from an optically readable material such as ink both of which may be located on a surface of the player tracking card . Various embodiments may utilize multiple data reading apparatuses to read data from additional magnetic strips or optically readable materials located on the same surface or on different surfaces of the player tracking card . As another example the data reading apparatus may utilize an antenna to couple with a corresponding antenna in the player tracking card so that data is thereby transmitted.

The data reading apparatus may be interconnected to the controller so that the data may be stored and possibly acted on such as by energizing a light generating source . While not shown a data writing apparatus may also be included to write new data to the player tracking card . This may be a separate component or it may be combined with the data reading apparatus .

A gaming apparatus for example as may be located in a casino may allow a customer of the casino to play one or more games such as poker blackjack slots keno and bingo. A customer may approach a gaming apparatus and select a desired game from the games offered on the gaming apparatus. Upon selection of the desired game that game may appear on the gaming apparatus at which time the customer may be allowed to play.

During play the customer may place a wager and proceed with the selected game. For example where the customer is playing slots a lever may be pulled to spin the reels. The reels may then stop on various symbols which may determine the customer s payout for that spin after which the customer may place another wager and proceed as discussed above. Where the customer has selected to play blackjack or poker the player may hit a deal card button to deal out the cards for the respective card game. The customer may alter his wager during the particular hand based on which cards are dealt and in some card games replace cards or continue to request cards. After all replacements and or requests are made a payout may be determined and the player may continue by placing another wager and playing a new hand.

The input control panel may be provided with a plurality of pushbuttons or touch sensitive areas that may be pressed by a player to select games make wagers make gaming decisions etc.

A reel spinning slot machine may comprise a plurality of mechanical rotatable reels controlled by a processor. In response to a wager the processor randomly selects an outcome from a plurality of possible outcomes and then causes the reels to be rotated and stopped to display the selected outcome. The selected outcome is represented by certain symbols on the reels being in visual association with a display area. If the selected outcome corresponds to a winning outcome identified on a pay table the processor instructs a payoff mechanism to award a payoff for that winning outcome to the player in the form of coins or credits.

In one embodiment a slot machine comprises a CPU and a reel mechanism. The CPU operates the slot machine in response to a wager. The reel mechanism includes a motor a symbol bearing reel and a reel driver. The motor includes a rotatable shaft and the reel is mounted to the shaft. The reel driver includes a local microcontroller distinct from and coupled to the CPU. The reel driver is coupled to the motor to cause the motor to rotate the reel.

The CPU issues high level commands to the reel driver related to rotation of the reel. The high level commands may for example include a start spin command for starting rotation of the reel and a stop command for stopping the reel at a specified position. However to free up the CPU for other tasks the local microcontroller performs low level reel driver operations related to the rotation of the reel. The low level reel driver operations may for example include sampling a state of the reel in real time performing calculations and responding with control changes.

A fixed pool game may include a game in which a specified amount of money or prizes the prizes having calculable monetary equivalents are distributed into a set of individually purchasable and winnable units where each individual unit has a known cost and where the set further includes purchasable units having no prize. Thus the total amount of prizes the prize distribution i.e. the number of prizes at each level and the total return if all individually purchasable units are sold are known at the game s outset.

The individually purchasable units may be generated and distributed as tickets. Two forms of tickets may include pull tab tickets which may be called pulltabs and scratch off tickets which may be called scratchers. Pull tab tickets may be constructed from paper of various thickness having two layers. The first layer may have some type of indication of the purchasers winnings if any and the second layer may cover the first. The second layer may be glued to the first layer around three edges covering the results. The fourth edge may have a small tab allowing the purchaser to grab hold of it. The tab upon being pulled pulls the layers apart and reveals the purchasers winnings if any. Scratchers may use an opaque material that covers portions of the ticket where the covered portions have the predetermined results on them. The purchaser scrapes off the opaque material revealing any winnings.

The distribution of the total winnings coupled with the cost of each individually purchasable unit is determined by those making up the game. The exact mechanics and mathematics of each game pool depends on the goals of the issuer including the target play audience how much to charge per purchasable unit or ticket or play the desired return on investment and size of the pool as well as other considerations. The tickets individually purchasable units for the entire game are then printed and distributed and may be organized into decks with different decks sold to different locations. Players by purchasing a ticket are buying one individually purchasable unit from the overall ticket or game event pool.

This may be referred to as a fixed pool lottery meaning there is a fixed pool of tickets or results having a predetermined number of winners and losers and a purchaser takes a chance on getting a winning result by entering the lottery meaning taking the chance they will buy a winning ticket from the pool.

Fixed pool lottery based games may be displayed in many ways. For example such games may be displayed as a poker hand in order to mimic actual poker play.

The player may bet a certain amount to play the game. This corresponds to an individually purchasable unit note that different betting amounts may participate in different fixed pool lotteries for the lottery being used. The game may then get the result of a random drawing from a central server or location having several operating pools. The result may be sent back to the game machine. The game machine may then represent the results as a game.

Video wagering games may be set up to mimic a table game using adaptations of table games rules and cards.

When a player logs on to the game playing system their unit identifies itself to the administration unit. The system holds the details of the players in the register which contains separate player register units to for all the potential players i.e. for all the members of the system.

Once the player has been identified the player is assigned to a game unit . The game unit contains a set of player data units to a dealer unit a control unit and a random dealing unit .

Up to seven players can be assigned to the game unit . There can be several such units as indicated so that several games can be played at the same time if there are more than seven members of the system logged on at the same time. The assignment of a player unit to a player data unit may be arbitrary or random depending on which player data units and game units are free. Each player data unit is loaded from the corresponding player register unit and also contains essentially the same details as the corresponding player unit and is in communication with the player unit to keep the contents of the player unit and player data unit updated with each other. In addition the appropriate parts of the contents of the other player data units and the dealer unit are passed to the player unit for display.

The logic unit of the game unit steps the game unit through the various stages of the play initiating the dealer actions and awaiting the appropriate responses from the player units . The random dealing unit deals cards essentially randomly to the dealer unit and the player data units . At the end of the hand the logic unit passes the results of the hand i.e. the wins and or losses to the player data units to inform the players of their results. The administrative unit also takes those results and updates the player register units accordingly.

The player units are arranged to show a display. To identify the player the player s position is highlighted. As play proceeds so the player selects the various boxes enters bets in them and so on and the results of those actions are displayed. As the cards are dealt a series of overlapping card symbols is shown in the Bonus box. At the option of the player the cards can be shown in a line below the box and similarly for the card dealt to the dealer. At the end of the hand a message is displayed informing the player of the results of their bets i.e. the amounts won or lost.

In various embodiments gaming devices such as electronically controlled slot video and similar machines may include a central controller including a processor and a memory. The central controller controls the gaming machine including the presentation of one or more games to a player at the gaming machine.

The processor of the gaming controller may execute code to control the operation of the gaming machine. This code is stored at the memory of the gaming controller. The control code including specific game code may be loaded into the memory when the gaming machine is manufactured.

In various embodiments it may be desirable to change the control and or game code associated with the gaming machine controller. For example the operator may wish to change the paytable so that the gaming machine returns a higher percentage of bets wagered. The operator may also wish to update an older game with a newer more desirable one.

Various embodiments include a gaming machine code download system and a method of managing or controlling the download of code to a gaming machine.

Various embodiments comprise a method of downloading code information or data to a gaming machine from a remote device. In some embodiments the method includes the step of storing gaming machine code at the remote device. A request for gaming machine code is generated and the request is provided to the remote device. In accordance with some embodiments of the method the gaming machine code is transmitted from the remote device to a first device of the gaming machine over a communication link in response to the request.

The gaming code may also comprise a set of code permitting the gaming machine controller to present a particular game or games to a player.

Playing cards have been in existence for many years. Although there are many types of playing cards that are played in many different types of games the most common type of playing cards consists of 52 cards divided out into four different suits namely Spades Hearts Diamonds and Clubs which are printed or indicated on one side or on the face of each card. In the standard deck each of the four suits of cards consists of 13 cards numbered either two through ten or lettered A Ace K King Q Queen or J Jack which is also printed or indicated on the face of each card. Each card will thus contain on its face a suit indication along with a number or letter indication. The King Queen and Jack usually also include some sort of design on the face of the card and may be referred to as picture cards.

In some cases the 52 card standard playing deck also contains a number of extra cards sometimes referred to as jokers that may have some use or meaning depending on the particular game being played with the deck. For example if a card game includes the jokers then if a player receives a joker in his hand he may use it as any card in the deck. If the player has the ten jack queen and king of Spades along with a joker the player would use the joker as an Ace of Spades. The player will then have a Royal Flush ten through Ace of Spades .

Many different games can be played using a standard deck of playing cards. The game being played with the standard deck of cards may include other items such as game boards chips etc. or the game being played may only need the playing card deck itself. In most of the games played using a standard deck of cards a value is assigned to each card. The value may differ for different games.

Usually the card value begins with the number two card as the lowest value and increases as the numbers increase through ten followed in order of increasing value with the Jack Queen King and Ace. In some games the Ace may have a lower value than the two and in games where a particular card is determined to be wild or have any value that card may have the greatest value of all. For example in card games where deuces or twos are wild the player holding a playing card containing a two can use that two as any other card such that a nine and a two would be the equivalent of two nines.

Further the four different suits indicated on the cards may have a particular value depending on the game. Under game rules where one suit i.e. Spades has more value than another suit i.e. Hearts the seven of Spades may have more value than the seven of Hearts.

It is easy to visualize that using the different card quantity and suit values many different games can be played. In certain games it is the combination of cards that one player obtains that determines whether or not that player has defeated the other player or players. Usually the more difficult the combination is to obtain the more value the combination has and the player who obtains the more difficult combination also taking into account the value of the cards wins the game.

For instance in the game of Poker each player may ultimately receive five cards. The player who obtains three cards having similar numbers on their face i.e. the four of Hearts four of Diamonds and four of Clubs will defeat the player having only two cards with the same numerical value i.e. the King of Spades and the King of Hearts. However the player with five cards that all contain Clubs commonly known as a flush will defeat the player with the same three of a kind described above.

In many instances a standard deck of playing cards is used to create gaming machines. In these gaming machines players insert coins and play certain card games such as poker using an imitation of standard playing cards on a video screen in an attempt to win back more money than they originally inserted into the machine.

Another form of gambling using playing cards utilizes tables otherwise known as table games. A table uses a table and a dealer with the players sitting or standing around the table. The players place their bets on the table and the dealer deals the cards to each player. The number of cards dealt or whether the cards are dealt face up or face down will depend on the particular table game being played.

Further an imitation or depiction of a standard playing card is used in many handheld electronic games such as poker and blackjack and in many computer games and Internet games. Using a handheld electronic game or a computer terminal that may or may not be connected to the Internet a player receives the imitation playing cards and plays a card game either against the computer or against other players. Further many of these games can be played on the computer in combination with gambling.

Also there are many game shows that are broadcasted on television that use a deck of playing cards in the game play in which the cards are usually enlarged or shown on a video screen or monitor for easy viewing. In these television game shows the participants play the card game for prizes or money usually against each other with an individual acting as a host overseeing the action.

Also there are lottery tickets that players purchase and play by scratching off an opaque layer to see if they have won money and prizes. The opaque layer prevents the player from knowing the results of the lottery ticket prior to purchasing and scratching off the layer. In some of these lottery tickets playing cards are used under the opaque layer and the player may need to match a number of similar cards in order to win the prizes or money.

In a basic poker game which is played with a standard 52 card deck each player is dealt five cards. All five cards in each player s hand are evaluated as a single hand with the presence of various combinations of the cards such as pairs three of a kind straight etc. Determining which combinations prevail over other combinations is done by reference to a table containing a ranking of the combinations. Rankings in most tables are based on the odds of each combination occurring in the player s hand. Regardless of the number of cards in a player s hand the values assigned to the cards and the odds the method of evaluating all five cards in a player s hand remain the same.

Poker is a popular skill based card game in which players with fully or partially concealed cards make wagers into a central pot. The pot is awarded to the player or players with the best combination of cards or to the player who makes an uncalled bet. Poker can also refer to video poker a single player game seen in casinos much like a slot machine or to other games that use poker hand rankings.

The right to deal each hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a dealer button or buck. In a casino a house dealer handles the cards for each hand but a button typically a white plastic disk is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting.

For each hand one or more players are required to make forced bets to create an initial stake for which the players will contest. The dealer shuffles the cards he cuts and the appropriate number of cards are dealt to the players one at a time. Cards may be dealt either face up or face down depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds the players hands develop in some way often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round all bets are gathered into the central pot.

At any time during a betting round if a player makes a bet opponents are required to fold call or raise. If one player bets and no opponents choose to match the bet the hand ends immediately the bettor is awarded the pot no cards are required to be shown and the next hand begins. The ability to win a pot without showing a hand makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of poker hand rankings.

At the end of the last betting round if more than one player remains there is a showdown in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot.

Players each receive five as in five card draw or more cards all of which are hidden. They can then replace one or more of these cards a certain number of times.

Players receive cards one at a time some being displayed to other players at the table. The key difference between stud and draw poker is that players are not allowed to discard or replace any cards.

Players combine individually dealt cards with a number of community cards dealt face up and shared by all players. Two or four individual cards may be dealt in the most popular variations Texas hold em and Omaha hold em respectively.

A straight flush is a poker hand such as Q J which contains five cards in sequence all of the same suit. Two such hands are compared by their high card in the same way as are straights. The low ace rule also applies 5 4 3 2 A is a 5 high straight flush also known as a steel wheel . An ace high straight flush such as A K Q J 10 is known as a royal flush and is the highest ranking standard poker hand excluding five of a kind .

Four of a kind or quads is a poker hand such as 9 9 9 9 J which contains four cards of one rank and an unmatched card. It ranks above a full house and below a straight flush. Higher ranking quads defeat lower ranking ones. Between two equal sets of four of a kind possible in wild card and community card games the kicker determines the winner.

A full house also known as a boat or a full boat is a poker hand such as 3 3 3 6 6 which contains three matching cards of one rank plus two matching cards of another rank. It ranks below a four of a kind and above a flush. Between two full houses the one with the higher ranking set of three wins. If two have the same set of three possible in wild card and community card games the hand with the higher pair wins. Full houses are described by the three of a kind e.g. Q Q Q and pair e.g. 9 9 as in Queens over nines also used to describe a two pair Queens full of nines or simply Queens full .

A flush is a poker hand such as Q 10 7 6 4 which contains five cards of the same suit not in rank sequence. It ranks above a straight and below a full house. Two flushes are compared as if they were high card hands. In other words the highest ranking card of each is compared to determine the winner if both have the same high card then the second highest ranking card is compared etc. The suits have no value two flushes with the same five ranks of cards are tied. Flushes are described by the highest card as in queen high flush .

A straight is a poker hand such as Q J10 9 8 which contains five cards of sequential rank of varying suits. It ranks above three of a kind and below a flush. Two straights are ranked by comparing the high card of each. Two straights with the same high card are of equal value and split any winnings straights are the most commonly tied hands in poker especially in community card games . Straights are described by the highest card as in queen high straight or straight to the queen .

A hand such as A K Q J10 is an ace high straight and ranks above a king high straight such as K Q J 10 9 . But the ace may also be played as a 1 spot in a hand such as 5 4 3 2 A called a wheel or five high straight which ranks below the six high straight 5 4 3 2 . The ace may not wrap around or play both high and low in the same hand 3 2 A K Q is not a straight but just ace high no pair.

Three of a kind also called trips set or a prile is a poker hand such as 2 2 2 K 6 which contains three cards of the same rank plus two unmatched cards. It ranks above two pair and below a straight. Higher ranking three of a kind defeat lower ranking three of a kinds. If two hands have the same rank three of a kind possible in games with wild cards or community cards the kickers are compared to break the tie.

A poker hand such as J J 4 4 9 which contains two cards of the same rank plus two cards of another rank that match each other but not the first pair plus one unmatched card is called two pair. It ranks above one pair and below three of a kind. Between two hands containing two pair the higher ranking pair of each is first compared and the higher pair wins. If both have the same top pair then the second pair of each is compared. Finally if both hands have the same two pairs the kicker determines the winner. Two pair are described by the higher pair e.g. K K and the lower pair e.g. 9 9 as in Kings over nines Kings and nines or simply Kings up .

One pair is a poker hand such as 4 4 K 10 5 which contains two cards of the same rank plus three unmatched cards. It ranks above any high card hand but below all other poker hands. Higher ranking pairs defeat lower ranking pairs. If two hands have the same rank of pair the non paired cards in each hand the kickers are compared to determine the winner.

A high card or no pair hand is a poker hand such as K J 8 7 3 in which no two cards have the same rank the five cards are not in sequence and the five cards are not all the same suit. It can also be referred to as nothing or garbage and many other derogatory terms. It ranks below all other poker hands. Two such hands are ranked by comparing the highest ranking card if those are equal then the next highest ranking card if those are equal then the third highest ranking card etc. No pair hands are described by the one or two highest cards in the hand such as king high or ace queen high or by as many cards as are necessary to break a tie.

The use of joker as a bug creates a slight variation of game play. When a joker is introduced in standard poker games it functions as a fifth ace or can be used as a flush or straight card though it can be used as a wild card too . Normally casino draw poker variants use a joker and thus the best possible hand is five of a kind as in A A A A Joker.

Caribbean Stud poker may be played as follows. A player and a dealer are each dealt five cards. If the dealer has a poker hand having a value less than Ace King combination or better the player automatically wins. If the dealer has a poker hand having a value of an Ace King combination or better then the higher of the player s or the dealer s hand wins. If the player wins he may receive an additional bonus payment depending on the poker rank of his hand. In the commercial play of the game a side bet is usually required to allow a chance at a progressive jackpot. In Caribbean Stud poker it is the dealer s hand that must qualify. As the dealer s hand is partially concealed during play usually only one card at most is displayed to the player before player wagering is complete the player must always be aware that even ranked player hands can lose to a dealer s hand and no bonus will be paid out unless the side bet has been made and then usually only to hands having a rank of a flush or higher.

Some versions of Blackjack are now described. Blackjack hands are scored according to the point total of the cards in the hand. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it is 21 or less. If the total is greater than 21 it is a called a bust. Numbered cards 2 through 10 have a point value equal to their face value and face cards i.e. Jack Queen and King are worth 10 points. An Ace is worth 11 points unless it would bust a hand in which case it is worth 1 point. Players play against the dealer and win by having a higher point total no greater than 21. If the player busts the player loses even if the dealer also busts. If the player and dealer have hands with the same point value this is called a push and neither party wins the hand.

After the initial bets are placed the dealer deals the cards either from one or more but typically two hand held decks of cards or from a shoe containing multiple decks of cards generally at least four decks of cards and typically many more. A game in which the deck or decks of cards are hand held is known as a pitch game. Pitch games are generally not played in casinos. When playing with more than one deck the decks are shuffled together in order to make it more difficult to remember which cards have been dealt and which have not. The dealer deals two cards to each player and to himself. Typically one of the dealer s two cards is dealt face up so that all players can see it and the other is face down. The face down card is called the hole card. In a European variation the hole card is dealt after all the players cards are dealt and their hands have been played. The players cards are dealt face up from a shoe and face down if it is a pitch game.

A two card hand with a point value of 21 i.e. an Ace and a face card or a 10 is called a Blackjack or a natural and wins automatically. A player with a natural is conventionally paid 3 2 on his bet although in 2003 some Las Vegas casinos began paying 6 5 typically in games with only a single deck.

Once the first two cards have been dealt to each player and the dealer the dealer wins automatically if the dealer has a natural and the player does not. If the player has a natural and the dealer does not the player automatically wins. If the dealer and player both have a natural neither party wins the hand.

If neither side has a natural each player completely plays out their hand when all players have finished the dealer plays his hand.

The playing of the hand typically involves a combination of four possible actions hitting standing doubling down or splitting his hand. Often another action called surrendering is added. To hit is to take another card. To stand is to take no more cards. To double down is to double the wager take precisely one more card and then stand. When a player has identical value cards such as a pair of 8s the player can split by placing an additional wager and playing each card as the first card in two new hands. To surrender is to forfeit half the player s bet and give up his hand. Surrender is not an option in most casino games of Blackjack. A player s turn ends if he stands busts or doubles down. If the player busts he loses even if the dealer subsequently busts. This is the house advantage.

After all players have played their hands the dealer then reveals the dealer s hole card and plays his hand. According to house rules the prevalent casino rules the dealer must hit until he has a point total of at least 17 regardless of what the players have. In most casinos the dealer must also hit on a soft 17 e.g. an Ace and 6 . In a casino the Blackjack table felt is marked to indicate if the dealer hits or stands on a soft 17. If the dealer busts all remaining players win. Bets are normally paid out at odds of 1 1.

Four of the common rule variations are one card split Aces early surrender late surrender and double down restrictions. In the first variation one card is dealt on each Ace and the player s turn is over. In the second the player has the option to surrender before the dealer checks for Blackjack. In the third the player has the option to surrender after the dealer checks for Blackjack. In the fourth doubling down is only permitted for certain card combinations.

Insurance is a commonly offered betting option in which the player can hedge his bet by wagering that the dealer will win the hand. If the dealer s up card is an Ace the player is offered the option of buying Insurance before the dealer checks his hole card. If the player wishes to take Insurance the player can bet an amount up to half that of his original bet. The Insurance bet is placed separately on a special portion of the table which is usually marked with the words Insurance Pays 2 1. The player buying Insurance is betting that the dealer s hole card is one with a value of 10 i.e. a 10 Jack Queen or King . Because the dealer s up card is an Ace the player who buys Insurance is betting that the dealer has a natural. 

If the player originally bets 10 and the dealer shows an Ace the player can buy Insurance by betting up to 5. Suppose the player makes a 5 Insurance bet and the player s hand with the two cards dealt to him totals 19. If the dealer s hole card is revealed to be a 10 after the Insurance betting period is over the dealer checks for a natural before the players play their hands the player loses his original 10 bet but he wins the 5 Insurance bet at odds of 2 1 winning 10 and therefore breaking even. In the same situation if the dealer s hole card is not one with a value of ten the player immediately loses his 5 Insurance bet. But if the player chooses to stand on 19 and if the dealer s hand has a total value less than 19 at the end of the dealer s turn the player wins his original 10 bet making a net profit of 5. In the same situation if the dealer s hole card is not one with a value of ten again the player will immediately lose their 5 Insurance bet and if the dealer s hand has a total value greater than the player s at the end of both of their turns for example the player stood on 19 and the dealer ended his turn with 20 the player loses both his original 10 bet and his 5 Insurance bet.

Blackjack players can increase their expected winnings by several means one of which is basic strategy. Basic strategy is simply something that exists as a matter of general practice it has no official sanction. The basic strategy determines when to hit and when to stand as well as when doubling down or splitting in the best course. Basic strategy is based on the player s point total and the dealer s visible card. Under some conditions e.g. playing with a single deck according to downtown Las Vegas rules the house advantage over a player using basic strategy can be as low as 0.16 . Casinos offering options like surrender and double after split may be giving the player using basic strategy a statistical advantage and instead rely on players making mistakes to provide a house advantage.

A number of optional rules can benefit a skilled player for example if doubling down is permitted on any two card hand other than a natural if doubling down is permitted after splitting if early surrender forfeiting half the bet against a face or Ace up card before the dealer checks for Blackjack is permitted if late surrender is permitted if re splitting Aces is permitted splitting when the player has more than two cards in their hand and has just been dealt a second ace in their hand if drawing more than one card against a split Ace is permitted if five or more cards with a total no more than 21 is an automatic win referred to as Charlies .

Other optional rules can be detrimental to a skilled player. For example if a natural pays less than 3 2 e.g. Las Vegas Strip single deck Blackjack paying out at 6 5 for a natural if a hand can only be split once is re splitting possible for other than aces if doubling down is restricted to certain totals e.g. 9 11 or 10 11 if Aces may not be re split if the rules are those of no peek or European Blackjack according to which the player loses hands that have been split or doubled down to a dealer who has a natural because the dealer does not check for this automatically winning hand until the players had played their hands if the player loses ties with the dealer instead of pushing where neither the player or the dealer wins and the player retains their original bet.

Unlike some other casino games in which one play has no influence on any subsequent play a hand of Blackjack removes those cards from the deck. As cards are removed from the deck the probability of each of the remaining cards being dealt is altered and dealing the same cards becomes impossible . If the remaining cards have an elevated proportion of 10 value cards and Aces the player is more likely to be dealt a natural which is to the player s advantage because the dealer wins even money when the dealer has a natural while the player wins at odds of 3 2 when the player has a natural . If the remaining cards have an elevated proportion of low value cards such as 4s 5s and 6s the player is more likely to bust which is to the dealer s advantage because if the player busts the dealer wins even if the dealer later busts .

The house advantage in Blackjack is relatively small at the outset. By keeping track of which cards have been dealt a player can take advantage of the changing proportions of the remaining cards by betting higher amounts when there is an elevated proportion of 10 value cards and Aces and by better lower amounts when there is an elevated proportion of low value cards. Over time the deck will be unfavorable to the player more often than it is favorable but by adjusting the amounts that he bets the player can overcome that inherent disadvantage. The player can also use this information to refine basic strategy. For instance basic strategy calls for hitting on a 16 when the dealer s up card is a 10 but if the player knows that the deck has a disproportionately small number of low value cards remaining the odds may be altered in favor of standing on the 16.

There are a number of card counting schemes all dependent for their efficacy on the player s ability to remember either a simplified or detailed tally of the cards that have been played. The more detailed the tally the more accurate it is but the harder it is to remember. Although card counting is not illegal casinos will eject or ban successful card counters if they are detected.

Shuffle tracking is a more obscure and difficult method of attempting to shift the odds in favor of the player. The player attempts to track groups of cards during the play of a multi deck shoe follow them through the shuffle and then looks for the same group to reappear from the new shoe playing and betting accordingly.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 579 181 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference generally describes a system for automatically monitoring playing and wagering of a game. In one illustrated embodiment the system includes a card deck reader that automatically reads a respective symbol from each card in a deck of cards before a first one of the cards is removed from the deck. The symbol identifies a value of the card in terms of rank and suit and can take the form of a machine readable symbol such as a bar code area or matrix code or stacked code. In another aspect the system does not decode the read symbol until the respective card is dealt to ensure security.

 In another aspect the system can include a chip tray reader that automatically images the contents of a chip tray. The system periodically determines the number and value of chips in the chip tray from the image and compares the change in contents of the chip tray to the outcome of game play to verify that the proper amounts have been paid out and collected.

 In a further aspect the system can include a table monitor that automatically images the activity or events occurring at a gaming table. The system periodically compares images of the gaming table to identify wagering as well as the appearance removal and position of cards and or other objects on the gaming table. The table monitoring system can be unobtrusively located in the chip tray. 

U.S. Pat. No. 6 579 181 generally describes a drop box that automatically verifies an amount and authenticity of a deposit and reconciles the deposit with a change in the contents of the chip tray. The drop box can image different portions of the deposited item selecting appropriate lighting and resolutions to examine security features in the deposited item.

 In another aspect the system can employ some or all of the components to monitor the gaming habits of players and the performance of employees. The system can detect suspect playing and wagering patterns that may be prohibited. The system can also identify the win loss percentage of the players and the dealer as well as a number of other statistically relevant measures. Such measures can provide a casino or other gaming establishment with enhanced automated security and automated real time accounting. The measures can additionally provide a basis for automatically allocating complimentary benefits to the players. 

Various embodiments include an apparatus method and system which utilizes a card dispensing shoe with scanner and its associated software which enable the card dealer when dealing the game from a card dispensing shoe with scanner preferably placed on a game table where the twenty one game to be evaluated by the software is being played to use one or more keyboard s and or LCD displays coupled to the shoe to identify for the computer program the number of the active players seats or active players including the dealer s position relative thereto and their active play at the game table during each game round dealt from the shoe. These keyboards and LCD displays are also used to enter other data relevant to each seat s or player s betting and or decision strategies for each hand played. The data is analyzed by a computer software program designed to evaluate the strategy decisions and betting skills of casino twenty one or blackjack players playing the game of blackjack during real time. The evaluation software is coupled to a central processing unit CPU or host computer that is also coupled to the shoe s keyboard s and LCD displays. The dealer using one or more keyboard s attached to or carried by the shoe or a keyboard s located near the dealer is able to see and record the exact amount bet by each player for each hand played for the game to be evaluated. The optical scanner coupled to the CPU reads the value of each card dealt to each player s hand s and the dealer s hand as each card is dealt to a specific hand seat or position and converts the game card value of each card dealt from the shoe to the players and the dealer of the game to a card count system value for one or more card count systems programmed into the evaluation software. The CPU also records each players decision s to hit a hand and the dealer s decision to hit or take another card when required by the rules of the game as the hit card is removed from the shoe. The dealer uses one or more of the keyboards and LCD displays carried by the shoe to record each player s decision s to Insure Surrender Stand Double Down or Split a hand. When the dealer has an Ace or a Ten as an up card he she may use one or more of the keyboards to prompt the computer system s software since the dealer s second card or hole card which is dealt face down has been scanned and the game card value thereof has been imported into the computer systems software to instantly inform the dealer by means of one or more of the shoe s LCDs if his her game cards or hand total constitutes a two card 21 or Blackjack .

In various embodiments a card playing system for playing a card game which includes a card delivery shoe apparatus for use in dealing playing cards to at least one player for the playing of the card game comprises in combination housing means having a chute for supporting at least one deck of playing cards for permitting movement of the playing cards one at a time through the chute the housing means having an outlet opening that permits the playing cards of the deck to be moved one by one out of the housing means during the play of a card game card scanning means located within the housing means for scanning indicia located on each of the playing cards as each of the playing cards are moved out from the chute of the housing means means for receiving the output of the card scanning means for identifying each of the playing cards received by each player from the shoe for evaluating information relative to each players received playing cards and their values with information as to playing tactics used by each player relative to the values of the received playing cards and for combining all of this information for identifying each player s playing strategy and a playing table coupled to the card delivery shoe apparatus and having at least one keypad means located thereon for permitting at least one player to select various card playing options to wager upon.

In various embodiments a card playing system for playing a card game which includes a card delivery shoe apparatus for use in dealing playing cards to at least one player for the playing of the card game comprises in combination housing means having a chute for supporting at least one deck of playing cards for permitting movement of the playing cards one at a time through the chute the housing means having an outlet opening that permits the playing cards of the deck to be moved one by one out of the housing means during the play of a card game card scanning means located within the housing means for scanning indicia located on each of the playing cards as each of the playing cards are moved out from the chute of the housing means means for receiving the output of the card scanning means for identifying such of the playing cards received by each player from the shoe apparatus for evaluating information relative to each player s received playing cards and their values with information as to betting tactics used by each player relative to playing cards previously dealt out from the shoe apparatus providing card count information and for combining all of this information for identifying each player s card count strategy and a playing table coupled to the card delivery shoe apparatus and having at least one keypad means located thereon for permitting the at least one player to select at least one of various card playing options to wager upon.

In various embodiments a secure game table system adapted for multiple sites under a central control allows for the monitoring of hands in a progressive live card game. A live card game has at least one deck with each deck having a predetermined number of cards. Each game table in the system has a plurality of player positions with or without players at each position and a dealer at a dealer position.

In one embodiment for providing additional security a common identity code is located on each of the cards in each deck. Each deck has a different common identity code. A shuffler is used to shuffle the decks together and the shuffler has a circuit for counting of the cards from a previous hand that are inserted into the shuffler for reshuffling. The shuffler circuit counts each card inserted and reads the common identity code located on each card. The shuffler circuit issues a signal corresponding to the count and the common identity code read. The game control e.g. the computer located at each table receives this signal from the shuffler circuit and verifies that no cards have been withdrawn from the hand by a player or the dealer or that no new cards have been substituted. If the count is not proper or if a game card lacks an identity code or an identity code is mismatched an alarm signal is generated indicating that a new deck of cards needs to be used and that the possibility of a breach in the security of the game has occurred.

In yet another embodiment of security a unique code such as a bar code is placed on each card and as each card is dealt by the dealer from a shoe a detector reads the code and issues a signal to the game control containing at least the value and the suit of each card dealt in the hand. The detector may also read a common identity deck code and issue that as a signal to the game control. The shoe may have an optical scanner for generating an image of each card as it is dealt from the shoe by the dealer in a hand. The game control stores this information in a memory so that a history of each card dealt from the shoe in a hand is recorded.

In yet another embodiment of security an integrated shuffler shoe obtains an optical image of each card dealt from the shoe for a hand and for each card inserted into the shuffler after a hand. These images are delivered to the game control where the images are counted and compared. When an irregular count or comparison occurs an alarm is raised. The shuffler and shoe are integrated to provide security between the two units.

In another embodiment of security for a live card game a game bet sensor is located near each of the plurality of player positions for sensing the presence of a game bet. The game bet sensor issues a signal counting the tokens placed. It is entirely possible that game bet sensors at some player positions do not have bets and therefore the game control that is receptive of these signals identifies which player positions have players placing game bets. This information is stored in memory and becomes part of the history of the game.

In another embodiment of security a progressive bet sensor is located at each of the plurality of player positions and senses the presence of a progressive bet. The progressive bet sensor issues a signal that is received by the game control which records in memory the progressive bets being placed at the respective player position sensed. If a progressive bet is sensed and a game bet is not the game control issues an alarm signal indicating improper betting. At this point the game control knows the identity of each player location having placed a game bet and of those player positions having game bets placed which player positions also have a progressive bet. This is stored in memory as part of the history of the hand.

In yet another embodiment of security a card sensor is located near each player position and the dealer position. The card sensor issues a signal for each card received at the card sensor. The game control receives this issued signal and correlates those player positions having placed a game bet with the received cards. In the event a player position without a game bet receives a card or a player position with a game bet receives a card out of sequence the game control issues an alarm. This information is added to the history of the game in memory and the history contains the value and suit of each card delivered to each player position having a game bet.

A progressive jackpot display is located at each game table and may display one or more jackpot awards for one or more winning combinations of cards. In various embodiments the game control at each table has stored in memory the winning combinations necessary to win the progressive jackpots. Since the game control accurately stores the suit and value of each card received at a particular player position the game control can automatically detect a winning combination and issue an award signal for that player position. The dealer can then verify that that player at that position indeed has the correct combination of cards. The game control continuously updates the central control interconnected to all other game tables so that the central control can then inform all game tables of this win including if desirable the name of the winner and the amount won.

The central control communicates continuously with each game control and its associated progressive jackpot display may receive over a communication link all or part of the information stored in each game control.

Various embodiments include a card shoe with a device for automatic recognition and tracking of the value of each gaming card drawn out of the card shoe in a covered way face down .

Various embodiments include a gaming table with a device for automatic recognition of played or not played boxes hands whereby it has to realize multiple bets on each hand and the use of insurance lines. Further more the gaming table may include a device to recognize automatically the number of cards placed in front of each player and the dealer.

In various embodiment an electronic data processing EDP program may process the value of all bets on each box and associated insurance line control the sequence of delivery of the cards control the distribution of the gaming cards to each player and the dealer may calculate and compare the total score of each hand and the dealer s and may evaluate the players wins.

Gaming data may then be processed by means of the EDP program and shown simultaneously to the actual game at a special monitor or display. Same data may be recalled later on to monitor the total results whenever requested.

According to various embodiments the card recognition means comprises an optical window arranged along a movement path of the card image imprint on the playing card drawn from the card shoe a pulsed light source for illuminating a portion of the drawn playing card located opposite the optical window a CCD image converter for the portion of the drawn playing card located opposite the optical window an optical device for deflecting and transmitting a reflected image of the card value imprint from the drawn playing card to the CCD image converter from that portion of the drawn playing card when the drawn card is exactly in a correct drawn position opposite the optical window and sensor means for detecting movement of the drawn card and for providing a correct timing for operation of the pulsed light source for transmission of the reflected image to the CCD image converter. The optical device for deflecting and transmitting the reflected image can comprise a minor arranged to deflect the reflected image to the CCD image converter. Alternatively the optical device for deflecting and transmitting the reflected image comprises a reflecting optical prism having two plane surfaces arranged at right angles to each other one of which covers the optical window and another of which faces the CCD image converter and comprises a minor and the pulsed light source is arranged behind the latter plane surface so as to illuminate the drawn card when the drawn card is positioned over the optical window. Advantageously the sensor means for detecting movement of the drawn card and for providing a correct timing comprises a single sensor preferably either a pressure sensor or a photoelectric threshold device for sensing a front edge of the drawn card to determine whether or not the drawn card is being drawn and to activate the CCD image converter and the pulsed light source when a back edge of the drawn card passes the sensor means. Alternatively the sensor means can include two electro optical sensors one of which is located beyond a movement path of the card image imprint on the drawn playing card and another of which is located in a movement path of the card image imprint on a drawn playing card. The latter electro optical sensor can includes means for activating the pulsed light source by sensing a color trigger when the card value imprint passes over the optical window. In preferred embodiments of the card shoe the pulsed light source comprises a Xenon lamp.

In various embodiments of the gaming apparatus the single detectors of the occupation detector unit each comprise a light sensitive sensor for detection of chips or playing cards arranged on the table cloth over the respective single detector. Each single detector can be an infrared sensitive photodiode preferably a silicon photodiode. Advantageously the single detectors can be arranged in the occupation detector unit so that the chips or playing cards placed over them on the table cloth are arrange over at least two single detectors.

The gaming apparatus may includes automatic means for discriminating colored markings or regions on the chips and for producing a bet output signal in accordance with the colored markings or regions and the number of chips having identical colored markings or regions.

The gaming bet detector may include automatic means for discriminating between chips of different value in the game of chance and means for producing a bet output signal in accordance with the different values of the chips when the chips are bet by a player. In various embodiments the gaming bet detector includes a radio frequency transmitting and receiving station and the chips are each provided with a transponder responding to the transmitting and receiving station so that the transponder transmits the values of the bet chips back to the transmitting and receiving station.

The connection between the individual units of the gaming apparatus and the computer can be either a wireless connection or a cable connection.

Various embodiments include a smart card delivery shoe that reads the suit and rank of each card before it is delivered to the various positions where cards are to be dealt in the play of the casino table card game. The cards are then dealt according to the rules of the game to the required card positions. Different games have diverse card distribution positions different card numbers and different delivery sequences that the hand identifying system may encompass in various embodiments. For example in the most complex of card distribution games of blackjack cards are usually dealt one at a time in sequence around a table one card at a time to each player position and then to the dealer position. The one card at a time delivery sequence is again repeated so that each player position and the dealer position have an initial hand of exactly two cards. Complexity in hand development is introduced because players have essentially unlimited control over additional cards until point value in a hand exceeds a count of twenty one. Players may stand with a count of 2 two aces or take a hit with a count of 21 if they are so inclined so the knowledge of the count of a hand is no assurance of what a player will do. The dealer on the other hand is required to follow strict house rules on the play of the game according to the value of the dealer s hand. Small variances such as allowing or disallowing a hit on a soft seventeen count e.g. an Ace and a 6 may exist but the rules are otherwise very precise so that the house or dealer cannot exercise any strategy.

Other cards games may provide equal numbers of cards in batches. Variants of stud poker played against a dealer for example would usually provide hands of five cards five at a time to each player position and if competing against a dealer to the dealer position. This card hand distribution is quite simple to track as each sequence of five cards removed from the dealer shoe is a hand.

Other games may require cards to be dealt to players and other cards dealt to a flop or common card area. The system may also be programmable to cover this alternative if it is so desired.

Baccarat is closer to blackjack in card sequence of dealing but has more rigid rules as to when hits may be taken by the player and the dealer and each position may take a maximum of one card as a hit. The hand identification system according to various embodiments may be able to address the needs of identifying hands in each of these types of games and especially must be able to identify hands in the most complex situation the play of blackjack.

In various embodiments where cameras are used to read cards the light sensitive system may be any image capture system digital or analog that is capable of identifying the suit and rank of a card.

In various embodiments a first step in the operation is to provide a set of cards to the smart delivery shoe the cards being those cards that are going to be used in the play of a casino table card game. The set of cards usually one or more decks is provided in an already randomized set being taken out of a shuffler or having been shuffled by hand. A smart delivery shoe is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 622 321 titled SMART DELIVERY SHOE which application is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Some delivery systems or shoes with reading capability include but are not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 750 743 5 779 546 5 605 334 6 361 044 6 217 447 5 941 769 6 229 536 6 460 848 5 722 893 6 039 650 and 6 126 166 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In various embodiments the cards are read in the smart card delivery shoe such as one card at a time in sequence. Reading cards by edge markings and special codes as in U.S. Pat. No. 6 460 848 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference may require special encoding and marking of the cards. The entire sequence of cards in the set of cards may thus be determined and stored in memory. Memory may be at least in part in the smart delivery shoe but communication with a central processor is possible. The sequence would then also or solely be stored in the central computer.

In various embodiments the cards are then dealt out of the smart delivery shoe the delivery shoe registering how many cards are removed one at a time. This may be accomplished by the above identified U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 622 321 where cards are fed to the dealer removal area one at a time so only one card can be removed by the dealer. As each card is removed a signal is created indicating that a specific card of rank and suit has been dealt. The computer and system knows only that a first card has been dealt and it is presumed to go to the first player. The remaining cards are dealt out to players and dealer. In the play of certain games e.g. stud variants where specific numbers of cards are known to be dealt to each position the shoe may be programmed with the number of players at any time so hands can be correlated even before they have been dealt. If the shoe is playing a stud variant where each player and the dealer gets three cards Three Card Poker game the system may know in advance of the deal what each player and the dealer will have as a hand. It is also possible that there be a signal available when the dealer has received either his first card e.g. when cards are dealt in sequence one at a time or has received his entire hand. The signal may be used to automatically determine the number of player positions active on the table at any given time. For example if in a hand of blackjack the dealer receives the sixth card the system may immediately know that there are five players at the table. The signal can be given manually pressing a button at the dealer position or on the smart card delivery shoe or can be provided automatically a card presence sensor at the dealer s position where a card can be placed over the sensor to provide a signal . Where an automatic signal is provided by a sensor some physical protection of the sensor may be provided such as a shield that would prevent accidental contact with the sensor or blockage of the sensor. An L shaped cover may be used so a card could be slid under the arm of the L parallel to the table surface and cover the sensor under that branch of the L. The signal can also be given after all cards for the hand have been delivered again indicating the number of players For example when the dealer s two cards are slid under the L shaped cover to block or contact the sensor the system may know the total number of cards dealt on the hand e.g. 10 cards know that the dealer has 2 cards determine that players therefore have 8 cards and know that each player has 2 cards each thereby absolutely determining that there are four active player positions at the table 10 2 8 and then 8 2 4 players . This automatic determination may serve as an alternative to having dealers input the number of players each hand at a table or having to manually change the indicated number of players at a table each time the number changes.

Once all active positions have been dealt to the system may now know what cards are initially present in each player s hand the dealer s hand and any flop or common hand. The system operation may now be simple when no more cards are provided to play the casino table game. All hands may then be known and all outcomes may be predicted. The complication of additional cards will be addressed with respect to the game of blackjack.

After dealing the initial set of two cards per hand the system may not immediately know where each remaining card will be dealt. The system may know what cards are dealt however. It is with this knowledge and a subsequent identification of discarded hands that the hands and cards from the smart delivery shoe can be reconciled or verified. Each hand is already identified by the presence of two specifically known cards. Hands are then played according to the rules of the game and hands are discarded when play of a hand is exhausted. A hand is exhausted when 1 there is a blackjack the hand is paid and the cards are cleared 2 a hand breaks with a count over twenty one and the cards are cleared and or a round of the game is played to a conclusion the dealer s hand completed all wagers are settled and the cards are cleared. As is typically done in a casino to enable reconciling of hands manually cards are picked up in a precise order from the table. The cards are usually cleared from the dealer s right to the dealer s left and the cards at each position comprise the cards in the order that they were delivered first card on the bottom second card over the first card third card over the second card etc. maintaining the order or a close approximation of the order e.g. the first two cards may be reversed is important as the first two cards form an anchor focus basis fence end point or set edge for each hand. For example if the third player position was known to have received the 10 of hearts 10H and the 9 of spades 9S for the first two card and the fourth player was known to receive the 8 of diamonds 8D and the 3 of clubs 3C for the first two cards the edges or anchors of the two hands are 9S 10H and 8D 3C. When the hands are swept at the conclusion of the game the cards are sent to a smart discard rack e.g. see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 622 388 which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and the hand with the 9S 10H was not already exhausted e.g. broken or busted and the swept cards consist of 9S 10H 8S 8D and 3C as read by the smart discard rack the software of the processor may automatically know that the final hands in the third and fourth positions were a count of 19 9S and 10H for the third hand and 19 8D and 3C originally plus the 8S hit for the fourth hand. The analysis by the software specifically identifies the fourth hand as a count of 19 with the specific cards read by the smart discard shoe. The information from reading that now exhausted hand is compared with the original information collected from the smart delivery shoe. The smart delivery shoe information when combined with the smart discard rack information shall confirm the hands in each position even though cards were not uniformly distributed e.g. player one takes two hits for a total of four cards player two takes three hits for a total of five cards player three takes no hit for a total of two cards player four takes one hit for a total of three cards and the dealer takes two hits for a total of four cards .

The dealer s cards may be equally susceptible to analysis in a number of different formats. After the last card has been dealt to the last player a signal may be easily and imperceptibly generated that the dealer s hand will now become active with possible hits. For example with the sensor described above for sensing the presence of the first dealer card or the completion of the dealer s hand the cards would be removed from beneath the L shaped protective bridge. This type of movement is ordinarily done in blackjack where the dealer has at most a single card exposed and one card buried face down. In this case the removal of the cards from over the sensor underneath the L cover to display the hole card is a natural movement and then exposes the sensor. This can provide a signal to the central processor that the dealer s hand will be receiving all additional cards in that round of the game. The system at this point knows the two initial cards in the dealer s hand knows the values of the next sequence of cards and knows the rules by which a dealer must play. The system knows what cards the dealer will receive and what the final total of the dealer s hand will be because the dealer has no freedom of decision or movement in the play of the dealer s hand. When the dealer s hand is placed into the smart discard rack the discard rack already knows the specifics of the dealer s hand even without having to use the first two cards as an anchor or basis for the dealer s hand. The cards may be treated in this manner in some embodiments.

When the hands are swept from the table dealer s hand then players hands from right to left from the dealer s position or vice versa if that is the manner of house play the smart discard rack reads the shoes identifies the anchors for each hand knows that no hands swept at the conclusion can exceed a count of twenty one and the computer identifies the individual hands and reconciles them with the original data from the smart delivery shoe. The system thereby can identify each hand played and provide system assurance that the hand was played fairly and accurately.

If a lack of reconciling by the system occurs a number of events can occur. A signal can be given directly to the dealer position to the pit area or to a security zone and the cards examined to determine the nature and cause of the error and inspect individual cards if necessary. When the hand and card data is being used for various statistical purposes such as evaluating dealer efficiency dealer win loss events player efficiency player win loss events statistical habits of players unusual play tactics or meaningful play tactics e.g. indicative of card counting and the like the system may file the particular hand in a dump file so that hand is not used in the statistical analysis this is to assure that maximum benefits of the analysis are not tilted by erroneous or anomalous data.

Various embodiments may include date stamping of each card dealt actual time and date defining sequence with concept of specific identification of sequence identifier possibly being unique . The date stamping may also be replaced by specific sequence stamping or marking such as a specific hand number at a specific table at a specific casino with a specific number of players etc. The records could indicate variations of indicators in the stored memory of the central computer of Lucky 777 Casino Aug. 19 1995 8 12 17 a.m. Table 3 position 3 hand 7S 4D 9S or simply identify something similar by alphanumeric code as L7C 819 95 3 3 073 7S 4D 9S 073 being the 73hand dealt . This date stamping of hands or even cards in memory can be used as an analytical search tool for security and to enhance hand identification.

The use of the discard rack acting to reconcile hands returned to the discard rack out of order e.g. blackjack or bust automatically may be advantageous in some embodiments. The software as described above can be programmed to recognize hands removed out of dealing order on the basis of knowledge of the anchor cards the first two cards known to have been dealt to a specific hand. For example the software will identify that when a blackjack was dealt to position three that hand will be removed the feed of the third hand into the smart card discard tray confirms this and position three will essentially be ignored in future hand resolution. More importantly when the anchor cards were for example 9S 5C in the second player position and an exhausted hand of 8D 9S 5C is placed into the smart discard rack that hand will be identified as the hand from the second player position. If two identical hands happen to be dealt in the same round of play the software will merely be alerted it knows all of the hands to specifically check the final order of cards placed into the smart discard rack to more carefully position the location of that exhausted hand. This is merely recognition software implementation once the concept is understood.

That the step of removal of cards from the dealer s sensor or other initiated signal identifies that all further cards are going to the dealer may be useful in defining the edges of play between rounds and in identifying the dealer s hand and the end of a round of play. When the dealer s cards are deposited and read in the smart discard rack the central computer knows that another round of play is to occur and a mark or note may be established that the following sequence will be a new round and the analytical cycle may begin all over again.

The discard rack indicates that a complete hand has been delivered by absence of additional cards in the Discard Rack in feed tray. When cards are swept from an early exhausted hand blackjack or a break they are swept one at a time and inserted into the smart discard rack one at a time. When the smart discard rack in feed tray is empty the system understands that a complete hand has been identified and the system can reconcile that specific hand with the information from the smart delivery shoe. The system can be hooked up to feed strategy analysis software programs such as the SMI licensed proprietary Bloodhound analysis program.

Various embodiments include a casino or cardroom game modified to include a progressive jackpot component. During the play of a Twenty One game for example in addition to this normal wager a player will have the option of making an additional wager that becomes part of and makes the player eligible to win the progressive jackpot. If the player s Twenty One hand comprises a particular predetermined arrangement of cards the player will win all or part of the amount showing on the progressive jackpot. This progressive jackpot feature is also adaptable to any other casino or cardroom game such as Draw Poker Stud Poker Lo Ball Poker or Caribbean Stud Poker. Various embodiments include a gaming table such as those used for Twenty One or poker modified with the addition of a coin acceptor that is electronically connected to a progressive jackpot meter. When player drops a coin into the coin acceptor a light is activated at the player s location indicating that he is participating in the progressive jackpot component of the game during that hand. At the same time a signal from the coin acceptor is sent to the progressive meter to increment the amount shown on the progressive meter. At the conclusion of the play of each hand the coin acceptor is reset for the next hand. When a player wins all or part of the progressive jackpot the amount showing on the progressive jackpot meter is reduced by the amount won by the player. Any number of gaming tables can be connected to a single progressive jackpot meter.

Various embodiments include an automatic card shuffler including a card mixer for receiving cards to be shuffled in first and second trays. Sensors detect the presence of cards in these trays to automatically initiate a shuffling operation in which the cards are conveyed from the trays to a card mixer which randomly interleaves the cards delivered to the mixing mechanism and deposits the interleaved cards in a vertically aligned card compartment.

A carriage supporting an ejector is reciprocated back and forth in a vertical direction by a reversible linear drive while the cards are being mixed to constantly move the card ejector along the card receiving compartment. The reversible linear drive is preferably activated upon activation of the mixing means and operates simultaneously with but independently of the mixing means. When the shuffling operation is terminated the linear drive is deactivated thereby randomly positioning the card ejector at a vertical location along the card receiving compartment.

A sensor arranged within the card receiving compartment determines if the stack of cards has reached at least a predetermined vertical height. After the card ejector has stopped and if the sensor in the compartment determines that the stack of cards has reached at least the aforesaid predetermined height a mechanism including a motor drive is activated to move the wedge shaped card ejector into the card receiving compartment for ejecting a group of the cards in the stack the group selected being determined by the vertical position attained by the wedge shaped card ejector.

In various embodiments the card ejector pushes the group of cards engaged by the ejector outwardly through the forward open end of the compartment said group of cards being displaced from the remaining cards of the stack but not being completely or fully ejected from the stack.

The card ejector upon reaching the end of its ejection stroke detected by a microswitch is withdrawn from the card compartment and returned to its initial position in readiness for a subsequent shuffling and card selecting operation.

In various embodiments a technique for randomly selecting the group of cards to be ejected from the card compartment utilizes solid state electronic circuit means which may comprise either a group of discrete solid state circuits or a microprocessor either of which techniques preferably employ a high frequency generator for stepping a N stage counter during the shuffling operation. When the shuffling operation is completed the stepping of the counter is terminated. The output of the counter is converted to a DC signal which is compared against another DC signal representative of the vertical location of the card ejector along the card compartment.

In various embodiments a random selection is made by incrementing the N stage counter with a high frequency generator. The high frequency generator is disconnected from the N stage counter upon termination of the shuffling operation. The N stage counter is then incremented by a very low frequency generator until it reaches its capacity count and resets. The reciprocating movement of the card ejector is terminated after completion of a time interval of random length and extending from the time the high frequency generator is disconnected from the N stage counter to the time that the counter is advanced to its capacity count and reset by the low frequency generator triggering the energization of the reciprocating drive at which time the card ejector carriage coasts to a stop.

In various embodiments the card ejector partially ejects a group of cards from the stack in the compartment. The partially displaced group of cards is then manually removed from the compartment. In another preferred embodiment the ejector fully ejects the group of cards from the compartment the ejected cards being dropped into a chute which delivers the cards directly to a dealing shoe. The pressure plate of the dealing shoe is initially withdrawn to a position enabling the cards passing through the delivery shoe to enter directly into the dealing shoe and is thereafter returned to its original position at which it urges the cards towards the output end of the dealing shoe.

Various embodiments include a method and apparatus for automatically shuffling and cutting playing cards and delivering shuffled and cut playing cards to the dispensing shoe without any human intervention whatsoever once the playing cards are delivered to the shuffling apparatus. In addition the shuffling operation may be performed as soon as the play of each game is completed if desired and simultaneously with the start of a new game thus totally eliminating the need to shuffle all of the playing cards which may include six or eight decks for example at one time. Preferably the cards played are collected in a dead box and are drawn from the dead box when an adequate number of cards have been accumulated for shuffling and cutting using the methods according to various embodiments.

Various embodiments include a computer controlled shuffling and cutting system provided with a housing having at least one transparent wall making the shuffling and card delivery mechanism easily visible to all players and floor management in casino applications. The housing is provided with a reciprocally slidable playing card pusher which in the first position is located outside of said housing. A motor operated transparent door selectively seals and uncovers an opening in the transparent wall to permit the slidably mounted card pusher to be moved from its aforementioned first position to a second position inside the housing whereupon the slidably mounted card pusher is then withdrawn to the first position whereupon the playing cards have been deposited upon a motorized platform which moves vertically and selectively in the upward and downward directions.

The motor driven transparent door is lifted to the uncovered position responsive to the proper location of the motor driven platform detected by suitable sensor means as well as depression of a foot or hand operated button accessible to the dealer.

The motor driven platform or elevator lifts the stack of playing cards deposited therein upwardly toward a shuffling mechanism responsive to removal of the slidably mounted card pusher and closure of the transparent door whereupon the playing cards are driven by the shuffling mechanism in opposing directions and away from the stack to first and second card holding magazines positioned on opposing sides of the elevator said shuffling mechanism comprising motor driven rollers rotatable upon a reciprocating mounting device the reciprocating speed and roller rotating speed being adjustable. Alternatively however the reciprocating and rotating speeds may be fixed if desired employing motors having fixed output speeds in place of the stepper motors employed in one preferred embodiment.

Upon completion of a shuffling operation the platform is lowered and the stacks of cards in each of the aforementioned receiving compartments are sequentially pushed back onto the moving elevator by suitable motor driven pushing mechanisms. The order of operation of the pushing mechanisms is made random by use of a random numbers generator employed in the operating computer for controlling the system. These operations can be repeated if desired. Typically new cards undergo these operations from two to four times.

Guide assemblies guide the movement of cards onto the platform prevent shuffled cards from being prematurely returned to the elevator platform and align the cards as they fall into the card receiving regions as well as when they are pushed back onto the elevator platform by the motor driven pushing mechanism.

Upon completion of the plurality of shuffling and cutting operations the platform is again lowered causing the shuffled and cut cards to be moved downwardly toward a movable guide plate having an inclined guide surface.

As the motor driven elevator moves downwardly between the guide plates the stack of cards engages the inclined guide surface of a substantially U shaped secondary block member causing the stack to be shifted from a horizontal orientation to a diagonal orientation. Substantially simultaneously therewith a drawbridge like assembly comprised of a pair of swingable arms pivotally mounted at their lower ends are swung downwardly about their pivot pin from a vertical orientation to a diagonal orientation and serve as a diagonally aligned guide path. The diagonally aligned stack of cards slides downwardly along the inclined guide surfaces and onto the draw bridge like arms and are moved downwardly therealong by the U shaped secondary block member under control of a stepper motor to move cards toward and ultimately into the dealing shoe.

A primary block with a paddle then moves between the cut away portion of the U shaped secondary block thus applying forward pressure to the stack of cards. The secondary block then retracts to the home position. The paddle is substantially rectangular shaped and is aligned in a diagonal orientation. Upon initial set up of the system the paddle is positioned above the path of movement of cards into the dealing shoe. The secondary block moves the cut and shuffled cards into the dealing shoe and the paddle is lowered to the path of movement of cards toward the dealing shoe and is moved against the rearwardmost card in the stack of cards delivered to the dealing shoe. When shuffling and cutting operations are performed subsequent to the initial set up the paddle rests against the rearwardmost card previously delivered to the dealing shoe. The shuffled and cut cards sliding along the guide surfaces of the diagonally aligned arms of the draw bridge like mechanism come to rest upon the opposite surface of the paddle which serves to isolate the playing cards previously delivered to the dispensing shoe as well as providing a slight pushing force urging the cards toward the outlet slot of the dispensing shoe thereby enabling the shuffling and delivering operations to be performed simultaneously with the dispensing of playing cards from the dispensing shoe.

After all of the newly shuffled playing cards have been delivered to the rear end of the dispensing shoe by means of the U shaped secondary block the paddle which is sandwiched between two groups of playing cards is lifted to a position above and displaced from the playing cards. A movable paddle mounting assembly is then moved rearwardly by a motor to place the paddle to the rear of the rearmost playing card just delivered to the dispensing shoe and the paddle is lowered to its home position whereupon the motor controlling movement of the paddle assembly is then deenergized enabling the rollingly mounted assembly supporting the paddle to move diagonally downwardly as playing cards are dispensed from the dispensing shoe to provide a force which is sufficient to urge the playing cards forwardly toward the playing card dispensing slot of the dealing shoe. The force acting upon the paddle assembly is the combination of gravity and a force exerted upon the paddle assembly by a constant tension spring assembly. Jogging i.e. dither means cause the paddle to be jogged or reciprocated in opposing forward and rearward directions at periodic intervals to assure appropriate alignment stacking and sliding movement of the stack of playing cards toward the card dispensing slot of the dealing shoe.

Upon completion of a game the cards used in the completed game are typically collected by the dealer and placed in a dead box on the table. The collected cards are later placed within the reciprocally movable card pusher. The dealer has the option of inserting the cards within the reciprocally slidable card pusher into the shuffling mechanism or alternatively and preferably may postpone a shuffling operation until a greater number of cards have been collected upon the reciprocally slidable card pusher. The shuffling and delivery operations may be performed as often or as infrequently as the dealer or casino management may choose. The shuffling and playing card delivery operations are fully automatic and are performed without human intervention as soon as cards are inserted within the machine on the elevator platform. The cards are always within the unobstructed view of the players to enable the players as well as the dealer to observe and thereby be assured that the shuffling cutting and card delivery operations are being performed properly and without jamming and that the equipment is working properly as well. The shuffling and card delivery operations do not conflict or interfere with the dispensing of cards from the dispensing shoe thereby permitting these operations to be performed substantially simultaneously thus significantly reducing the amount of time devoted to shuffling and thereby greatly increasing the playing time as well as providing a highly efficient random shuffling and cutting mechanism.

The system is controlled by a microcomputer programmed to control the operations of the card shuffling and cutting system. The computer controls stepper motors through motor drive circuits intelligent controllers and an opto isolator linking the intelligent controllers to the computer. The computer also monitors a plurality of sensors to assure proper operation of each of the mechanisms of the system.

Some methods of thwarting card counters include using a large number of decks. Shoes containing 6 or 8 decks are common. The more cards there are the less variation there is in the proportions of the remaining cards and the harder it is to count them. The player s advantage can also be reduced by shuffling the cards more frequently but this reduces the amount of time that can be devoting to actual play and therefore reduces the casino profits. Some casinos now use shuffling machines some of which shuffle one set of cards while another is in play while others continuously shuffle the cards. The distractions of the gaming floor environment and complimentary alcoholic beverages also act to thwart card counters. Some methods of thwarting card counters include using varied payoff structures such Blackjack payoff of 6 5 which is more disadvantageous to the player than the standard 3 2 Blackjack payoff.

Video wagering games are set up to mimic a table game using adaptations of table games rules and cards.

In one version of video poker the player is allowed to inspect five cards randomly chosen by the computer. These cards are displayed on the video screen and the player chooses which cards if any that he or she wishes to hold. If the player wishes to hold all of the cards i.e. stand he or she presses a STAND button. If the player wishes to hold only some of the cards he or she chooses the cards to be held by pressing HOLD keys located directly under each card displayed on the video screen. Pushing a DEAL button after choosing the HOLD cards automatically and simultaneously replaces the unchosen cards with additional cards which are randomly selected from the remainder of the deck. After the STAND button is pushed or the cards are replaced the final holding is evaluated by the game machine s computer and the player is awarded either play credits or a coin payout as determined from a payoff table. This payoff table is stored in the machine s computer memory and is also displayed on the machine s screen. Hands with higher poker values are awarded more credits or coins. Very rare poker hands are awarded payoffs of 800 to 1 or higher.

It will be understood that the technologies described herein for making using or practicing various embodiments are but a subset of the possible technologies that may be used for the same or similar purposes. The particular technologies described herein are not to be construed as limiting. Rather various embodiments contemplate alternate technologies for making using or practicing various embodiments.

The following patents and patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes 

In various embodiments a secondary player may include a person who places bets on the games of other people primary players but does not directly participate in the game himself. The secondary player may thus be remote from the place where a game is actually played. The secondary player may nevertheless view information about the game such as from a video feed. A secondary player may also play in games of his own using the outcomes generated at the games of primary players.

In various embodiments a player such as a secondary player may engage in gaming activities using a station workstation or terminal that has multiple displays. The displays may be monitors. The displays may include liquid crystal displays LCDs plasma screens cathode ray tube displays or any other displays. The terminal may include various other components. One or more keyboards may include buttons touch pads or other devices for receiving inputs from a secondary player. The keyboard may have dedicated keys with certain functions such as shortcut functions. The terminal may include an audio communication channel such as a telephone an internet connection that supports voice or any other communications channel. The terminal may include one or more touch screens. Touch screens may correspond to display screens. shows a terminal according to various embodiments.

In various embodiments a player at a terminal may play in a game as a primary player. For example the player may play in a game of Texas Hold em poker or in a game of Blackjack. Video or images of his opponents may appear on various screens of the terminal. In some embodiments each screen may contain an image or video of a different one of the player s opponents.

In various embodiments a player e.g. a primary player whose turn it is to act in a game may be prominently featured at a terminal. A player whose turn it is to act may have his image placed on a center screen on a terminal. If videos or images of multiple players are shown the image of the player to act may be enlarged highlighted made more bright than images of the other players or otherwise emphasized.

In various embodiments avatars for players e.g. for primary players may be shown on the display screens of terminals. For example a video or image of a primary player may not be available or the primary player may wish that a video of him not be shown. Thus an avatar or other representation of a primary player may be shown on the display screens of a terminal. Where a player acts as a primary player at a terminal avatars for his opponents may be shown on display screens of the terminal.

determining that the placement of the phone call to the destination is in compliance with the set of rules and

displaying graphics associated with the second game on a second display screen in which graphics associated with the second game are displayed simultaneously to the display of the graphics associated with the first game 

For example the second player may be a primary player and the first player may participate in the game of the primary player as a secondary player. At the same time the first player may play the first game as a primary player. Thus the first player may simultaneously act as both a primary player and a secondary player. It should be recognized that while various example embodiments are described in terms of a separate primary and secondary player that in some embodiments a secondary player and a primary player may be a same player. For example a player may choose to play a copy of a hand dealt to the player e.g. take a same original hand in multiple different directions .

In some embodiments a primary player may directly participate in a game of chance. The primary player may place a bet make game decisions roll dice e.g. if the game is a game of craps and receive winnings and losses based on his bet his decisions and events e.g. random events that occur during the game. In some embodiments a secondary player may place bets on games played by a primary player. The secondary player may bet that certain outcomes will occur that certain decisions will be made that certain cards will be dealt that certain numbers will be rolled in a game of dice or that any other event will occur. The secondary player may be removed from the physical location of the game. The secondary player may be uninvolved with any decisions made during the game. A secondary player may participate in a game via a remote terminal mobile gaming device or other device. For example a secondary player may use a terminal with buttons and a monitor to input bets and to watch the progress of a game.

In various embodiments a secondary player may view data or information about games in which the secondary player may participate e.g. about games on which the secondary player can bet . The secondary player may view different types of data may view data in various ways or presentation formats may sort the data in different ways may search through the data in various ways may filter the data in various ways and may otherwise view and interact with data about games in various ways.

In some embodiments a player may watch the progress of a game together with other information. The other information may be information that was not present in the original footage. For example the casino server may add to the game footage text indicating a probability of a certain final outcome occurring text indicating the name of a player text indicating what happened the last time a similar intermediate outcome occurred e.g. text indicating what happened the last time a primary player drew to a royal flush or any other text overlay.

3.2. Simulation. In some embodiments a secondary player may watch the progress of a game via a simulation. The simulation may be a simulated reenactment of the game. The reenactment may feature the dealing of animated cards and the placement of bets by animated hands holding animated chips. The simulation may show actual indicia which have occurred or are occurring in a game. The simulation may shown an animated spinning of slot machine reels the animated roll of dice or the animated spinning of a roulette wheel for example.

In some embodiments a secondary player may specify criteria for a game in which he wishes to participate. The casino server may find a first game satisfying the criteria and allow the secondary player to participate in the game. The secondary player may then continue to participate in games having something in common with the first game such as in games played by the same primary player as the first game such as in games played at the same gaming device as the first game such as in games played at the same gaming table as the first game such as in games played by the same dealers as the first game and so on. At some point the casino server may determine that the games in which the secondary player will participate e.g. if he keeps participating in the games of the same primary player e.g. if he keeps participating in games at the same gaming table will no longer meet the original criteria set forth by the secondary player. At this point the secondary player may be switched so that he is now participating in games that do meet his original criteria. In various embodiments a secondary player may specify whether he wishes to be switched from participating in a first set of games e.g. from participating in a games of a first primary player to participating in a second set of games e.g. to participating in the games of a second primary player . The secondary player may indicate a desire to be switched when he originally specifies criteria for participating in games. For example a secondary player may specify that he wishes to participate in the games of a first primary player who has the highest net winnings of any primary player over the last hour. The secondary player may further specify that the moment a different primary player overtakes the first primary player in terms of having the highest net winnings in the last hour the secondary player would like stop participating in the games of the first primary player and begin participating in the games of the new different primary player.

In various embodiments when the games in which a secondary player is participating no longer satisfy the criteria specified by the secondary player for participating in games the secondary player may be switched to new games automatically. For example the secondary player may be automatically switched from participating in the games at a first table to participating in the games at a second table. In some embodiments the secondary player is informed of this switch. For example a message may pop up on the screen of the secondary player s display. The message may say You are now participating in games at Blackjack table 6 where player net winnings over the last hour are the highest of any table. In some embodiments the secondary player may not even be informed of a switch. Rather the secondary player may continue to see a reenactment of games without realizing the games are originating from a different gaming table. In some embodiments though a secondary player may not be told explicitly of a switch e.g. via a pop up message ways may be available for the secondary player to surmise that a switch has occurred. For example a display screen on which the secondary player is watching a simulated reenactment of a blackjack game may include a table identifier in the lower right hand corner. When the secondary player is switched from participating in the games of a first table to participating in the games of a second table the table number in the lower right hand corner may change.

In some embodiments a secondary player may be asked for an input in relation to a potential switch. For example a message may be displayed for the secondary player indicating that the secondary player is to be switched from participating in a first set of games to participating in a second set of games. The secondary player may be asked whether he would really like to be switched or whether he would like to remain a participant in the first set of games. The secondary player may be informed of the reason for the switch. For example the secondary player may be informed that he is being switched because the second set of games better match his criteria for participating in games than do the first set of games.

In various embodiments a secondary player may not provide an indication that he would want to switch from a first set of games to a second set of games. The secondary player may only specify criteria for selecting games in which to participate. The casino server may in various embodiments determine at some point that a second set of games better matches the secondary player s criteria for participating in games than does the set of games in which the secondary player is currently participating. Thus the casino server may ask the secondary player whether he would like to switch and participate in the second set of games. The question may be asked though the secondary player never before indicated an interest in switching. The secondary player may then have an opportunity to accept or not.

In various embodiments a secondary player may be rotated from game to game according to some algorithm. For example after every 50 games of a first gaming device in which a secondary player participates the secondary player may be automatically moved to a second gaming device of the same type e.g. featuring the same game . In various embodiments after a certain patterns of wins or losses a secondary player may be rotated to another gaming device game table or primary player. For example if a secondary player loses five games in a row while participating in the games of a first primary player the secondary player may be automatically rotated to the games of another primary player. In some embodiments a secondary player may be asked to confirm his approval before being rotated to a new game.

In various embodiments a secondary player may wish to participate in a game with a certain characteristic. The secondary player may wish to participate in a game with a certain primary player in a game at a certain gaming table in a game at a certain gaming device in a game with a certain betting limit in a game with a certain jackpot in a game made by a particular manufacturer in a game that follows X consecutive wins in a game that follows X consecutive losses or in a game with any other characteristic. However a game that conforms to the desires of the secondary player may not be immediately available for the secondary player to participate in. For example there may be no primary player who is playing a particular gaming device whose games the secondary player wishes to participate in. Thus in various embodiments a secondary player may be alerted when a game that meets some criteria becomes available. The criteria may include criteria that secondary player has previously used to find a game in which to participate. For example if no primary player is currently playing at a gaming device in whose games the secondary player wishes to participate the secondary player may be alerted when a primary player does sit down at the gaming device.

In various embodiments a pattern of betting may be determined for a player such as for a primary player or for a secondary player. A pattern of betting may entail any system of rules tendencies criteria or other factors used by a player in placing a bet or series of bets.

A pattern of betting may describe or encapsulate a first player s tendency to a bet on a particular second player b bet on only the house e.g. in a game of blackjack or roulette c bet on only the player position e.g. in a game where a house plays against the player d double a bet after a loss e change a bet size under particular circumstances f bet only on a particular type of outcome e.g. bet only on red in roulette e.g. bet only on the pass line in craps g employ a particular strategy in a game h bet on a particular type of second player e.g. a first player s betting pattern may be to always bet on a second player who has won more than 100 in the last 10 minutes and or any other tendency.

A first player s pattern of betting may include the tendency to always bet on another player e.g. on a primary player who is the top performing player in the last hour. A first player s pattern of betting may include the tendency to always use optimal strategy in a game of blackjack. A first player s pattern of betting may include the tendency to bet on a second player only when the second player plays a particular game such as blackjack. A first player s pattern of betting may include the tendency to bet on a second player only when the second player is on a winning streak.

In various embodiments a pattern of betting may be exhibited by either a primary player or by a secondary player. A secondary player may exhibit a pattern of betting for example in the way he chooses primary players on which to bet. The secondary player may tend to choose primary players of a particular age occupation or skill level for example. A secondary player may tend to bet on a particular primary player e.g. Bob Smith or the secondary player may tend to bet on a primary player with a certain game history e.g. a primary player with the most money won in the last hour . A secondary player may tend to bet on any primary player that happens to be seated in a particular spot at a gaming table e.g. at the spot just to the left of the dealer . Any tendency used by a secondary player to choose primary players on which to bet may constitute a pattern of betting.

In various embodiments any tendency used by a player in choosing which games to play or bet on may constitute a pattern of betting. For example a tendency of a player to bet only on blackjack may constitute a pattern of betting. A tendency of a player to bet only on slot machine games may constitute a pattern of betting.

In various embodiments a tendency of a player to play games at a particular time may constitute a pattern of betting. For example the tendency of the player to always play games between 1 00 pm and 2 00 pm may constitute a pattern of betting.

In various embodiments a pattern of betting may constitute an alternating or varying pattern. For example a secondary player may have the tendency to alternate between betting on the dealer and betting on a primary player in a game of blackjack.

In various embodiments a pattern of betting that has been determined or deduced need not necessarily fit every bet that has been made by a particular player. For example out of 1000 bets made by a player a set of rules made to describe such bets may explain 900 of those bets but may fail to explain the remaining 100.

In various embodiments bets made by a player may be recorded e.g. by a gaming device or a terminal where such bets are placed. Bets may also be recorded by an information capturing device such as a scanner or camera.

Bets made by a player may be analyzed for patterns of betting. The central server may for example employ statistical algorithms to deduce rules or tendencies of the player in placing bets. A betting pattern may take the form of a set of rules. For example each rule may specify one or more conditions and an action to be taken if the conditions are true. For example a rule may state that if the last game of a first player was a win then the first player should bet twice the amount of his previous bet on the next game he will play. As another example a rule may state that a first player should place a bet on the player at a particular blackjack table who has won the most money in the last five hands e.g. the first player should bet that such a player will win again .

Once patterns of betting have been determined such patterns may be made available for use by other players. Other players may then have the opportunity to follow the same patterns in their own betting practices. For example a first player may follow the same pattern of betting used by a second player.

A pattern of betting may be made available in a number of forms. A first player may be able to view a list of rules that would allow the first player to follow the pattern. A first player may be able to view a text description of the pattern. A first player may be able to view suggestions of what to do in a given situation e.g. suggestions of how much to make or which strategy decision to make where such suggestions are made in accordance with a pattern of betting.

In various embodiments a first player may indicate a desire to automatically follow a pattern of betting used by a second player. Thus the first player may authorize a gaming device the central server or some other device to automatically place bets on his behalf or to automatically employ a particular game strategy on his behalf in accordance with the betting patterns of a second player. The first player may then sit back and watch games unfold without providing any further input.

In various embodiments a first player may receive information about what bet he should make or what strategy he should use next if he wishes to follow a pattern of betting of a second player. However the first player may be given the opportunity to manually confirm or enter e.g. via the press of a button his own bet so that the first player has the opportunity but not the obligation to follow the betting pattern of the second player.

In various embodiments a first player may copy some aspects of a second player s pattern of betting but not all aspects. For example a first player may copy the second player s strategy but not his pattern of varying the bet sizes. As another example a first player may copy the betting patterns of a second player but only when the second player is playing blackjack. As another example a first player may copy the betting patterns of the second player but only between the hours of 2 00 pm and 3 00 pm. As another example a first player may copy the betting pattern of a second player but only when the first player is ahead by more than a certain amount of money. As another example a first player may copy the betting pattern of a second player but only when the second player is ahead by more than a certain amount of money.

In various embodiments a first player may search for a second player with certain characteristics. For example a first player may search for a second player who has won more than any other player playing blackjack. The first player may then choose to copy the betting patterns of the second player. In various embodiments a first player may periodically alter the betting patterns which he follows depending on some criteria. For example the first player may always follow the betting pattern of the second player who is most ahead at the moment. Thus as different players win money and become the player with the most winnings at a casino a first player may change the betting pattern he follows.

In various embodiments a first player may follow the betting pattern of a second player so long as that second player is still following the same betting pattern. If the second player starts using a different betting pattern or makes bets that are inconsistent with the first betting pattern then the first player may cease following the betting pattern of the second player.

In various embodiments following a betting pattern need not include making the exact same bets as another player. Rather a first player may employ the same rules for making bets that a second player uses but may employ those rules on a different game.

In various embodiments a player may wish to employ a pattern of betting. The pattern employed may be a pattern that had previously been used by a second player or that had previously been used by a number of other players. The player may wish to know various statistics about the pattern. For example the player may wish to know how successful the pattern has been or how many other players have used the same pattern in the past. Knowing statistics about a pattern of betting may allow a player to decide whether or not to use the pattern and or whether or not to choose a first pattern of betting over a second pattern of betting.

In various embodiments a casino server or other device or entity may track the games played the amounts bet the strategies used and any other information about one or more players. The casino server may use the collected information to determine betting patterns and to determine statistics about the betting patterns. The casino may determine how many players are using a particular pattern. The casino may determine how many players are using a particular pattern over a particular time interval e.g. over a ten minute period . The casino server may also determine how many players have used a particular pattern at all e.g. in the last day. The casino server may determine the percentage of time that a particular pattern of betting has been used as opposed to other patterns of betting. For example a casino server may determine that 20 of the time when any player engages in play at the casino the player employs a particular pattern of betting.

In various embodiments a casino may determine statistics or metrics about the success of a pattern. For example the casino may determine which patterns of betting have resulted in the most money won for players which patterns have resulted in the most won games for players which patterns have been profitable for the longest amounts of time and or any other metrics about a pattern. A casino may determine which pattern has been successful over the most recent time period or during the current time period. For example in some embodiments a casino may determine all the patterns of betting that are currently being employed by players across the casino or by a particular subset of players e.g. by blackjack players . The casino may then determine which pattern is or has been the most successful according to some metric.

Upon request of a player or without any particular request a casino may display statistics about different patterns of betting. For example the casino may periodically rank and re rank patterns of betting according to which has been the most successful e.g. which has generated the most winning per player using the pattern over the most recent time period. A player may have the opportunity to view statistics about a pattern of betting and to use such statistics for example to aid in his decision of whether or not to copy the pattern of betting himself.

In various embodiments a first player may wish to be alerted or informed about a pattern of betting that is being used by a second player. The second player may be a successful player for example. The first player may in particular wish to be alerted when the second player switches his pattern of betting. For example the first player may copy a first pattern of betting from the second player. However if the second player switches to using a second pattern of betting then the first player may decide to stop using the first pattern of betting and perhaps to switch to the second pattern of betting.

In various embodiments a gaming device may initiate and or conduct a series of games for a player in an automatic fashion. During the series of games no player input may be required. Prior to the series of games the player may describe rules or parameters according to which the games will be played. The player may thereby configure the gaming device to use these rules or parameters. The parameters may include a the number of games to be played b the time to play each game c the time to play the whole series of games d the amount to wager on each game e the strategy to be used in each game f a criterion or criteria for when to stop playing automatically g a criterion or criteria for when to seek player input h the type or types of games to be played i the gaming device or devices to be used for conducting the game e.g. for generating game outcomes j the manner in which outcomes will be communicated to the player e.g. the outcomes may be displayed e.g. the outcomes may be printed on a paper for the player or any other parameters.

In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured to use a particular strategy for a particular period of time. The particular strategy may be an optimal strategy. In various embodiments a strategy may be optimal in the sense that it maximizes a player s expected winnings for a game once the game has been started. The particular strategy may be a strategy which allows for the highest possible payout. For example in a game of video poker one strategy may be to always pursue the royal flush. In various embodiments a player may configure a gaming device to play optimal strategy for the next ten minutes. In various embodiments a player may configure a gaming device to play blackjack using basic strategy for the next 20 minutes.

In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured with a frequency of play. For example the gaming device may be configured to play 10 games per minute. A gaming device may similarly be configured to have a particular period of time between games. For example a gaming device may be configured to initiate each new game ten seconds after the last game was initiated. A gaming device may be configured to play a game of a certain length. For example a slot machine may be configured so that the reels take 10 seconds before they stop spinning.

In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured to play for some length of time. For example the gaming device may be configured to conduct games for the next 45 minutes. In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured to play games until some amount of money is won or lost. For example a gaming device may start with a player bankroll of 50. The gaming device may be configured to keep playing until either the bankroll reaches 75 and thereby 25 has been won or until the bankroll reaches 25 and thereby 25 has been lost . In various embodiments the gaming device may cease playing even though an amount won or lost or a bankroll has not reached an exact threshold. For example having started at 50 a bankroll may reach 25.50 at a dollar denomination machine. The machine may stop playing because one further bet would risk leaving the bankroll at 24.50 which is below the lower limit for which the gaming device has been configured.

In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured to play optimal strategy for some percentage of the games played. For example a gaming device may be configured to play optimal strategy in 80 of games played. Thus for example the gaming device may randomly determine for each game whether it will use optimal strategy. If random determination may be made such that there is an 80 likelihood that optimal strategy will be used e.g. there is a biased drawing made to determine whether optimal strategy will be used. In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured to play optimal strategy for some percent of the time. For example for the first 60 of a period of time during which a gaming device is playing automatically optimal strategy may be used. For the remaining 40 of the time some non optimal strategy may be used. In various embodiments using a strategy that is not optimal does not necessarily mean that a gaming device won t make the same decision that would have been made had it been using optimal strategy. In various embodiments two different strategies may sometimes yield the same decision. For example a strategy to maximize expected winnings may sometimes yield the same decision as a strategy to always shoot for the highest possible payout.

In various embodiments a gaming device may be configured to pursue a first strategy e.g. optimal strategy for some percentage of time or for some percentage of games played. During the times or the games when optimal strategy is not used some other strategy may be used. The other strategy may be a strategy which attempts to obtain the largest possible payout whether or not obtaining such a payout is a remote possibility. The other strategy may be a strategy which always seeks to obtain a payout above a certain level. For example one strategy in video poker may be to maximize the chances of receive a flush or better.

In various embodiments a gaming device is configured to play a sequence of games automatically. Playing games automatically may include making strategy decisions. However in various embodiments a gaming device may halt the automatic play of a game and wait to receive a player input to the game. The player may then provide an input. The input may indicate a strategy to pursue in a game. For example the input may indicate which cards to hold in a game of video poker or whether to hit or stand in blackjack. A gaming device may halt automatic play to allow for player input for various reasons. A gaming device may halt automatic play if a two possible decisions are equally valid according to some strategy e.g. if two possible decisions both lead to the same expected winnings for the player b a possible payout for a game is larger than a predetermined threshold e.g. if a possible payout for a game is more than 500 times the amount wagered c a large payout has more than a predetermined probability of occurring e.g. if a royal flush has more than a 1 chance of occurring d a winning payout is certain to occur e.g. if a player has received three cards of the same rank in the first five cards dealt in a game of video poker the player may be allowed to complete the game manually to experience the pleasure of winning e if the gaming device has been configured to stop for any particular outcome or intermediate outcome e.g. if the gaming device has been configured to stop automatic play when there are two aces dealt to a player in a game of blackjack then the gaming device may actually stop automatic play when two aces are dealt to a player in a game of blackjack or any other circumstances or criteria dictate that the gaming device should halt automatic play. In various embodiments automatic play may stop so that a gaming device may accept a player decision. However automatic play may resume once a player has made his decision in various embodiments. In various embodiments after automatic play has stopped a player must explicitly indicate that he wishes for automatic play to resume. For example the player may press a button that says resume automatic play . Other wise the player may continue to initiate games and make decisions manually.

In various embodiments automatic play may be halted upon any event or sequence of events. A sequence of events may include a sequence of outcomes. Automatic play may be halted if for example the player wins on five games in a row the player loses on five games in a row the player wins more than a predetermined amount of money in a some number of games e.g. if the player wins more than 50 in ten hands a particular card occurs in a predetermined number of games in a row a particular outcome occurs in a predetermined number of games in a row or upon any other sequence events or pattern of events. Further patterns are described herein and various embodiments contemplate that automatic play may be halted upon the occurrence of any particular or designated pattern or sequence of events.

In various embodiments automatic play may be paused for some period of time to allow for player input. However if the player has not provided input after some period of time the gaming device may automatically determine an input. For example the gaming device may determine an input according to optimal strategy. In various embodiments a halt or a pause in automatic play may be emphasized with a beep vibration or other alert. For example a beep may signify to the player that he must make some decision in a game and that he can not sit back and watch games proceed automatically. Similarly a vibration on a mobile gaming device may alert a player to take the mobile gaming device out of his pocket because his input is required. In various embodiments a player may set the preference as to the type of alert that will be provided to him. In various embodiments when automatic play stops the gaming device may display or otherwise communicate a message to the player. The message may say that input is requested from the player. The message may further indicate the amount of time that the player has to provide an input e.g. before automatic play is resumed . In various embodiments when a player is asked for a manual input the player may have an option to tell the gaming device to make its own decision. For example a button may read Keep playing . Pressing such a button may cause the gaming device to determine a decision. The decision may be made according to any particular strategy such as according to optimal strategy.

In various embodiments a gaming device may halt automatic play. However the gaming device may halt automatic play only to allow a player to view the state of the current game. The gaming device may after some period of time resume automatic play. In various embodiments upon a halting or pausing of automatic play a player may have the opportunity to interject and make his own decision. For example a player may press buttons which are ordinarily indicative of a player strategy. For example a player may press buttons underneath cards dealt in a game of video poker indicating the player s desire to hold the cards. By pressing such buttons the player may override the decision process of the gaming device and cause his own decisions to be registered in the game. In various embodiments a player may override the decisions of the gaming device at any point not just when the gaming device has paused. For example the player may at any point during automatic play press a button which says stop . The player may then have the opportunity to input his own decisions. The player may later press a button labeled resume or the like. Automatic play may thereupon resume.

In various embodiments a gaming device may make decisions automatically. However the gaming device may seek confirmation from the player. Upon learning of a decision e.g. because an indication of the decision is displayed on the screen of the gaming device a player may have the opportunity to press a button or provide some other input to stop the gaming device and instead to cause the gaming device to make a different decision. In various embodiments a gaming device may make automatic decisions. The gaming device may allow some period of time e.g. 3 seconds for the player to override a decision. However if there is no input from the player the gaming device may proceed to generate the remaining part of the game stemming from the decision.

In various embodiments when automatic play has been halted or paused the player may have the opportunity to specify a new strategy to be used. When automatic play is subsequently resumed the new strategy may be employed.

In various embodiments when a player elects to bet on some number of games such games may be generated and conducted for the first time for the player. In various embodiments when a player elects to bet on some number of games such games may include games that have already been played by other players e.g. by primary players . Thus for example a player may elect to bet on 100 games. A casino server may then select 100 games that have been previously played. The selection may be random. If such games were winning for the player who originally played them the current player may win as well. If such games were losing for the player who originally played them the current player may lose as well. In various embodiments a player may elect to play some number of games. A casino server may then use games that are currently being played or about to be played. For example the casino may use games that are played at video poker machines around the casino. The player may participate in such games and may win if those games result in a win for the player side and may lose if those games result in a loss for the player side. In various embodiments a player may bet against a primary player and may e.g. win when the primary player loses and lose when the primary player wins. Thus it will be appreciated that when a player selects some number of games in which to participate the games may be generated for the first time for that player or the games may be games that have been or will be played by others.

In various embodiments two or more players may wish to engage in automatic play. For example both players may wish to have 50 games played automatically by the players respective gaming devices. The players may in various embodiments participate in the same games. The common games played may for example come from other players around the casino. In various embodiments the casino may have a data feed of game results from around the casino. The data feed may go to the gaming devices of players who wish to play automatically and may thereby allow such players to participate in games from around the casino. In various embodiments when players participate in a common set of games the players may participate in such games out of order. For example player A may participate first in game X and then in game Y. Player B may participate first in game Y and then in game X.

In various embodiments a number of interfaces may be associated with automatic play. Input buttons may allow a player to override a strategy to tell a gaming device to halt automatic play to tell a gaming device to resume automatic play to indicate a particular strategy to be used to indicate the parameters using which a gaming device should initiate a session of automatic play and to perform any other function. In various embodiments a player may be required to make two button presses to override a strategy suggested by the gaming device. The two button presses may include pressing each of two different buttons or may include pressing the same button twice e.g. double clicking . In this fashion there may be a reduced chance that a player automatically overrides a good decision of the gaming device. In various embodiments a wheel such as a thumb wheel may allow a player to vary the speed of automatic play. For example the player may move the wheel one way to increase the speed of play and may move the wheel the other way to decrease the speed of play. In various embodiments a button may be used to indicate that a gaming device should proceed with automatic play such as after the gaming device has paused.

In various embodiments when automatic play has been paused to await the player s input or for any other reason the player may cause automatic play to resume in various ways. The player may double click on a button to cause automatic play to proceed. In some embodiments the player may press any button to cause automatic play to proceed. In some embodiments the player may touch any area of a touch screen to cause automatic play to proceed. In some embodiments the player may make a noise or vocalization. For example the player may clap twice in order to cause automatic play to proceed. In various embodiments a player may scroll a thumb wheel to cause automatic play to proceed.

In various embodiments when automatic play has been paused to await the player s input the player may provide an input in various ways. Certain ways may be available for the player to quickly and or conveniently provide a desired input with minimal effort. In a game of video poker a list of strategies may be provided for a player. The list of strategies may include corresponding expected winnings for each strategy and or may include one or more other statistics for each strategy. The strategies may be sorted by expected value or by some other metric. The player may then select a strategy with one input based on his desired metric. For example to execute the strategy with the highest expected winnings the player may simply click on the strategy from the list. This may save the player the trouble of executing the strategy himself by for example selecting all cards to hold in order to follow the strategy. In some embodiments a player may indicate that a random strategy should be followed. For example in bonus round a player may have the option of opening one of three envelopes. The player may press a button touch an area of the screen or otherwise provide an indication that a random strategy should be chosen on the player s behalf and carried out e.g. that a random envelope should be chosen .

In various embodiments every game played could be an entry into a drawing. The faster games are played e.g. in an automatic play mode the more entries a player may receive. Drawings may be done at certain times e.g. at 4 00 every day or at random times. Thus players may be encouraged to play games at a more rapid pace e.g. to have games played automatically at a more rapid pace so as to accumulate plenty of entries by the time any random drawing occurs. In various embodiments cards received in games may constitute entries into a drawing. A player may win if the cards he has received in a game match the cards drawn in a drawing. As will be appreciated other game indicia may serve as entries into a drawing where indicia drawn may be compared to indicia received from players entering the drawing. In various embodiments games played cards received or other indicia received may serve as entries into a drawing. In various embodiments a meter may indicate to a player how many hands he has played how many cards he has received and or how many other types of indicia he has received. The meter may thereby indicate to the player how many entries he has in an upcoming drawing. The player may be encouraged to play more rapidly so as to watch the meter go higher.

In various embodiments outcomes or indicia received by a player in a first game may serve as entries into a second game e.g. into a drawing. In various embodiments entry into the second game may be free of charge. For example the player s outcomes or indicia may be entered automatically once the player has made his bet in the first game and played the first game. In various embodiments the player may have to pay extra or otherwise provide extra consideration in order to be entered into the second game. In various embodiments the player may make a bet on a first game and then pay an additional amount equal to 10 of the bet in order to be entered into a second game. In various embodiments the price of entry into the second game may be a proportion of the bet in the first game e.g. 20 e.g. 50 or may be a fixed price e.g. 0.10 e.g. 1.00 . In various embodiments a player may stand to win in the second game an amount that is based on the bet made by the player for the second game. In various embodiments the player may stand to win in the second game an amount that is based on the bet made by the player for the first game. In various embodiments a player may make a single bet prior to starting the first game. The single bet may enter the player into both the first game and into the second game. In various embodiments the player makes a first bet on the first game. The player later e.g. after completing the first game has the option of making the second bet in order to enter his outcome from the first game into the second game. In various embodiments the player may configure his gaming device mobile gaming device personal computer or other device to automatically e.g. without the player s further input enter the player into the second game. The automatic entry may entail deducting further credits from the player. In various embodiments the player may manually confirm a desire to be entered in the second game after finishing the first game.

In various embodiments an interface such as a graphical user interface may allow a player to enter or play in a second game based on an outcome result or indicium from a first game. The player may use the interface to specify an amount to bet in the second game. For example the player may enter an absolute amount to bet e.g. 0.25 or may enter a percentage. The percentage may represent a percentage of the player s bet for the first game. The player may use the interface to specify whether he will be entered automatically into the second game following the conclusion of the first game. For example if the player checks a particular box on the interface then at the conclusion of a first game an additional number of credits will be deducted from the player s credit balance and the player will be automatically entered into the second game. In various embodiments the player may check a box that says he never wishes to be entered into a second game following the conclusion of the first game. In this case the player may proceed from game to game without ever being entered into the drawing or other procedure of the second game. In various embodiments a player may check a box or otherwise indicate that he wishes to have the option of entering the second game following the conclusion of the first game. Subsequently once the player has finished the first game the player s device e.g. gaming device e.g. betting terminal e.g. mobile gaming device e.g. kiosk may prompt the player with a question asking the player whether or not he would like to enter his outcome from the first game into the second game. The player may then press one of two buttons such as yes button or no button to indicate whether or not he would like the outcome from the first game to enter him into the second game. The prompt given to the player may indicate a number of credits that will be deducted from the player should he decide to be entered into the second game.

The interface may include a graphical display on a display screen. The display may include text boxes check boxes buttons or other areas where a player may enter information. The player may enter information using a mouse keyboard joystick track ball or any other input device. The player may enter information using a touch screen interface e.g. by touching the display which shows information that the player enters. In various embodiments the player may use voice to enter information into the interface.

In various embodiments the interface may show an indicator of whether the player will be automatically entered into the second game whether the player will not be entered into the second game or whether some other event will transpire. For example a border of the graphical user interface may be a first color if the player will be automatically entered into the second game and a second color if the player will not be automatically entered into the second game. In this way a player may be easily aware of when he will automatically be entered into the second game and when he will not be. Many other indicators are also possible. For example a flashing portion of the display screen or a flashing light on the player s gaming device may indicate when the player will or will not be automatically entered into the second game. In various embodiments a sound effect or tone may indicate when the player stands to be automatically entered into a second game and when he doesn t.

In various embodiments the player may readily enter into his GUI a preference as to whether or not to be automatically entered into a second game upon completing a first game. For example the player may check a box that causes the outcomes of his first game e.g. a slot machine game to be automatically entered into a second game e.g. a lottery type drawing . However after playing 10 games the player may decide he no longer wishes to be entered automatically into the second game following the completion of the first game. As such the player may uncheck the box. The player may indicate a desire to be entered automatically or not in many other ways. For example a button or a switch on the player s device may toggle the device between a state where the player is entered automatically into the second game and a state where he is not.

In various embodiments the player may configure his device e.g. his gaming device to automatically enter him into the second game conditional on the occurrence of some outcomes. For example if the player is playing a game of video poker the player may wish that only hands with the ranking of flush be entered into the second game. Thus if the player achieves a flush in the first game the hand may be automatically entered into the second game. However if the player does not achieve a flush in the first game then the player may receive no entry into the second game following the first game.

In various embodiments when the player has been entered into a second game a message or other text may appear on his display screen e.g. on his GUI . The message may inform the player that he has been entered into the second game.

In various embodiments when a player begins a first game bets for both the first game and for the second game may be deducted from the player s credit balance. In this way money is not later automatically deducted from the player. Rather the player consciously chooses at the outset to bet in both the first and the second game. If the player wanted to the player could bet only in the first game.

In various embodiments a jackpot such as a progressive jackpot may receive as contributions portions of bets made from automatic play. Thus automatic play may cause a jackpot to grow in size. Players who participate in automatic play may also have the opportunity to win the jackpot such as the progressive jackpot. Thus players may have additional incentive to engage in automatic play.

In various embodiments a particular area of a casino includes facilities to allow secondary players to monitor primary players at one or more games throughout the casino or at one or more games beyond the casino. The area of the casino may include one or more monitors. Such monitors may be small or large. Large monitors for example may be visible to multiple secondary players. Small monitors may be visible to individual secondary players. Further the individual players may customize the small monitors so as to view the primary player of interest a statistic of interest a game of interest or anything else of interest. The monitors may display various information. Monitors may display video feeds from games. For example a monitor may show a video feed of a blackjack game which is in progress. Monitors may recreate game outcomes. For example a monitor may show a rendition of a slot machine game that has been or is being played by a primary player. Monitors may also show statistics. For example a monitor may show the total amount of money won by a primary player in the last hour the number of times a particular dealer has busted in the past half hour the number of consecutive times red has come up at the roulette wheel and so on. In various embodiments a monitor may show betting rules odds payout ratios and other information which may apply to bets made by the secondary player. For example a monitor may indicate that a secondary player can win a payout at odds of 1 1 by for betting that a primary player will get red in roulette and that the secondary player can win a payout at odds of 16 1 for betting that a primary player will get red four times in a row at roulette.

In various embodiments an area of the casino may include facilities for betting on one or more games being monitored. For example terminals may allow secondary players to place bets on a game e.g. on a game which is being monitored. The terminal may include keys acceptors for charge cards e.g. for credit cards or debit cards acceptors for currency or gaming chips acceptors for cashless gaming tickets keys or buttons for entering betting information e.g. for entering an amount to bet e.g. for choosing a game on which to bet and any other facilities or interfaces for allowing bets. A terminal may include a monitor. The monitor may be used to display betting information to a secondary player to show the secondary player the game on which he is betting to show the secondary player how much money he has won and to show the secondary player any other information related to his bet or otherwise relevant to the player.

In various embodiments a betting area for secondary players to bet on and monitor the games of primary players may have the appearance of a sports book.

As used herein the term viewing window includes an area of a gaming device at which symbols or outcomes are visible. The area may for instance include a pane of glass or other transparent material situated over reels of the gaming device. Thus only the portion of the reels under the transparent material may be visible to the player. A viewing window may include a display screen in some embodiments. The symbols or outcomes visible in the viewing window may include the symbols or outcomes that determine the player s winnings.

As used herein the term encryption refers to a process for obscuring or hiding information so that the information is not readily understandable without special knowledge. The process of encryption may transform raw information called plaintext into encrypted information. The encrypted information may be called ciphertext and the algorithm for transforming the plaintext into ciphertext may be referred to as a cipher. A cipher may also be used for performing the reverse operation of converting the ciphertext back into plaintext. Examples of ciphers include substitution ciphers transposition ciphers and ciphers implemented using rotor machines.

In various encryption methods ciphers may require a supplementary piece of information called a key. A key may consist for example of a string of bits. A key may be used in conjunction with a cipher to encrypt plaintext. A key may also be used in conjunction with a cipher to decrypt ciphertext. In a category of ciphers called symmetric key algorithms e.g. private key cryptography the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The sanctity of the encrypted information may thus depend on the key being kept secret. Examples of symmetric key algorithms are DES and AES. In a category of ciphers called asymmetric key algorithms e.g. public key cryptography different keys are used for encryption and decryption. With an asymmetric key algorithm any member of the public may use a first key e.g. a public key to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext. However only the holder of a second key e.g. the private key will be able to decrypt the ciphertext back in to plaintext. An example of an asymmetric key algorithm is the RSA algorithm.

It will be appreciated that other methods besides encryption may be used to hide or obscure information such as encoding or steganography. Such methods may also be used in conjunction with cryptography.

Hashing is a process whereby input data typically of arbitrary length is transformed into output data typically of shorter length and or of fixed length. A hash function is a function that performs the transformation. Often useful hash functions will be one way functions. That is for a given input the output can be computed readily. However for a given output the input which produced the output will be difficult to calculate. Also useful hash functions will often have the property that two differing inputs rarely produce the same output. Hashing can be used for the following purposes 

In some embodiments the server of Casino A may receive data about a game from gaming device or from monitoring device . A monitoring device may include a device such as a camera or microphone which may monitor a game at Casino A and transmit data about the game to the server of Casino A. The server of Casino A may transmit data received from gaming device or monitoring device to the terminal of a secondary player X so as to allow the terminal to recreate the game to accept bets from secondary player X on the game and to pay winnings to secondary player X based on the game.

The server of Casino A may further transmit received data about a game to the server of Casino B . The server of Casino B may in turn transmit such data to the terminal of a secondary player Y so as to allow the terminal to recreate the game to accept bets from secondary player Y on the game and to pay winnings to secondary player Y based on the game.

The server of Casino A may further transmit received data about a game to the device of secondary player Z e.g. through the Internet. The device of secondary player Z may in turn recreate the game for secondary player Z receive bets on the game from secondary player Z and or credit winnings to secondary player Z based on the game.

The server of Casino A may further transmit received data about a game to the server of the regulator . Such data may allow the regulator to monitor the fairness of games to watch for illegal gaming to track taxable income of the casino or to perform any other desired function.

In various embodiments the terminal of secondary player X may transmit to the server of Casino A data about the activities of secondary player X at the terminal. Further the terminal of secondary player Y may transmit to the server of Casino B data about the activities of secondary player Y at the terminal. The server of Casino B may transmit such data to the server of Casino A . Further the device of secondary player Z may transmit to the server of Casino A data about the activities of secondary player Z at the device. Data received by the server of Casino A from terminals and and from device may allow the server of Casino A to tracking winnings and losses of secondary players X Y and Z to determine which data e.g. data about which games to transmit to the terminals or device to determine an amount owed to Casino A by Casino B for use of data from Casino A and so on. Further data received by the server of Casino A from terminals and and from device may be forwarded to the server of the regulator . The regulator may use such data to track the bets of secondary players to check for illegal gambling to monitor the fairness of games etc.

It should be appreciated that the system of represents a system according to some embodiments and that other servers devices terminals networks and communication links may be present in various embodiments.

The output device may include display screens microphones lights coin dispensers buzzers and any other means by which a gaming device may provide a signal to the secondary player. The communication port may be used to transmit and or to receive data.

The output device may include display screens microphones lights coin dispensers buzzers and any other means by which terminal may provide a signal to the secondary player. The communication port may be used to transmit and or to receive data.

Another area of the display screen includes an announcements area. The casino may make announcements to the secondary player. Such announcements may include promotional announcements. For example such announcements may include announcements of discounts at casino or other restaurants announcements of discounts on shows announcements about upcoming concerts or boxing matches announcements about discounts on hotel rooms and so on. Announcements may include promotions for other products such as automobiles toothpaste or plane flights to the Caribbean. Announcements may further include announcements about primary players in which the secondary player may be interested. For example an announcement may indicate that a favored primary player of the secondary player has just begun play.

Another area of the display screen includes a list of primary players that are available in the sense that the secondary player may participate in the games of these primary players. This display area may identify the primary player either by real name or by an alias such as TeeBone . The alias may allow a primary player to maintain some anonymity or privacy. This display area may further indicate a game which the primary player is playing and thus the game the secondary player would be participating in a minimum bet required of the secondary player to participate in the game and one or more statistics related to the primary players. For example statistics may indicate a number of consecutive games won by the primary players. This display area may further include areas where a secondary player can touch in order to begin participating in the games of a primary player. For example by touching an area labeled select next to primary player Robert Clements the secondary player may begin participating in the games of Robert Clemens.

Another area of the display screen includes windows where a secondary player may track the progress of games in which he is participating. depicts a first window where the secondary player can follow the game of primary player TeeBone in whose game the secondary player is participating. The game is blackjack and the secondary player has a bet of 5 riding on the game. The game is currently in progress. depicts a second window where the secondary player can follow the game of primary player Sue Baker. The game is a slot machine game. The game has just finished with an outcome of cherry bar cherry . The secondary player has just won 6 on the game. Now the secondary player has the opportunity to place bets on the next game as indicated by the status open for bets .

Another area of the display screen includes a display of the credit balance of the secondary player. These credits may be used to bet on games in which the secondary player is participating. Each credit may correspond for example to 0.25 in value. The secondary player may place bets using the betting areas of the display screen including a Bet area a Bet 1 area a Bet 5 area a Repeat Last Bet area and an Auto Bet area. When touched such areas may apply to only the game which has a status of Open for Bets . For example touching the Bet may cause a bet of 1 to be placed on the game of Sue Baker since it is that game which has the status of Open for Bets . In this way there need not be a separate set of betting buttons for every game in which the secondary player is participating. The Repeat Last Bet area may allow the secondary player to easily repeat a prior bet that may take extra effort to enter using the other betting areas. For example rather than touching the Bet 1 area 4 times to enter a 4 bet the secondary player might simply touch the Repeat Last Bet area to repeat a prior bet of 4. The Auto Bet area may allow the secondary player to continue making the same bet on each new game for example without having to always enter a bet. In some embodiments the secondary player may program in a particular betting strategy and then touch the Auto Bet area to have the strategy executed automatically by the terminal of the secondary player. The Lock Game area may allow the secondary player to prevent access to the terminal by other secondary players while he steps away for a break. The Order Drinks area may allow the secondary player to order drinks or other items and have them delivered to his terminal without ever leaving.

As will be appreciated the various areas of the touch screen that allow touch interaction may also be implemented using ordinary buttons or any other interactive technology.

It should be appreciated that the figures do not necessarily show everything that might be included in a system object machine device etc. For example although not shown in gaming device may include a coin hopper.

As used herein the term payout odds may refer to a statement of an amount a player will receive in the event of a win per amount bet. For example 3 2 payout odds means that a player will receive 3 units per 2 units bet in addition to keeping his original bet provided the player wins the bet. It will be understood that a payout ratio may be readily determined from payout odds and vice versa via mathematical operations. Therefore it will be understood that embodiments described herein using payout ratios could readily be performed with payout odds and vice versa.

For a given event an appropriate set of payout ratios may be determined. For example if a secondary player is betting on a two as the resolution of a roll of a six sided die the secondary player may stand to win five times his initial wager a payout ratio of 5 if the two is in fact rolled. Note that the player is assumed to give up his bet initially so his net profit would be 4 times his initial wager if a two occurs. A set of payout ratios may be determined based on the inherent probabilities of various possible resolutions of the event. In the above example the inherent probability of a two being rolled is 1 6. Thus a payout ratio of five seeks to provide the player with a payout commensurate with the inverse of the probability of the resolution that would be winning for the player while still allowing for a casino profit on average.

Once the event has resolved it may be determined whether the secondary player has won. For example suppose a secondary player has bet that the next card dealt in a game of poker will be the ace of spades. Once the next card has been dealt it may be determined whether the card is in fact the ace of spades and therefore whether the secondary player has won. If the secondary player has won the secondary player may be paid according to the payout odds.

In various embodiments an event on which a secondary player bets does not constitute a complete game for the primary player of the game. For example a secondary player may bet on what the next card will be in a game of video poker. However the outcome of the game of video poker is not solely based on the next card but rather is based on at least four other cards making up a complete hand of poker. Thus a primary player may place a bet and may be paid based on his bet and based on the resolutions of a first and a second event in a game. A secondary player may place a bet on the same game and may be paid based on his bet and based on only the resolution of the second event in the game.

In various embodiments the secondary player may be remote from the game. For example the primary player may participate in the game while physically present at a slot machine video poker machine table game or other game location. However the secondary player may be remote from the primary player such as 50 feet away such as in a different room such as in a different building such as in different city and so on.

In various embodiments the secondary player may bet on an event in a game after the game has been completed. For example the secondary player may bet on an event in a game completed the prior week. The events of the game may be unknown to the secondary player since the secondary player may not have been observing or participating in the game when it was originally played.

Embodiments described herein with respect to complete games or outcomes may similarly apply to events within a game. For example just as a secondary player may search for games having particular characteristics a secondary player may search for events within a game having particular characteristics or a secondary player may search for games with particular characteristics so as to bet on events within such games. A secondary player may search for particular primary players and bet on events within the games of such primary players.

In some embodiments a secondary player may seek to view historical or current games. The secondary player may desire to participate in the games. The secondary player may in some embodiments perform a search for games which satisfy a first set of criteria. For example a secondary player may search for games which were played by a particular primary player. The search may yield a plurality of games. The games may then be sorted using a second set of criteria. The plurality of games may be sorted according to a the time at which the games were played e.g. the games may be sorted from the most recently played to the one played the furthest in the past b the amounts won in the games e.g. the games may be sorted from the game with the highest payout to the game with the lowest payout c the amounts bet on the games d the rankings of hands dealt in the games e.g. games of poker may be sorted according to the poker ranking of the initial hand e.g. games of blackjack may be sorted according to the point total of the final hand e the results of the games e.g. the primary player won e.g. the dealer won f the initial number rolled on a die in each game of the games g the location in which the games were played e.g. games may be sorted according to the floor in the casino where the games were played h the name of the gaming devices on which the games were played e.g. games may be sorted such that the gaming devices on which the games were played are in alphabetical order i the name of the primary players who initially played the games j the number of secondary players who participated in each of the games and so on.

Any physical game described herein may be implemented electronically in various embodiments. For example embodiments pertaining to the play of blackjack at a physical card table may pertain as well to a game of blackjack played over an electronic network. For example a primary player may play blackjack using a video blackjack device. As another example a primary player may play blackjack over the Internet. A secondary player may bet on the outcomes of the game of the primary player and or on events within the game of the primary player.

In various embodiments a secondary player may participate in the game of a primary player but take the game in a different direction from the direction in which the primary player took the game. For example the primary player may be involved in a game which requires a decision on the part of the primary player. The primary player may make a first decision in the game. The secondary player meanwhile may be participating in the game but may prefer a different decision from the decision made by the primary player. Thus the secondary player may have the opportunity to complete the game in a different fashion than does the primary player. For example the outcome based on which the secondary player is paid may be different from the outcome based on which the primary player is paid. Note that the secondary player may participate in a game after the primary player has participated in the game. Thus the secondary player may participate in a historical game. The secondary player may nevertheless seek to take a different direction in the game than what happened in the original game.

The following is an example of some embodiments. A primary player begins play of a game of blackjack. The primary player is dealt a nine and a three as his initial hand. The dealer shows a two face up. The primary player decides to hit. The primary player is dealt a ten and therefore busts because his point total is now 22. The secondary player prior to seeing the ten which was dealt to the primary player decides he would rather stand than hit. At this point the casino server determines what would have happened had the primary player stood. The casino server may then play the dealer s hand or at least a simulated version of the dealer s hand. The casino server may reveal the dealer s down card to be a 10 providing the dealer with an initial point total of 12. The casino server may then make a hit decision on behalf of the dealer. The casino server may then deal a 10 to the dealer the same 10 that had gone to the primary player before . The dealer then busts and the secondary player wins. Thus both the primary player and the secondary player have started from the same game. However the primary player and the secondary player have taken the game in different directions by making different decisions at a juncture in the game. As a result the primary player has lost but the secondary player has won.

It should be recognized that a secondary player may make any choice in any game at any time during the game as desired in some embodiments. For example such a secondary player may make a choice in a game that may be same or different from a choice made by a primary player at a start of a game e.g. before a primary player makes a choice after a primary player makes a choice in a middle of a game e.g. after some number of actions have been taken in a game at an end of a game e.g. for a final action in a game after some amount of time has passed after some number of actions have been taken and so on

In some embodiments a player may bet when jackpot level reaches a threshold. The player may not bet if the threshold is not met even if a pattern occurs.

Embodiments described herein may apply to statistics about the future or to historical statistics. For example a secondary player may bet that in the next hour there will be two payouts won at a casino exceeding 1000. Such a bet may constitute a bet on a statistic about the future. As another example a secondary player may bet that between the hours of 3 00 pm and 6 00 pm on Oct. 12 2003 at a particular machine at a particular casino there were 200 losing outcomes generated. Such a bet may constitute a bet on a statistic about the past. Although a secondary player may make a bet about the past the bet may still be based upon a random or uncertain set of events since the secondary player may not be aware of what happened in the past which was relevant to the statistic. Embodiments described herein may apply to statistics about the present. For example a secondary player may bet that for all video poker games currently in progress there are twenty games in which the initial five card hand dealt contains three of a kind or better. Embodiments described herein may apply to statistics that encompass the past and the present to statistics that encompass the present and the future to statistics that encompass the past and the future and to statistics that encompass the past present and future. For example a secondary player may bet that at a point in time 30 minutes into the future there will have been twenty bonus rounds achieved at a bank of slot machines in the past 50 minutes i.e. in the period beginning 20 minutes before the present and stretching to 30 minutes into the future .

In various embodiments a player e.g. a primary player e.g. a secondary player may carry a mobile device. The mobile device may provide an interface via which the player may participate in a game. The mobile device may receive data from a casino server from a gaming device from a gaming table or from any other source. The data may include game data. Based on the data the mobile device may create or recreate a depiction of a game. For example the data received by the mobile device may include data indicating cards that have been dealt in a game numbers that have been rolled on dice numbers which have been determined in a roulette game and so on. Based on the data the mobile device may create or recreate a depiction of a slot machine game a video poker game a roulette game or any other game. In some embodiments the mobile device may indicate e.g. via text on a display screen the events that occurred in a game without graphically depicting the game. The mobile device may include input devices such as buttons touch pads track balls keys touch screens microphones and so on. The mobile device may accept commands and other inputs from the player via the input devices. The mobile device may receive from the player inputs indicating an amount to bet on a game a strategy to be used in a game a decision to be made in a game a bet to be made in a game and so on. The mobile device may transmit any inputs received from the player to the casino server to a gaming device e.g. to a slot machine to a gaming table to a dealer to a croupier or to any other entity that is conducting a game. The mobile device may communicate via an intermediary with an entity conducting a game. For example the mobile device may transmit data to and receive data from a casino server. The casino server may in turn transmit data to and receive data from a table game. In this way the table game and the mobile device may communicate through the casino server.

Using the mobile device the player may participate in a live game. If the player is acting as a primary player then the player may initiate the play of the game and make decisions in the game. If the player is acting as a secondary player then the player may place a bet on a game of a primary player.

In various embodiments the mobile device may be configured to select an entity conducting a game based on the location of the entity and or based on the location of the game. For example a mobile device may be configured to select a table game of blackjack that is located within 100 feet of the mobile gaming device. Accordingly the mobile device may begin receiving data from the table game and transmitting data to the table game. The mobile device may transmit to the table game an indication that the player wishes to make a bet and start a new game. A dealer at the table game may receive instructions from the mobile device. For example a wireless receiver at the table game may receive instructions from the mobile device and cause them to be displayed on a monitor at the table game. The dealer may follow the instructions. For example the dealer may deal cards at a new position at the table. The position may remain physically unoccupied. Nevertheless the cards may represent the cards of the player who is playing via the mobile device. As events occur in the table game data about such events may be transmitted to the mobile device. For example the cards dealt to the hand of the player may be read by a reader on the card shoe as they are dealt. Data indicative of the cards may be transmitted to the mobile device via a wireless transmitter at the table. The mobile device may receive the data and display game information to the player based on the received data. The player may input game decisions such as hit or stand decisions after which such decisions may be transmitted back to the game table by the mobile device. The process may continue through one game or through a whole series of games.

In various embodiments a mobile device may initiate communication with a table game gaming device or other entity that is most proximate to the mobile device. For example the mobile device may determine that a particular slot machine is the closest slot machine to the mobile device. Accordingly the mobile device may initiate communication with the slot machine. The player with the mobile device may then participate in the games of the slot machine. The player may participate as a primary player or as a secondary player in various embodiments. If the player participates as a primary player the mobile gaming device may receive an amount of a bet from the player and then transmit a signal to the gaming device thereby triggering the gaming device to generate an outcome. Thus the gaming device may be triggered to spin and generate an outcome without the physical presence of a player directly in front of the gaming device. For example the player may be located ten feet away from the gaming device yet the gaming device may initiate a game and generate an outcome in response to a signal from the mobile device.

In various embodiments the mobile device may initiate communication with a table gaming device game or other computing device that relays information to and from a game based on the proximity of the game and based on the type of game. For example the mobile device may initiate communication with the closest game that is a video poker game. For example the mobile device may initiate communication with the closest game that is a blackjack game. For example the mobile device may initiate communication with the closest game that is a craps game.

In various embodiments the mobile device may initiate communication with a game based on the presence of a primary player at the game. For example the player with the mobile device may wish to act as a secondary player in a game of blackjack. Accordingly the player may wish to find the nearest game of blackjack in which there is already a primary player participating. The player with the mobile device may then act as a secondary player and participate in the game of the existing primary player. In various embodiments if the player with the mobile device wishes to act as a primary player the mobile device may initiate communication with a game where there is a spot available for a primary player. For example a player with a mobile device may wish to participate in a game of blackjack as a primary player. The mobile device may initiate communication with a blackjack table at which at least one seat is unfilled. The player with the mobile device may play in the game of blackjack as a primary player. However in various embodiments the player with the mobile device need not actually sit down at the table. The dealer may simply deal cards to a particular spot which is understood to belong to the player with the mobile device. The player with the mobile device may make game decisions and key them into the mobile device. The mobile device may communicate the decisions to the blackjack table e.g. to a computing device with transmitting receiving antenna situated on the blackjack table . The decisions of the player may then be communicated to a dealer who may then act based on the decisions e.g. by dealing or not dealing cards.

In various embodiments a mobile device may initiate communication with a game a gaming device a device which is associated with a game etc. based on a number of factors. A mobile device may communicate with a game based on a the type of game e.g. poker e.g. blackjack e.g. slot machine b based on the amount of the bet required at the game e.g. the mobile device may initiate communication with a game only if the minimum bet required is less than 25 e.g. the mobile device may initiate communication with a game only if the minimum bet required is greater than 1 c the availability of a spot at the game d based on the presence of a particular dealer e.g. the mobile device may initiate communication with a game if dealer Joe Smith is dealing e based on historical outcomes of the game e.g. the mobile device may initiate communication with a game if the last 5 games played were winning games e.g. the mobile device may initiate communication with a game if primary players at the game have lost more than 100 in the last hour f based on the proximity of the game to the mobile device g based on the location of the game h based on the location of the mobile device and so on.

In various embodiments the mobile device may initiate communication with a game automatically once a triggering condition has been met. For example when the mobile device comes within ten feet of a blackjack game communication may be automatically initiated between the game and the mobile device. Communication may be triggered without input from the player with the gaming device. The triggering conditions may however have been previously entered or defined by the player with the mobile device.

The mobile device may have various ways of determining if the mobile device is proximate to a game. The mobile device may include a location sensor or detector. For example the mobile device may include a GPS reader. For example the mobile device may receive signals from multiple fixed beacons with known locations and triangulate its own location based on arrival times of the signals from the fixed beacons. The mobile device may store records of the locations of various games. For example the mobile device may include an internal map detailing the locations of various games. If the mobile device determines that it is at a particular location and finds that the particular location happens to be close to the location of a game e.g. as determined from the internal map then the mobile device may determine that the mobile device is proximate to the game. The mobile device may thereby initiate communication with the game.

In various embodiments a game e.g. a gaming device e.g. a table game may include a beacon or antenna that broadcasts signals within a short range. For example a game may include a radio frequency identification RFID tag. The signal broadcast by the game may be detectable within a certain radius of the game. The mobile device may include a receiver which is capable of detecting the signal broadcast from the game. If the mobile device detects the signal the mobile device may initiate communication with the game.

In various embodiments a game e.g. a gaming device e.g. a table game may initiate communication with a mobile device. In various embodiments a game may detect when the mobile device is proximate. For example the mobile device may contain an antenna that broadcasts signals within a short radius of the mobile device. For example the mobile device may include a radio frequency identification RFID tag. A game may detect the presence of the tag and may initiate communication with the mobile device.

In various embodiments the mobile device may broadcast signals. The signals may be detected at fixed detectors at known locations e.g. at known locations in a casino. The position of the mobile device may then be triangulated using methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example based on the travel time of the signal to a fixed detector a circle may be drawn around the detector indicating possible locations of the mobile device. With several detectors in place multiple circles may be drawn. The mobile device may be assumed to be located where the circles all intersect or come close to intersecting. The casino server may be in communication with the detectors. The casino server may thereby derive the location of the mobile device. The casino server may compare the location of the mobile device to known locations of a game. If the mobile device is found to be proximate to a game the casino may alert the game and or the mobile device of the proximity. The mobile device may thereupon initiate communication with the game or vice versa.

In various embodiments a player may participate at a table game via a mobile device. The player may enter bets into the mobile device. The player may have an account balance with the casino. For example the player may have 10 000 on deposit with the casino. As the player enters a bet the amount of the bet may be deducted from the player s account balance. When the player wins money in a game the amount of the win may be added to the player s account balance. In various embodiments the player may place bets through the mobile device without such bets being revealed to other players. For example the player with the mobile device may enter bets into the mobile device e.g. by keying in an amount of the bet without having to actually place chips on a gaming table. The player with the mobile device thus avoids a situation where other players can see how many chips are being bet by the player with the mobile device. The ability to place a bet without the amount of the bet being revealed to other players or to spectators may be important to a player. A player who is betting a lot of money may wish to avoid attracting attention of potential thieves for example. A player may also benefit from not having to carry large amounts of money away from a table. For example a player may win 40 000 at a table. Rather than gathering his 40 000 in chips and leaving the player may have his winning stored in his account with the casino where they cannot easily be stolen.

The ability of a mobile device to communicate with a game and to allow the player with the mobile device to participate in the game may offer additional benefits. In some embodiments a table game may be full. For example every seat at a blackjack table may be currently occupied by players. The player with the mobile device may nevertheless be able to participate in a game at the table. For example the dealer may deal an extra hand for the player with the mobile device and place such a hand in a spot with no seat in front of it e.g. in a spot close to the dealer .

In various embodiments a player may use a handheld device whether the device is used to play a primary game e.g. against the dealer or whether the device is used to play a secondary game.

In various embodiments a player participating in table game using a mobile device may send a tip to the dealer of the game using the mobile device. For example the player may use input devices e.g. keys e.g. a touch screen on the mobile device to indicate a desire to provide a tip and to indicate an amount of a tip. The amount of the tip may be deducted from an account balance that the player has with the casino. The amount of the tip may be credited to an account of the dealer. The dealer may be authorized to take an amount of chips equal to the tip from the table and put such chips in his pocket for example. Using a mobile device a player may indicate a an amount of a tip to provide b a message to be associated with the tip e.g. Hi this tip is from Joe e.g. Hi thanks for the cards last hand c a dealer to which to provide the tip e.g. the player may be simultaneously participating in games at two or more tables and may need to specify a dealer d whether or not the tip will be provided anonymously and so on. In various embodiments when a tip is sent to a dealer the dealer is informed of the originator of the tip. In this way the player sending the tip can receive his due appreciation from the dealer. A screen at a game table may provide a message indicating who provided the tip. For example the screen may display a message for the dealer saying John Brown just gave you a 5 tip. In some embodiments the dealer may view a picture of the player providing the tip. In this way the dealer may be able to see visually who among the players standing near the table provided the tip. In various embodiments a dealer may receive a message saying that a tip came from a mobile device player in the area. For example the message might say a mobile device player in the area has just given you a tip of 1 .

In various embodiments a player may participate in a game via a remote device or terminal. A player may participate via a fixed terminal containing a display screen processor memory and communication device for example. A player may also participate via a mobile device. In various embodiments a remote terminal can play a game on behalf of the player. In various embodiments a remote device may make game decisions on behalf of the player. Such game decisions may include decisions of whether to hit or stand in blackjack and decisions on which cards to draw in a game of video poker. In various embodiments a remote device may make decisions as to how much to bet. Decisions about amounts to bet may include decisions about how much to bet at the start of a game decisions about whether or not to add to a bet e.g. decisions about whether to double down in a game of blackjack and decisions about how much to bet during the course of a game e.g. during the course of a game of poker .

The player at the remote terminal may authorize the remote device to make decision in a game on his behalf. The player may for example type in his initials to indicate that he is authorizing the terminal to make game decisions on his behalf. The player may specify constraints or parameters for the decisions. For example the player may specify an amount of a bet to be made on any given game a maximum amount of a bet to be made on any given game a total number of games to be played and so on. In some embodiments a player may authorize the remote device to make bets on games until the player has won or lost a certain amount. For example the player may authorize the device to continue betting on behalf of the player until the player has either doubled his current bankroll e.g. an amount the player has on deposit with the casino or until the player has lost half of his bankroll. In various embodiments the player may specify a strategy to be used in a game. For example the player may specify what action should be taken in a game of blackjack should the player have 10 points and should the dealer have a three face up. In some embodiments the player may select from two or more pre defined strategies. For example a player may tell indicate that he wishes to use a predefined risky strategy or a predefined conservative strategy. In some embodiments the player may authorize the terminal to play according to an optimal strategy and or to play according to a strategy that maximizes a parameter such as an expected amount to be won from a game.

A player at a remote terminal may specify various rules for betting. Rules for betting may include one or more of the following a the terminal is to bet a fixed amount on every game e.g. 2 on every game b the terminal is to bet an amount on a given game which depends on the result e.g. win lose of the prior game c the terminal is to bet an amount which doubles after every loss but which is 1 after every win d the terminal is to bet until X amount in total is won e the terminal is to bet until X amount in total is lost f the terminal is always to bet the maximum possible amount g the terminal is to bet X pay lines e.g. in a slot machine game and so on. Rules for betting may further include a number of games to play at once e.g. 3 games are to be played at once an amount of time to wait between playing games and so on. If the player at the remote terminal is a secondary player rules for the terminal to follow may include rules detailing the way primary players will be selected. Rules for selecting primary players may include rules for selecting primary players based on demographic information rules for selecting primary players based on the games being played by the primary players rules for selecting primary players based on historical outcomes of the players rules for selecting primary players based on amounts being wagered by the primary players rules for selecting primary players based on a strategy being used by the primary players and so on.

In various embodiments a mobile device may allow a player to participate in a nearby game e.g. as a secondary player or to play in a nearby game as a primary player. A mobile device may also allow a player to view statistics about a nearby game such as who is playing how many hands have been won by players at the table in the last hour how many hands have been won by dealers in the last hour how much money in tips the dealer has received in the last 15 minutes what the combined gross winnings are for the table over the last hour and so on.

A mobile device may indicate to a player which games are nearby and or which games are available for the player to play in or participate in. The mobile device may provide a list of available games for the player to play or participate in. For example the mobile device may display the following text 25 Blackjack game with four primary players 10 blackjack game with 6 primary players 5 roulette table with 5 primary players 1 Monopoly Slot Machine 0.25 Video Poker Machine . . . Thus the player holding the mobile device may be able to choose one of the list tables or gaming devices so that he may participate in the games at such tables or gaming devices. Once the secondary player has chosen a game or table he may also be able to choose a particular primary player in whose games to participate. For example after the player has chosen a table the mobile device may provide a list of the names of primary players at that table along with one or more data points or statistics about the primary players e.g. net winnings in the last hour e.g. age . The player with the mobile device may then get a chance to choose a primary player in whose game to participate. In various embodiments a player with a mobile device may also view a list of games where he can play as a primary player. For example a list may read 10 Craps Table one spot open 5 Blackjack Table 3 spots open . . . In various embodiments if there are games or tables nearby but no available spots the player with the mobile device may have the opportunity to join a waiting list to either player in a game or participate in a game. A player may then have the opportunity to periodically view his place on the waiting list e.g. by clicking on a view waiting list button on his mobile device.

A list of nearby games or tables may be presented in various formats to a player holding a mobile device. Some formats of the list may include text such as text descriptions of the various games. Some formats of the list may include visual representations of a game of a primary player at the game of a dealer or of any other aspect of a game. For example a mobile device may present to a player holding a mobile device a list consisting of a set of pictures of dealers. The dealers shown in the pictures may be the very dealers who are currently working at nearby games available for the player s participation. A mobile device may present a list of games by presenting a pictures of dealers b pictures of primary players at the games c pictures of the games themselves e.g. pictures of gaming tables taken from overhead e.g. pictures of gaming devices d pictures of games in progress e.g. pictures of hands laid out after each primary player has received cards in a game of blackjack e avatars or other simulated depictions of dealers or primary players f simulate depictions of games g pictures of game indicia h simulated representations of game indicia or any other visual representation of a game or any other visual representation of an aspect of a game or any other visual representation. In various embodiments a list of nearby games may include video feeds from the games. For example a list may include a series of small windows or icons. Inside the windows may be playing video feed from the action at the games represented. For example a first window may contain a miniature video feed from a first blackjack table which is near to the mobile device. A second window may contain a second miniature video feed from a second blackjack table which is near to the mobile device. A third window may contain a third miniature video feed from a slot machine that is near to the mobile device. Windows may also include simulated renditions of games. A player holding a mobile device may have the opportunity to click on any of the windows and to join or participate in the game shown in the window.

In various embodiments when a player with a mobile device participates in a game at a nearby table or game the player may get a video feed showing the action at the table. The video feed may come from a camera which is over the table and looking down upon the table for example. The player may also watch on his mobile device a simulated reenactment of the action that transpires at the table. A player holding a mobile device may also watch on the device a video feed of a gaming device e.g. a slot machine in whose games he is participating. A player holding a mobile device may also play as a primary player in a game at a table such as in a game of a nearby table. The player may similarly view video feeds of the action at the table and or may view simulated renditions of the action at the table. A player holding a mobile device may in various embodiments see text description of the action in games in which he is playing or participating. For example the mobile device may display Your primary player just got a Jack of Spades and 5 of hearts for a starting hand of 15. . . 

In various embodiments a player holding a mobile device may link to a nearby table or gaming device. The player may play games which are based on the games of the nearby table or gaming device. However the player s games may not necessarily be based on the final outcomes which occur at the nearby table or gaming device. Rather the player s games may utilize intermediate outcomes or other random or non random occurrences from the games at the table or gaming device. For example the numbers rolled on a pair of dice at a nearby craps table may be used as a random number to select a roulette outcome for the player with the mobile device. As another example a random number generated at a nearby slot machine may be used to generate a different outcome on the mobile device from the outcome ultimately generated at the slot machine. Thus a player may utilize some information from nearby games but may ultimately play a unique game himself. Random Generators

In various embodiments a card shoe may automatically deal cards. In various embodiments a card show may automatically deal cards that are face up so that the cards are visible to a camera that is located above the cards. In various embodiments cards may be placed into a card shoe face up. In this way the cards may be automatically dealt face up. In various embodiments a card shoe may show cards without expelling the cards from the shoe. The card shoe may for example maintain two internal stacks of cards. Cards may be transferred from the first stack to the second stack each card shown through a viewing window of the shoe as it is transferred. Once the first stack is depleted the second stack may be shuffled and put in the place of the first stack. The card from the newly shuffled first stack may then be transferred once again to the place of the second stack. In this way cards may be repeatedly shuffled and dealt without the necessity of a human gathering up expelled cards and placing them back into the shoe. As will be appreciated many other card shoes may be used. Any card shoe capable of automatically dealing cards may be used for example. Further a card shoe may be used in conjunction with any device which can make cards visible to a camera e.g. by flipping cards over once dealt. A card shoe may be used in conjunction with a card reader. Cards may contain special markings such as bar codes or other patterns which are machine readable and which serve to identify the rank and suit of the cards. Cards may contain RFID tags which offers signals that identify the rank and suit of the cards.

In various embodiments a card shoe may deal or reveal cards with variable speed. For example a card shoe may be capable of dealing cards at a rate between 5 cards per second and 1 card every 3 seconds. The card shoe may include controls which allow a human and or a computer to increase or to decrease the rate at which cards are dealt. In various embodiments a card shoe may be slowed down if the card shoe is generating cards for a game with a relatively slow pace. For example a card shoe may be slowed down when a game using the cards is a high stakes baccarat game. A card shoe may be sped up when a game using the cards is a game of blackjack with many experienced players.

In various embodiments the cards dealt by a card shoe may serve as a basis for the play of one or more games. For example a remote player may be involved in a game of video poker. The cards used in the game of video poker may first be dealt from the cards shoes. The rank and suit of the cards dealt may be captured e.g. by an overhead camera. Depictions of the cards may then be recreated at a remote terminal of the player.

In various embodiments a card shoe may be under manual control. For example a human or computer may indicate to the card shoe when to deal a new card. In this way a new card may be dealt only when necessary in a game. For example if a player is using the cards dealt from a card shoe for a game of video poker then the remote terminal of the player may instruct the card shoe to deal new cards only when the player has indicated which cards to discard from an initial hand. The cards dealt from the shoe may then be used as replacement cards for the cards discarded. Further the shoe may be instructed only to deal as many cards as are needed to replace the cards being discarded by the player.

In various embodiments a card shoe may deal cards at a constant rate. In various embodiments a card shoe may deal cards according to a set schedule. The card shoe may for example deal one card every second. Any player and or any game may be welcome to access the cards dealt from the card shoe. For example a player at a remote terminal may require 10 cards for a game of blackjack. The terminal may then retrieve data about the next 10 cards dealt from a card shoe. The data about the cards may then be used to recreate images of the cards to deal representations of cards and to determine whether the player won in the game of blackjack or not.

In various embodiments data about cards dealt from a card shoe may be stored. The data may be stored at a casino server at a remote terminal conducting games for players or at any other location. When data about cards are needed for a game the data may be retrieved. Data may be retrieved about cards that had been dealt in the past such as 10 minutes prior to a game being conducted such as 1 day prior to a game being conducted or such as a year prior to a game being conducted.

Cards dealt from a card shoe may be read in various ways. Image processing algorithms may recognize the characteristic card patterns or images. For example an image processing algorithm may be used to count the number of pips on a card and or to determine the suit of the card from the shape of the pips. For example optical character recognition technology may be used to discern the rank of a card based on a letter or numeral printed on the card. In various embodiments a card may include a bar code or other pattern. A laser may be used to read the bar code. A card may contain an RFID chip or other signaling device for communicating the identity of the card.

In various embodiments a live human dealer may deal cards. The dealer may deal cards for a live game at a casino. In various embodiments a dealer may simply deal cards. There may be no live players e.g. primary players near the dealer. However the cards dealt by the dealer may be used as the basis for other games such as for remote games. Accordingly in some embodiments a human dealer may deal cards face up. The cards may be read by a camera or other device. In some embodiments the dealer may key in the identities of the cards. The cards may then be used in the games of remote players.

In some embodiments multiple card shoes live human dealers or other card dealing entities may deal cards. In some embodiments a first remote game may use cards from a first card shoe and a second remote game may use cards form a second card shoe. In some embodiments a first remote game may use cards from two or more card shoes. For example a remote game may use three cards dealt from a first shoe and two cards dealt from a second shoe in order to create an initial hand of poker. It will be appreciate that the use of cards from multiple shoes may result in the possibility of different outcomes. For example if cards are used from a single shoe containing only one deck in a game of poker hands with five of a kind may not be possible. However if cards are used from two different shoes then a five of a kind hand may be possible even if both shoes are only dealing a single deck of cards.

In some embodiments a game and or a player may use cards in alternating fashion from two shoes. For example a game may use the first third and fifth cards dealt from a first shoe and a second and fourth cards dealt from a second shoe. In various embodiments a single game may use cards from any number of shoes such as from five different shoes. In various embodiments the same card may be used in two different games. For example a card dealt from a shoe may be used in a remote game of blackjack and in a remote game of video poker. In various embodiments a card dealt from a shoe may be used in a first game of blackjack and in a second game of blackjack. In various embodiments historical data about cards dealt from a shoe or about cards dealt by a human dealer may be recorded. The historical data may be made available for viewing for searching for analysis or for any other use by a player. A player may select a shoe to use for a game. For example a player may view data about the last 100 cards dealt at each of two shoes. The player may decide that the second shoe is the luckier shoe because it has dealt cards that have lead more often to player wins in a game of blackjack.

In various embodiments a card shoe may deal to a certain penetration and no more. For example a card shoe may contain 312 cards. However following a shuffle the card shoe may deal less than the full 312 cards in the shoe. This may prevent a player from counting cards. For example a card shoe with 312 cards may only deal 100 of the cards before reshuffling. In some embodiments a card shoe may continuously shuffle cards. For example following the deal of a set of cards each card may be randomly inserted into the remainder of the deck. For example following each deal the entire deck of cards may be reshuffled.

In various embodiments a card shoe or other card dealing device may have an associated applications programming interface API . The API may include various commands that may be given by remote terminals to the shuffler. There may be commands for dealing a new card for shuffling for increasing the dealing speed and for decreasing the dealing speed among other commands. In various embodiments an API may define the way in which a card shoe will communicate to a remote terminal which cards have been dealt. For example the API may allow a remote terminal to understand a particular sequence of data as the ace of spades.

In various embodiments one or more APIs may define the communication between a card shoe and a casino server. The casino server may in turn relay information about cards dealt to a terminal which is conducting a game for a player. In various embodiments one or more APIs may define the communication between a server and a terminal. The APIs may define commands by which the terminal can request a card from the server can request an increase in dealing speed can request a decrease in dealing speed or can make any other command or request.

Various games employ the use of dice. Examples include craps and Sic Bo. In various embodiments machines may be used to roll dice automatically. A reader may determine the results of the dice rolls. For example an image may capture the rolls of the dice and may determine what number has been rolled on each die. Data about what number has been rolled on a die or dice may be transmitted to a remote terminal. The remote terminal may conduct a game using data from the dice. For example the remote terminal may use data about what numbers were rolled on three dice in order to determine the results of a game of Sic Bo played by a remote player.

In various embodiments a basket may include one or more dice. The basket could be a cylinder a tube a parallelepiped or any other enclosure including any enclosure with two flat opposing surfaces. The basket may be transparent in one or more of its surfaces. In various embodiments the entire basket may be transparent. In various embodiments the basket may include two normal resting positions. In a first resting position one of two flat opposing surfaces is parallel to the ground and is the closest surface to the ground. In a second resting position the other of the two flat opposing surfaces is parallel to the ground and is the closest surface to the ground. As will be appreciated in each of these two resting positions the dice within the basket will most likely come to rest on the lower of the two flat opposing surfaces i.e. the surface closest to the ground . When the basket has come to one of the normal resting positions the dice within the basket may be read by a reader. Once the dice have been read the basket may be flipped 180 degrees so that the surface that was closest to the ground is now closest to the sky and the surface that was closest to the sky is now closest to the ground. The flipping of the basket should then cause the dice to fall to the surface that is now closest to the ground. The dice will presumably fall in a chaotic or unpredictable way so that when they land on the new bottom surface a new set of random numbers will have been generated. In various embodiments the basket may be controlled by a stepper motor. The stepper motor may accurately control the flipping of the basket so that at rest the opposing flat surfaces can be parallel to the ground. It will be appreciated that in various embodiments other basket shapes may be used. For example the basket may include a single surface which is always held substantially parallel to the ground. To randomize the dice the basket may be shaken. In various embodiments the dice contained in the basket may include RFID tags. Each face of the die may include its own RFID tag for example a detector located above the basket may detect which RFID tag is the closest of the six on a given die and may thereupon determine which number has been rolled on the die for example.

In various embodiments a random event may be used to supply data for use in one or more games. For example as described herein the shuffling and dealing of cards may determine a number of random events. The results of the random events may include which cards end up being dealt. In various embodiments the random events may generate results from a limited set of enumerated outcomes. For example the result of the roll of a die is an outcome from the set of integers 1 2 3 4 5 and 6. For example the result of the dealing of a card from a standard set of 52 cards is a card that with one of only 52 unique identities. In various embodiments data describing one of a first set of enumerated outcomes may be transformed into data describing one of a second set of enumerated outcomes. In various embodiments several outcomes from a first set may be combined to create one outcome from a second set of possible enumerated outcomes. In various embodiments one outcome from a first set of enumerated outcomes may be decomposed into several outcomes from a second set of enumerated outcomes. For example a first random event may be the dealing of a card. A card may be used to generate the outcomes of two dice. For example the two of clubs may correspond to a roll of two dice where each die shows the number 1 on its top face.

In another example three dice are rolled. The three dice are used to define the rank and suit of a card. For example a first die is rolled. If the first die shows a one then the card is a club. If the first die shows a two then the card is a heart. If the first die shows a three then the card is a diamond. If the first die shows a four then the card is a spade. If the first die shows a five or a six then the die is rolled again until it shows a 1 through 4. The second die is then rolled. If the second die shows a one two or three then the third die is rolled. If the second die shows a four five or six then the second die is rolled again. The second die is continually rolled until the second die shows a 1 through 3. If the second die shows a three and the third die shows a 2 through 6 then the second and third die are rolled again. In other words the second die will have to be rolled again until it shows a 1 through 3. The third die will also be rolled again under the same circumstances as it had been originally. If however the second die shows a three and the third die shows a 1 then the rolling stops. In the end if the second die shows a 1 then the card rank will be ace if the third die shows a 1 2 if the third die shows a 2 3 if the third die shows a 3 four if the third die shows a 4 five if the third die shows a 5 and six if the third dies shows a six. If second die shows a 2 then the card rank will be 7 if the third die shows a 1 8 if the third die shows a 2 9 if the third die shows a 3 10 if the third die shows a 4 jack if the third die shows a 5 and queen if the third die shows a six. If the second die shows a 3 and the third die shows a 1 then the rank of the card will be king. No other dice combinations are possible since the dice would have been re rolled if such combinations occurred.

It will be appreciated that there may be many other algorithms for transforming data describing one set of enumerated outcomes into data describing another set of enumerated outcomes. Any other such system may be used. Thus in various embodiments cards dealt from a shoe may be used to conduct a game of craps. Dice rolled in a basket may be used to conduct a game of video poker. Coin flips may be used to conduct a game of Sic Bo or casino war. In general any set of outcomes may be used either individually or in combination to generate data describing any other set of outcomes.

In some embodiments a player may select a source and or algorithm for determining an outcome of a game. For example a player may choose a particular random number generator from a set of possible random number generators to be used in a particular game. A player may select a source of information that may be used as input to an algorithm an algorithm to be used choose between a physical action producing a result and a electronic generation of a virtual result and so on

In various embodiments a player may be engaged in a game that relies upon data from random events. The random events may occur at a location separate from the location of the player. For example the player may play a game on his mobile gaming device in New Jersey where such game relies upon random events that occurred in Nevada. The random events may also occur at a different time from the time when the player is playing. For example a player may play a game of video poker. The cards the player receives may be based on cards dealt three weeks ago from a card shoe in a casino warehouse. The random events may also occur in a different type of game than that being played by the player. For example the random events may occur in a game of craps while the player is playing a game of blackjack.

In various embodiments a player may wish to verify the authenticity of random events which determine the outcomes and payouts of the player s game. For example if the player repeatedly loses games the player may come to suspect that the outcomes of his games where not generated fairly. The player may therefore wish to receive some assurance that the outcomes were in fact generated fairly.

In various embodiments a player may request to see verification of an outcome payout and or result of a random event. The player may use one or more input keys buttons or devices to request authentication. For example an area on the touch screen of a player s mobile gaming device may include a button. The button may be labeled authenticate verify game outcome check outcome view source of outcome or other labels. The player may touch the button in order to view or otherwise receive information about the outcome payout and or result of his game.

In some embodiments video may be generated depicting the manner by which random events generated the results used in the player s game. For example when random events are used to generate results the events may be filmed. For example the rolling of dice may be filmed. As another example the dealing of cards may be filmed. The film may be stored e.g. as a digital file in a database of the casino. The film may be indexed or otherwise labeled in such a way that it is associated with a particular result or event. For example the file name of a video file may be Event 93048200 of Dec. 13 2010 .

In various embodiments a player may request to see video depicting the random events which generated the results used in the player s game. The player may then be shown the video. The video may show cards being dealt dice being rolled roulette wheels being spun or whatever was the source of the results that led to the outcome of the player s game. The video may be transmitted from the casino server to the player s mobile gaming device for example. The mobile gaming device may show the video to the player on its display screen.

In various embodiments a random number or description of a random event may be signed by an authority. The signature may take the form of a digital signature. The digital signature may serve as an endorsement or verification by the inspecting authority that the random number or data was randomly generated according to some predefined or pre established parameters. For example the digital signature may serve as verification that the random number or random data was in fact randomly generated according to some probability distribution or using some fair physical device e.g. a fairly balanced die . In various embodiments a digital signature may be affixed to group or sequence of data. For example in some embodiments a digital signature may be affixed to a sequence of 1000 random numbers representing rolls of two dice. The digital signature may serve as verification or endorsement that the numbers are fair.

In various embodiments the authority may be a gaming regulator another governmental entity a commission elected by gaming companies a non profit organization an audit firm a programming expert a cryptography expert or any other authority. The authority may verify the fairness of numbers or random data in a variety of ways. The authority may perform statistical tests to verify that the numbers or data conform to an anticipated statistical distribution. The authority may borrow the computer processor used to generate the data or numbers in the first place. The authority may physically inspect the processor or may use the processor to perform separate tests. The authority may inspect physical devices such as dice cards and roulette wheels in order to make sure such devices are fair e.g. are equally weighted or balanced . An authority may inspect a card deck for example to ensure that the deck contains all the cards it should. In some embodiments an authority may include a computer program or algorithm. For example a program may automatically perform tests on groups of random numbers to verify that such numbers follow an anticipated statistical distribution. If the numbers do follow the distribution then the program may apply a digital signature to the numbers.

In various embodiments random numbers or random data may be time stamped. Applying a time stamp to a set of data may include cryptographically encoding an indication of a time together with the data. Thus through a process of decoding the combined time and random data it may be verifiable that the data was generated at a particular time.

In various embodiments information contained in a time stamp may be used as an input into a game. For example a time indicated by the time stamp e.g. the time at which the corresponding data was generated may serve as the input for a game. The time may be used as a seed for a random number generator. Digits or numerals in the time may be used as outcomes in and of themselves. For example the tens digit for the minutes and the tens digits for the seconds reading may be used to represent rolls of dice. This may be convenient because such digits may range from 0 to 5 which can be mapped to the numbers 1 though 6 on a typical die. As will be appreciated a time reading may be used in various other fashions to provide game inputs.

In various embodiments a date may be stamped onto one or more random outcomes or onto random data. A date may be incorporated into a time stamp for example.

In various embodiments the identity of a player e.g. of a primary player who achieved a particular outcome who was present while certain data was generated or who was otherwise connected to the generation of data may be tied to the data. For example a set of random data that was generated in the games of a particular primary player may be tied or linked to the identity of the particular primary player. The linking process may involve hashing algorithms cryptographic algorithms algorithms for digital signatures or other algorithms or processes. For example identifying data for the primary player e.g. a name written in ordinary letters e.g. a player tracking card number may be combined with the randomly generated data. The combined data may be used as input to a hashing algorithm in order to generate a condensed output data string. Meanwhile plaintext version of the combined identifying data and random data may be maintained. By reapplying the hashing algorithm to the plaintext version it should be possible to verify that the same hash key is generated. Thus if the plaintext version of the combined identifying data and the randomly generated data are kept together with the hash key it may be mathematically verifiable that the particular primary player was the one who was linked to that random data. As will be appreciated many other algorithms may be used to associate a player with randomly generated data or with other data including gaming related data.

Various methods may be used to verify one or more of the following a a particular outcome or other data was generated fairly b a particular outcome or other data was generated in a particular game c a particular outcome or other data was generated at a particular time d a particular outcome or other data was generated by a particular person.

In various embodiments video footage may be captured of the outcome generation. The video footage may include footage of a gaming table footage of a slot machine footage of a gaming device footage of a mobile gaming device footage of a betting terminal or any other footage. In some embodiments video footage may be captured of a screen of computer such as where the computer is being used to generate outcomes and outputs of the generating program are sent to the computer screen.

In various embodiments video footage may capture salient information related to the time place people or other circumstances involved with generating an outcome. A gaming table may have a unique identifier or distinctive pattern featured at the table. Video footage of the gaming table may capture the unique identifier. Thus any outcomes shown in the video can be tied to that gaming table. Similarly in various embodiments a slot machine or other gaming device or other device may include a unique identifier or another distinctive feature. The identifier or distinctive feature may appear in video footage of the gaming device. Thus outcomes in the video may be tied to the gaming device.

In various embodiments video footage may capture a person involved in generating an outcome. The person may be a dealer croupier other casino employee or other person. The person may wear a name tag a badge or other means of identification. The person s face may be visible in the video. Using any of these or other identifying features a person in a video may be tied to the generation of an outcome.

In various embodiments a distinctive feature of a place may be captured in a video. For example a casino may have a unique painting window design sculpture tile pattern architectural feature or other unique or distinctive feature. Such features may be captured by a video when footage of outcomes is captured. The presence of distinctive features in the video may allow the outcome appearing in the video to be tied to a particular place.

In various embodiments video footage may include a time indicator. Thus video footage may include footage of a clock footage of a window or the outside where for example time may be approximated from the lighting footage of an area with foot traffic that varies by time of day e.g. footage of an eating area or any other video footage that may provide an indication of time. From such video footage an outcome or other data may be tied to a time.

In various embodiments a seed used to generate an outcome random number or other data may be stored. The outcome may be generated from the seed according to an outcome generating algorithm. The seed may be stored in conjunction with the outcome. Thus at a later time it may be possible to apply the same outcome generating algorithm to the seed in order to yield the same outcome.

In various embodiments a time stamp may be applied to an outcome or to other random data or to other data. In creating a time stamp a text description of the outcome or data may be combined with a text description of a time e.g. the time during which the outcome was generated. The combined text may be encrypted with a private key of trusted authority e.g. of the casino which as generated the outcome or random data . The encrypted bundle of time and outcome may then be decrypted with the public key of the trusted authority. This may allow verification that outcome is authentic and was generated at the indicated time.

In various embodiments information about a person who has generated an outcome may be cryptographically tied with an outcome or other random data or other data. In various embodiments the name of a player e.g. a primary player who played a game in which an outcome was generated may be tied to an outcome. A text description of the outcome may be combined with the player s name written in text. The two may be encrypted together using a private key of a trusted authority e.g. of a casino . By later decrypting the combined bundle of outcome and name using the trusted authority s public key it may be verified that the outcome and name are in fact tied together.

In a similar fashion information about an outcome random data or other data may be bundled with information about a place a game or any other pertinent information. The bundle may be encrypted using a private key. Other digital signature protocols may also be used.

In various embodiments a player may wish to check the circumstances under which an outcome was generated. A player may first request to see details such as the time or place where the outcome was generated. A gaming device mobile gaming device or other device may have these details stored in conjunction with the outcome and so may present the details to the player. However the player may wish for further verification. Thus the gaming device or other device may recall a digitally signed version of the outcome coupled with other details. The gaming device may show the player a representation of the digitally signed details such as a string of bits. Of course the string of bits may be unintelligible to the player. However the gaming device may then graphically represent a process of decryption e.g. where a public key of a trusted authority is being used to convert the string of bits into a plaintext description of the outcome and other details pertaining to the outcome. The representation of the process may take the form of a graphic or animation such as an animation of a person unlocking a safe. When the safe is unlocked the person removes a document which shows e.g. a description or illustration of the outcome together with a description of a time place or other details surrounding the generation of the outcome.

In various embodiments a player may summon a casino representative. The player may ask the casino representative to verify the circumstances of an outcome s generation. The casino representative may insert a card USB drive or other object into the player s gaming device. The object inserted may store a public key or other key which may be used to reveal the plaintext of a digitally signed document. In this way a digitally signed document containing details surrounding an outcome s generation may be revealed to the player.

In various embodiments video footage of an outcome may be made as the outcome is generated. For example video footage may be taken of a table game as cards or dealt as dice are rolled or as a roulette wheel is spun and comes to rest. Video footage may also be taken of gaming devices as they generate outcomes. Video may be captured by security cameras by cameras dedicated to filming games or by other cameras or image capturing devices. In various embodiments an animation or cartoon may be stored which illustrates the generation of an outcome though the animation may not be actual video footage. Rather the animation may be an illustrative representation of the generation of an outcome.

In various embodiments video footage may be provided with various tags. Tags may include or may represent information about the video footage and or about the contents of the video footage. A tag may indicate one or more of a a time the footage was taken b a place the footage was taken c an outcome that appears in the footage d an amount won in a game that appears in the footage e a first set of cards shown in the footage f a second set of cards shown in the footage g an amount of a bet that was made for the game depicted in the footage h a length of the video footage i a speed of the video footage e.g. true action e.g. slow motion j an identity of a person in the footage k a role of a person in the footage e.g. player e.g. dealer e.g. spectator e.g. attendant l an identifier of a gaming device shown in the footage m a description of the game shown in the footage e.g. jacks or better video poker e.g. Pyramid Craze Slot Machines n a strategy used in the game shown in the footage or any other information related to the footage.

Tags may be used to index and or to search the video footage. Tags may also be used to tie video footage to a particular outcome. For example a secondary player may receive a particular outcome that had previously been generated in the game of the primary player. If the secondary player wishes to view video footage of the generation of the outcome the video footage may be retrieved because a tag in the video footage indicates that the video footage is of the pertinent outcome.

Video footage may be searched based on a number of search criteria. A player or other party may wish to watch video footage of all outcomes generated at a particular gaming device during a particular one hour period. A player or other party may wish to watch video footage of all jackpot outcomes that were generated across a casino within the past day. A player may wish to watch video footage of all the outcomes generated by a particular primary player. Such requests or desires may be satisfied based on a tag search of video footage for example.

The process of tagging videos may occur in various ways. In some embodiments a person such as a casino employee may manually watch videos and record information from the videos e.g. outcomes that occurred . In various embodiments a device that was involved in generating a particular outcome may record information about the outcome information about the player using the gaming device e.g. using information obtained from a player tracking card time and date information and any other information. The gaming device may transmit such information to a casino server. The casino server may receive video footage that was taken of the gaming device. The casino server may recognize that the video footage and the information received from the gaming device represent the same event e.g. because the footage was taken at the time that the event was noted to occur e.g. because the camera which took the footage is known to point at the gaming device . The casino server may then associate the video footage with the information.

In various embodiments players may play or participate in games that utilize or are based on random number generators. The random number generators may use a physical or mechanical process such as the rolling of dice spinning of a wheel the shuffling of cards or the spinning of reels for example. The random number generators may use an electronic process such as a computer algorithm for random number generation. Random numbers may be generated in the context of an actual game e.g. where a primary player has real money at risk or in an isolated environment for example.

A player who plays at a betting terminal a mobile gaming device or at another device may utilize random numbers or random outcomes that have not been generated at his own device. For example a player with a mobile gaming device may utilize random numbers that have been generated at a stationary gaming device.

In various embodiments a player may utilize e.g. in his games random numbers from more then one origin. For example a player at a mobile gaming device may play a first game that generates an outcome based on a random number received from a first stationary gaming device. The player may then play a second game that generates an outcome based on a random number received from a second different stationary gaming device. In similar fashion the player may play a number of different games. For each game a random number may be received from a different source e.g. from a different random number generator . In various embodiments sources may be reused. For example a player s mobile gaming device may obtain random numbers from any one of ten different random number generators. However after playing a large number of games the player may have received multiple random numbers from each source.

In various embodiments a random number generator may be unavailable to provide a player with random numbers. For example a gaming device may be in use by a first player and certain regulations or procedures may preclude use of the same gaming device to provide random numbers to a second player. Thus in various embodiments a casino server or other entity may determine when one or more random number generators that are available to provide random numbers to a given player. The casino server may then direct one or more of such random number generators to provide the player e.g. the player s mobile gaming device with one or more random numbers. The casino server may itself relay the random numbers to the player. The casino server may determine an available random number generator based on one or more of the following criteria a the random number generator is not currently generating random numbers for a player b the random number generator is powered on e.g. the random number generator is part of a stationary gaming device c the random number generator has an attendant e.g. a casino employee is present to roll dice to generate random dice rolls and or any other criteria.

In various embodiments a casino server or other entity may select a random number generator based on the type of random numbers that are required for a player s purposes and based on the types of random numbers that can be provided by the random number generator. For example if the player wishes to play a game of craps a generator may generate numbers corresponding to the role of two dice.

In various embodiments the use by a player of more than one random number generator reduces the chances that a player or that a casino will be harmed by a faulty e.g. biased random number generator.

In various embodiments the same random number generator may be used to supply random numbers for multiple different games. The games may be of different types. For example one of the games may be craps. Another of the games may be video poker. In various embodiments the same random number may be supplied to two players playing different types of games. Where the same random number is used for different games the risk that a faulty random number generator will simultaneously work to the disadvantage of all players is reduced. Similarly where the same random number is used for different games the risk that a faulty random number generator will simultaneously work to the advantage of all players and thus to the disadvantage of the casino is reduced.

In various embodiments a machine device or other entity that generates random outcomes may be under the control of a player. The control may be either direct or indirect. For example a player may have the opportunity to physically spin a roulette wheel so as to generate a random roulette outcome. For example the player may have the opportunity to physically jostle a basket with dice so as to generate a new roll of the dice. A player may exert indirect control over a machine that generates random outcomes by sending commands to the machine. Commands may be sent via a terminal such as via a mobile device. For example a player may press a button at a remote terminal that instructs a machine controlled roulette wheel to spin. The remote terminal may relay the request of the player to the casino server. The casino server may in turn instruct the machine controlling the roulette wheel to spin the roulette wheel.

In various embodiments a player may not only issue commands to generate an outcome but may also issue commands as to how the outcome should be generated. The player may specify for example a degree of physical force that will be applied with an outcome generating device. For example a player may specify that speed e.g. in terms of revolutions per second with which a roulette wheel will be spun. A player may specify that amount of time that a basket with dice will be shaken before the dice are allowed to come to rest. A player may specify the amount of time cards must be shuffled before they can be dealt. Thus in various embodiments a player may specify inputs that fall along a range of possible inputs. For example the speed or the force with which a roulette wheel is spun may vary over a continuous range. The player may specify a speed or force. The player may specify a force using a dial a mouse or another input device which can provide a continuous range of inputs. For example a player may use a mouse to manipulate the level of a bar on a display screen of the terminal. If the bar is at a high level then a roulette wheel will be spun with a high initial speed. If the bar is at a low level then the bar will be spun with a low initial speed.

In various embodiments a player s status may determine what kind of control he is allowed to exert over an outcome generating device. For example in various embodiments if a player is a high roller e.g. if the player places more than a predetermined total amount of wagers per visit to a casino then the player may be allowed to define a variable input into an outcome generating device. However a player who is not a high roller may be allowed only to tell a device whether or not to generate an outcome.

In various embodiments one or more statistics may be used to summarize a set of games outcomes player earnings or other occurrences at a casino. The statistic may be called an index. Thus for example there may be a Roulette Red Index which summarizes the proportion of the time that roulette wheels across the casino have landed on red in a given time period. There may be a Blackjack Index which summarizes the proportion of times that a Blackjack has been dealt to a player across the casino. Other indexes may summarize data about a the number of times a particular outcome has occurred e.g. the number of times the a jackpot outcome has occurred b the amount of money one or more players have won e.g. the average amount of money slot machine players have won in the last hour c the number of times a particular symbol has occurred e.g. the number of times a cherry symbol has occurred at a bank of slot machines d the number of times a particular intermediate outcome has occurred e.g. the number of times a particular starting hand of video poker has occurred e the number of times a player has achieved a certain hand e.g. the number of times a player of Texas Hold em has achieved a full house e.g. the number of times a player at blackjack has achieved a point total of 20 f the number of times a dealer has achieved a certain outcome e.g. the number of times a dealer has achieved a point total of 20 in a game of blackjack h the number of times a particular score has been reached in a game of sports e.g. in a game of sports on which players can bet in a sports book i the number of players who have won more than 100 and so on. An index may summarize data from a given time period such as from the current day. For example an index may summarize the proportion of times that a seven has been rolled on the first roll in craps during the current day. An index may summarize data in absolute numbers. For example an index may describe the total number of spins at a roulette wheel that have resulted in the number 12 during the current day. Such an index may be called the 12 index for example. An index may summarize data as a proportion. The index may indicate a ratio of the occurrence of one outcome to the occurrence of another outcome. The index may indicate the ratio of the occurrence of one outcome to a number of games played. For example an index value of 2.7 may indicate that the number 12 has occurred in 2.7 of roulette spins during the current day.

In various embodiments an index may summarize data from a particular area of a casino. For example an index may summarize player winnings from the first floor of a casino or from a particular bank of slot machines. An index may summarize data from a particular type of machine. An index may summarize data from slot machines. An index may summarize data from video poker machines. An index may summarize data from table games. An index may summarize data from progressive slot machines. An index may summarize data from video slot machines.

In various embodiments an index may include a weighting of certain events games or outcomes over others. An outcome may be weighted depending on the number of bets that have been placed on it. For example if the number 17 occurs at a roulette wheel with 5 people playing the 17 index may increase by 5 times as much as does the 8 index when it occurs at another roulette wheel at which only one person is betting. In various embodiments game or outcome may be weighted in the index based on the size of the wager placed on the game or index. For example if a person bets 100 and receives a blackjack a blackjack index may go up by 10 times as much as it would when a person places a 10 bet and receives a blackjack. A game or outcome may also be weighted according to the size of one or more payouts that are possible in the game. For example an outcome at a game which has a jackpot of 10 000 may receive twice the weighting as does an outcome which has a jackpot of 5 000.

In various embodiments there may be an index associated with a particular player. For example a primary player may have an index. A secondary player may decide whether or not to participate in the games of the primary player based on the level of the index.

In some embodiments there may be an index for a group of players. For example there may be an index for all players within a certain age range for all people from a certain geographic location for all people of a certain gender for all people that prefer a particular type of game e.g. blackjack and so on. In some embodiments there may be an index for groups of players based on their amounts wagered. For example a large cap index may summarize statistics about players who bet 25 or more per game. A small cap index may summarize statistics about all other players.

In various embodiments a player may be given improved payout odds on a game in return for paying a fixed commission. For example in a game of roulette a player who has bet 1 on a winning number might typically receive his 1 back plus an additional 35. In some embodiments the payout for achieving a winning number in a game of roulette might increase to 37. In this way a player could expect to lose 1 with probability 37 38 and to make 37 with probability 1 38 assuming an American roulette wheel with 38 spaces on it. The player would thus have expected winnings and expected losses of 0 making the bet a bet with true odds. However in general a casino may wish to maintain a house advantage on a bet so as to generate profits for the casino. Accordingly the casino may offer a payout of 37 when the player wins but may charge the player a 2 commission whenever the player wins. Thus the casino may maintain a house advantage by charging a commission even though the bet was made at true odds.

Thus in various embodiments a player may place a bet with true odds. In other words a player may place a bet such that his expectation from the game is zero. However for one or more outcomes the player may owe a commission to the casino. The commission may be deducted from the amount paid in a winning outcome.

In various embodiments a player may make a bet with a positive expectation. In other words the player may make a bet such that the player has an advantage i.e. such that the player can expect to win on average more than the amount of his bet. However the house may profit from the game by charging a commission to play the game. The commission may exceed the amount that the player might expect to profit from the game. For example a player may make a 1 bet in a game in which the player can expect to win 1.05 on average. Thus the player has an advantage in the game. However the casino may charge the player a 0.10 commission to play the game. Thus accounting for the commission the casino will still be able to profit from the game on average.

In some embodiments a player may make a bet in a game in which the player is guaranteed to win back more than the amount of his bet. For example if the player places a bet of 1 the player may be guaranteed to win back at least 1.05 for a net profit of 0.05. However the player may be charged a commission for the game. For example the commission may be equal to 1.05. The commission may serve to make the game profitable for the casino when the commission is taken into account.

Any data generated or gathered at a casino or from any other source may be displayed to one or more players. The data may also be displayed for viewing by one or more casino representatives. Data may also be communicated in other ways such as through announcements over a public address system or such as over radio waves. As described herein the data displayed may include data about historical outcomes summary statistics data about the performance of one or more players data about the performance of one or more gaming devices data about the performances of one or more dealers data about the size of one or more jackpots data about data trends data about one or more outcomes data about one or more historical outcomes and so on.

Data may be displayed in a number of areas. Data may be displayed a on the display screens of gaming devices e.g. on the display screens of gaming devices that are not currently in use b on wall mounted monitors c on electronic signs d on walls ceilings or other services via projection displays e on the screens of terminals at which secondary players participate in games f on the screens of mobile devices g on the televisions screens of hotel room televisions h on display screens inside elevators and so on. Data or representations of data e.g. graphs tables etc. may be printed on paper or other materials and may be distributed or otherwise made available. Data may be printed on restaurant menus. For example a restaurant menu may feature the name of the primary player who won the most consecutive games of blackjack during the day. Data may be posted on signs located above gaming devices. For example a sign above a gaming device may indicate that the gaming device has paid out more than 2000 in the past 24 hours. Data may be displayed on signs located above banks of gaming devices. For example above a bank of gaming devices a sign may indicate the name of the player who has had the best record of winnings at the bank of gaming devices within the past 24 hours.

In various embodiments data gathered or recorded may be made available on a network such as on the Internet. A person may access the data by going to a particular address on the network such as to a particular Uniform Resource Locator URL address. The address may contain data viewable in a particular format such as in HTML format. The data may be accessible by an Internet browser such as via Internet Explorer . In various embodiments data may be accessible through various links. Each link may lead to a different address on the network. A given link may provide access to data of a certain type. For example a given link may lead to data about individual players performances. Another link might provide access to data about the performances of gaming devices. Another link might provide access to data about the performance of a dealer. In various embodiments a first link might lead to data gathered at a first casino e.g. data about games at the first casino and a second link might lead to data gathered at a second casino.

In various embodiments a casino that is associated with a hotel might transmit gaming data over one or more television channels. For example a channel on a cable television system might be devoted to providing or displaying casino data. In some embodiments a first channel might be devoted to a first type of data a second channel to a second type of data and so on. For example a first channel might display data about the outcomes generated at a set of blackjack tables. A second channel might display data about the outcomes generated at a set of roulette tables.

In various embodiments data may be displayed with a certain prominence if the data is of a certain level of significance. For example a casino may contain a large sign in a central location that is widely visible throughout the casino. The sign may be used to display only the most significant data. For example the sign may display the last ten people to have won more than 1000. The casino may contain further signs in less prominent locations. For example a digital sign may be visible only in the general area of a particular bank of slot machines. The sign may display the names of the last ten players to win more than 100 at the bank of slot machines. Thus in various embodiments data may be displayed at a particular location if the data has been gathered in the vicinity such as at nearby gaming devices or table games.

In various embodiments deductions or conclusions based on data may be displayed. For example suppose that during the last 15 minutes blackjack players across a casino have won 60 of the blackjack games played. The deduction may be made that blackjack players in general are on a hot streak. Thus a message may be displayed e.g. on a sign e.g. on the screen of a mobile device e.g. on the screen of a terminal that blackjack players are hot. Examples of other messages include Dealer Joe Smith is dealing great hands tonight Sue Baker is having the night of her life Red is the in color at roulette Billy Bob just won a doozy of a jackpot at slots Sue Smith is going home rich tonight and so on.

In various embodiments data may be printed on pamphlets receipts or other paper document or material. A player or other person may desire a certain type of data. For example a player may wish to have a record of his own outcomes for a period of time. For example a player may wish to have a record of all the hands of video poker he has been dealt throughout the day. Accordingly the player may request such a record. For example the player might go to a casino cage and provide identification e.g. in the form of a player tracking card . The casino cage may access data stored about the player on the casino server. The casino may then print out data about the player s outcomes from the day. The casino may then provide the player with the records. In various embodiments a first person might wish to have a record of data about one or more other people. For example the person might want a pamphlet showing the results of the top 100 players at the casino for the day. The pamphlet might show a name or alias of each of the 100 people together with an amount won by each person. In various embodiments a person might want a record about a particular machine a particular dealer a particular sector of a casino a particular gaming table or a particular group of people. The record may contain data about the requested people device or entity such data including outcomes achieved winnings losses number of games won in a row number of games lost in a row strategy used and so on.

In various embodiments an alert may be generated based on events or outcomes that occur in a game or at a casino. For example a secondary player may wish to be alerted when any primary player has won more than 5 games in a row at a slot machine. Accordingly the casino server the device of the secondary player e.g. a mobile gaming device or any other device may track data as it is received e.g. from gaming devices . The casino server may process the data and determine whether alert criteria have been met. For example the casino server may determine whether a win for a primary player constitutes a fifth consecutive win by examining data from the most recent game of the primary player plus data from the four prior games of the primary player. If all of the games were winning games for the primary player then the casino server may generate an alert for the secondary player. An alert may take the form of a message transmitted to a secondary player. For example a text message may pop up on the screen of a mobile gaming device of the secondary player. An alert may also be displayed or broadcast for a wider audience. For example an alert may be broadcast on an electronic sign hanging in a casino. An alert may also be broadcast over radio or other channel for audio broadcasts.

In various embodiments a trend may comprise a set of games or outcomes that have a common characteristic and which occur proximate in time and or which occur consecutively. Common characteristics of outcomes may include a the outcomes are all the same b the outcomes have one or more common symbols c the outcomes have the same associated payout d the outcomes have a positive associated payout d the outcome all have a payout above a certain level e.g. above 10 units e the outcomes all lead to bonus rounds f the outcomes are all losing outcomes g the outcomes are all winning outcomes h the outcomes are all near misses and so on. Common characteristics of games may include a the games have the same outcome b the games have the same payout c the games have a common intermediate outcome e.g. games of video poker all start out with three cards to a flush d the games all have winning payouts e the games all have losing payouts f the games each contain multiple winning outcomes g the games all reached bonus rounds h the games were all near misses and so on.

In various embodiments a player may bet that a trend will continue. A player may bet that an outcome which will be generated in the future will share a common characteristic with a set of outcomes that had been generated in the past. For example a player may bet that the same outcome which has occurred in the last five games at a craps table e.g. the pass line has won will occur in the sixth game. For example a player may bet that a point total that a dealer has achieved in the last 5 games of blackjack e.g. a point total of 18 will be achieved by a dealer in the next game of blackjack. In various embodiments a player may bet that a trend will continue for a particular length of time. For example a player may bet that a trend will continue for three more games. A player may bet on the exact number of games for which a trend will continue. For example a player may bet that a trend will continue for the next two games before the trend is broken. A player may bet on a minimum number of games for which a trend will continue. For example a player may bet that a trend will continue for a minimum of the next five games. A player may also bet on the maximum number of games that a trend will continue. For example a player may bet that a trend will continue for no more than 3 games. In various embodiments a player may bet that a trend will not continue. The player may bet that an outcome which will be generated in the future will not share a common characteristic with a set of outcomes that had been generated in the past.

In various embodiments a player may bet on the continuance or discontinuance of a trend that had occurred in the past. For example a secondary player may find a series of consecutive games of roulette played by a primary player in which the outcome was red for 10 consecutive games. The secondary player may not be informed of the results of the game following the 10 consecutive games of red. However the results of the 11game may be on record e.g. in a memory of the casino server . The secondary player may then place a bet on the continuance of the trend. For example the secondary player may place a bet that the 11game also resulted in a red outcome. For example the secondary player may place a bet that the next five games also resulted in a red outcome. The secondary player may also bet on the discontinuance of the trend. For example the secondary player may bet that the 11game would not result in a red outcome.

In various embodiments a trend may describe a number of consecutive wins or a number of consecutive losses. The consecutive wins or losses may represent those of a player those of a dealer those of a particular gaming device and or those of a particular type of game. For example a statistic may describe the number of consecutive games that have been won at a particular slot machine regardless of who has played those games. For example a statistic may describe the number of consecutive games that a dealer has won at a blackjack table. A player such as a secondary player may bet on the continuance or the discontinuance of a trend of consecutive winnings and losses. For example a secondary player may bet that a primary player who has just lost 10 games in a row will lose the 11game in a row. For example a secondary player may bet that a craps game will end up with the pass line bet losing even though the pass line bet has won for the past 10 games.

In various embodiments a trend may describe a regular pattern of characteristics among a series of outcomes. The pattern of characteristics need not be such that each outcome has the same characteristic. Rather the pattern may indicate a regularly varying set of characteristics. For example a trend may consist of a series of outcomes at a roulette wheel such that every second outcome is a red outcome and every outcome between red outcomes is a black outcome. In other words the trend represents a pattern whereby after each red outcome a black outcome occurs and after each black outcome a red outcome occurs. A player such as a secondary player may bet on the continuance of such a trend. For example if the most recent outcome has been a red outcome then the player may bet that the next outcome will be a black outcome. A player may bet that such a trend will continue for multiple outcomes. For example a player may bet that outcomes will alternate between red and black for the next 10 consecutive outcomes.

In various embodiments a trend may include any pattern. A player may bet on the continuance or discontinuance of any pattern. The player may bet that a pattern will continue for any number of games in the future or that the pattern will discontinue at a designated point in the future. A payout provided to a player who has bet correctly may depend on the nature of the pattern and on the number of games or outcomes into the future that the player has bet the pattern will continue. For example a winning player who has bet that a pattern will continue relatively far into the future may receive a higher payout than does a player who has bet that a pattern will continue one or only a few games into the future. For example if each outcome that would continue a pattern is a relatively rare outcome e.g. the player has bet that a pattern of green outcomes occurring will continue at a roulette wheel then the player may receive a larger payout than does a player who bets on the continuation of a pattern with relatively common outcomes e.g. a pattern of blackjack games where the dealer wins .

In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on a trend or pattern in the winnings of a primary player. For example a secondary player may bet that a primary player will have positive net winnings for each of the next four five minute periods. The primary player may have achieved positive net winnings for the prior 10 five minute periods or the secondary player may simply be betting on a new trend occurring. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on a trend in a primary player s balance or bankroll. For example a secondary player may bet that a primary player s bankroll will increase in every ten minute period for the next hour. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on a see saw trend in the winnings or in the bankroll of a primary player. For example a secondary player may bet that the bankroll of a primary player will increase in the next five minute period decrease in the following five minute period then increase in the following five minute period and so on. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet that the bankroll of a primary player or the bankroll of another secondary player will reach certain points one after the other. There may however be no particular designated time period when the bankroll has to reach the points. For example a secondary player may bet that the bankroll of a primary player will reach 100 then will reach 50 then will reach 150 then will reach 25 then will reach 155 and so on. The secondary player may win if the primary player s bankroll reaches those points in order. However the secondary player may lose his bet if the bankroll of the primary player reaches the points out of order. For example the secondary player may lose his bet if the primary player s bankroll reaches 155 before it reaches 25. Embodiments described herein with respect to a bankroll may also apply to a balance at a gaming device to an amount of chips at a gaming table to an amount of net winnings and so on. For example a secondary player may bet that the net winnings of a primary player will reach a first point followed by a second point followed by a third point and so on.

In various embodiments data may be gathered for sports. For example data may include a sports score a number of yards rushed by a particular player in a game of football a number of runs hit by a particular baseball player a number of aces served by a tennis player a number under par achieved by a golf player and so on. Data may be aggregated over various games. For example the total runs hit by any player in major league baseball during a particular day may be added up and may define the value of a statistic. A secondary player may bet on values of the statistic. Other exemplary data may include the number of punches connected in a boxing match the number or three pointers shot in a game of basketball the number of collisions in a car race and so on.

In various embodiments a secondary player may designate a category for a game of a primary player in which to participate such that a game falling into the category has certain characteristics. The game may be a game with a certain beginning state. The game may be a game for which certain resolutions have occurred for events in the game. In some embodiments a secondary player may designate a particular starting hand or category of starting hand in a game of video poker. For example a secondary player may designate a hand that includes three cards of the same rank. Accordingly the casino server may search for a game of a primary player which has featured a starting hand with three cards of the same rank. In some embodiments the secondary player may designate a particular starting point total in a game of blackjack. Accordingly the casino server may search for a game of a primary player which has featured a starting hand with the particular starting point total. For example a secondary player may designate a particular dealer up card in a game of blackjack. Accordingly the casino server may search for a game of a primary player in which the designated dealer up card has been dealt. In some embodiments a secondary player may designate a category of game at a slot machine in which a cherry symbol has occurred on the first reel of the slot machine. Accordingly the casino server may search for a game of a primary player in which a cherry symbol has occurred on the first reel of the slot machine. In various embodiments a secondary player may place a constraint on games in which he wishes to participate. The casino server may then find one or more games for the secondary player meeting such constraints. In some embodiments the secondary player may place a constraint such that the primary player has won at least X amount in the game. In some embodiments the secondary player may place a constraint on the game such that the primary player has received a particular card in the game. As will be appreciated many other constraints may be placed on the game.

In various embodiments a category of game that a secondary player has designated may have an increased likelihood of ending with a particular outcome than does a game chosen purely at random. In various embodiments a category of game that a secondary player has designated may have an increased likelihood of ending with a particular outcome than does a game started from scratch. For example if a secondary player indicates a desire to participate in a slot machine game where the first symbol is cherry then the secondary player may be more likely to finish the game with a winning outcome than he would be had he participated in a game started from scratch. For example if a secondary player indicates a desire to participate in a video poker game where the initial hand contains three cards of the same rank then the secondary player is guaranteed if he so desires to finish the game with three of a kind.

Thus in various embodiments when a secondary player has the opportunity to participate in a certain category of game designated by the secondary player the secondary player may derive an increased advantage in the game all else being equal. For example the secondary player may assure that he will participate in a winning game by designating a category of game that will always be winning. In various embodiments the house may alter a game chosen according to a secondary player s designation in such a way as to increase the house advantage in the game. The house may alter the game in such a way as to provide the house with an equal or approximately equal advantage to what the house would have had if a game had been started from scratch. For example if the house normally has an advantage of 5 in a slot machine game and a secondary player chooses to play a particular game in which a cherry symbol will occur on the first reel then the house may alter the probabilities of various subsequent symbols payouts associated with one or more outcomes or required bet amounts in such a way as to maintain the house advantage for the game near 5 .

In some embodiments a secondary player may choose a constraint on a game. For example a secondary player may apply a constraint on a game such that the game must be a game of blackjack in which the initial hand has a point total of 11. The house may make an alteration to the game such that the probabilities of various outcomes of the games shift in the favor of the house. For example in the aforementioned example of a blackjack game in which the initial primary player hand has a point total of 11 the house may alter the remaining portion of the deck of cards by removing all ten valued cards. This may shift the advantage towards the house though not necessarily make the house the favorite because it would lessen the player s chance of achieving 21 points and would also lessen the dealer s chance of busting. Thus the house may have made an alteration to the game that decreases the player s chance of achieving a particular outcome or category of outcome. At the same time the alteration may increase the player s chance of achieving a particular outcome or category of outcome e.g. a hand with less than a 21 point total . In various embodiments the house may make an alteration to a game in order to increase or decrease the probability of one or more outcomes. In various embodiments the house may alter a probability directly e.g. by changing probabilities used in a random number generator used to create game outcomes or may make an alteration which has the effect of altering a probability of an outcome e.g. the house adds or removes cards from a deck of cards which has the effect of changing the probability of an outcome .

In some embodiments a payout associated with an outcome may change. For example suppose a secondary player indicates a desire to participate in a game in which the point total for the primary player s initial hand was 11. In response the house may reduce the payout associated with a player win. Rather than paying 10 for example a winning outcome may only pay 10.

In some embodiments a required bet amount may change. For example suppose a secondary player wishes to participate in a slot machine game in which the first two symbols are bell symbols. Rather than requiring the secondary player to bet 1 as might be typical for the game the house may require the secondary player to bet 5. Meanwhile the payouts may not change vis vis a game in which the secondary player set no particular constraint.

In some embodiments a rule of the game may change. For example a secondary player wishes to participate in a game of blackjack in which the dealer begins with a point total of 13. A rule may change which allows the dealer to make any decision at any time including hitting with an 18 if a player has a 19. By changing a rule of a game the house may effectively alter the probabilities of one or more outcomes.

In some embodiments a payout ratio may change. For example a particular outcome may pay 5 to 1 given a constraint imposed by a secondary player whereas ordinarily the same outcome might pay 20 to 1.

In various embodiments changes made to rules probabilities payouts and payout ratios may favor the player. For example the secondary player may apply a constraint to a game which is unfavorable to the secondary player. For example the secondary player may indicate a desire to participate in a game of blackjack where he begins with a point total of 15 with no aces. Such a starting hand is considered a bad hand and significantly lowers the secondary player s chances of winning. According for example a payout associated with a player win may be increased so as to compensate the secondary player for the disadvantageous starting hand.

It should be recognized that while some example embodiments may refer to a secondary player and or a secondary game some embodiments may not include such a secondary game and or player but rather some embodiments may include a single game and or player. For example a single player may select to play a game having a desired set of opening cards and or other characteristics. That game may not be a game played by another player but as an alternative may be a game generated for the player.

In various embodiments a secondary player may indicate desired odds for achieving one or more outcomes in a game. In various embodiments a secondary player may indicate desired odds for achieving any of a set of outcomes such as desired odds for achieving any winning outcome. For example a secondary player may indicate that he wants his odds of achieving a winning outcome to be 1 2 i.e. he wishes to achieve one winning outcome for every two losing outcomes on average. The casino may accordingly select a set of games of a primary player such that within the set of games there is one winning game for every two losing games. The casino may then randomly select a game from among the set of games and allow the secondary player to participate in the selected game. In various embodiments the casino may adjust or determine a payout of an outcome of a game in response to the secondary player selecting the odds for an outcome of the game. Note that the payout adjustment need not necessarily occur for the same outcome for which the secondary player has selected odds. For example the secondary player may indicate desired odds for a first outcome and the casino may adjust the payout for a second outcome. In various embodiments the casino may adjust the payout for one or more outcomes so as to counteract the advantage that the secondary player may obtain from selecting the odds of an outcome. For example if the secondary player indicates desired odds for achieving an outcome where such odds are greater than the standard or typical odds of achieving such outcome then the casino may reduce a payout for one or more outcomes from what the typical payout would be. If a secondary player indicates desired odds for an outcome where such odds work to the secondary player s disadvantage e.g. the secondary player has indicated desired odds for a winning outcome that are less than the typical odds for the winning outcome then the casino may change a payout associated with one or more outcomes in the secondary player s favor e.g. the casino may increase one or more payouts. In some embodiments the casino may adjust one or more payouts so as to maintain a constant or near constant house advantage. For example the casino may change payouts so as to assure that the house advantage after adjustments in the odds of an outcome and in payouts is nearly the same as the house advantage was before the adjustments in odds and payouts. In some embodiments if the secondary player indicates a desire for increased odds of a first outcome then the casino may decrease the odds of a second outcome. For example the casino may find a set of games of a primary player in which the first outcome occurs more than usual but in which the second outcome occurs less than usual. The casino may then select a game at random from the set of games so as to allow the secondary player to participate. It will be appreciated that in the embodiments described herein the secondary player could just as readily indicate a desired probability for one or more outcomes instead of indicating desired odds. It will be appreciated that a simple mathematical transformation can transform odds into probabilities and vice versa.

In various embodiments a secondary player may indicate desired payout for an outcome. For example the secondary player may indicate a desire for a payout that is greater than the payout ordinarily associated with the outcome. Accordingly the casino may adjust the probability of the outcome occurring. For example the casino may reduce the probability of the outcome occurring. In various embodiments the casino may reduce the probability of an outcome by selecting a pool of games of one or more primary players in which the outcome has occurred less frequently than would ordinarily be expected. The casino may then select a game at random from among the pool of games and allow the secondary player to participate in the selected game. In various embodiments the casino may adjust the probability of an outcome that is different from the outcome whose payout the secondary player has asked to be adjusted. For example the secondary player may indicate that he wishes to increase the payout for a first outcome. The casino may then adjust the probability of a second outcome. The second outcome may be a winning outcome. In various embodiments the casino may make an adjustment to the probability of occurrence of one or more outcomes so as to counteract adjustments made to payouts in the secondary player s favor. In various embodiments the casino seeks to maintain the same or nearly the same house advantage before and after any adjustments made by the secondary player and the house. For example if a house advantage is ordinarily 5 for a game then the house may seek to counteract any adjustments made to payouts by the secondary player so as to maintain the house advantage for the game at 5 .

In various embodiments a secondary player may set a payout a probability and or odds using a dial. The dial may allow the secondary player to adjust a setting along a continuum or near continuum by turning the dial to the appropriate degree. The secondary player might also use a scroll bar a mouse an arrow key or any other input device in order to indicate a setting. In response to the secondary player adjusting a first setting the house may adjust a second setting so as for example to maintain a constant house advantage. The house may adjust a setting for a probability by selecting an appropriate pool of games of a primary player such that a frequency of occurrence of one or more outcomes is equal to a desired frequency. The house may adjust a payout by simply providing a different payout than is typical in the event of the occurrence of a particular outcome.

In various embodiments the house may change the odds of one or more outcomes by altering the composition of a deck of cards. For example the house may add or remove cards from a deck of cards. In some embodiments a secondary player may designate a particular category of starting hand of a game. For example in a game of blackjack a secondary player may indicate a desire to start with a point total of 18. The house may adjust the composition of the unused portion of the deck in response. For example the house may add cards with rank three to the deck in order to lessen the dealer s chances of busting.

In some embodiments a secondary player may indicate a desired starting hand for both the secondary player and for the dealer. For example the secondary player may indicate a starting point total for the secondary player and the secondary player may indicate a particular up card for the dealer. In some embodiments the secondary player may indicate a starting hand for the secondary player and a complete starting hand for the dealer. In some embodiments the secondary player may indicate a starting hand plus an additional card for the secondary player. For example the secondary player may indicate a starting hand with two nines plus an additional card of a 10 e.g. after the secondary has split his initial two cards . In some embodiments a secondary player may indicate a starting hand for the dealer plus an additional card. In some embodiments a secondary player may indicate any sequence of initial cards for the primary player and or any sequence of initial cards for the dealer. The secondary player may specify a point total a number of cards the ranks of cards particular cards e.g. both rank and suit and so on. For any indications provided by the secondary player the casino may search for a game of a primary player that suits the indications. For example if the secondary player has indicated a desire to participate in a game where a primary player has a starting point total of 18 then the house may search for a game of a primary player with the starting point total of 18.

In various embodiments a viewable record may be created for a primary player. The record may include historical performance metrics for the primary player. The record may constitute a profit and loss statement for the primary player. The record may include an indication of an amount won by the primary player over a certain period of time. The record may include an indication of an amount lost by the primary player over a certain period of time. The record may include an indication of a total amount wagered by the primary player over a certain period of time. The time period covered by the record may be a a particular hour b a particular day c a particular week d a particular weekend e the duration of a primary player s stay at a casino f the duration of a primary player s play session at a casino g the duration of a primary player s session at a particular gaming device and so on. The record may include a breakdown of performance metrics into various categories. The record may show performance metrics by time period by wager amount by gaming device by dealer by casino by type of gaming device e.g. reel slot machine versus video slot machine or by any other category. For example the record may include a first set of data describing the primary player s winnings at blackjack during the last day a second set of data describing the primary player s winnings at video poker during the last day a third set of data describing the primary player s winnings at roulette during the last day and so on. In some embodiments the record may include a listing of individual games played by a primary player e.g. all games played by the primary player . The listing may include data associated with each game including an amount wagered an amount won an amount lost an outcome received a time of the game a decision made an initial hand received in the game a final hand received in the game an action by a dealer a hand of an opponent a decision of an opponent an amount raised and so on. The listing may segregate games into different categories. For example data about all games played at a slot machine may be listed together while data about all games played at a table game may be listed together.

The record for a primary player may be viewable by the primary player. For example the primary player may be able to call up a view of the record on the screen of any gaming device any terminal any mobile device any Internet connected device and so on. The record may be printable for example onto a cashless gaming ticket. In some embodiments the record for a primary player may be viewable by a secondary player. For example the secondary player may search for the name of a primary player and then view the record for the primary player.

In various embodiments a primary player may specify limits. The limits may be visible in the record of the primary player. A limit may include a stop limit. The limit may force or encourage the primary player to stop playing if certain criteria are met. For example the limit may encourage the primary player to stop playing if he has lost 100. In various embodiments an alert may be sent to a primary player once performance metrics of the primary player meet certain criteria. For example an alert might be sent to the primary player once the primary player has accumulated winnings of 500. The alert may tell the primary player that he wanted to stop playing once his winnings reached 500.

In some embodiments a secondary player may receive an alert based on the performance of a primary player. For example the secondary player may receive an alert when a primary player has won 10 games in a row when a primary player has lost 10 games in a row when a primary player s fortunes have swung back and forth three times between winnings and losses and or when any other condition has been met. In various embodiments a secondary player may specify an alert condition. The secondary player may then be alerted if the alert condition is met. For example once a primary player satisfies an alert condition the secondary player may be alerted that the primary player has satisfied the secondary player s alert condition. The secondary player may then be given the opportunity to participate in the next game of the primary player. A secondary player may be alerted if a primary player has just won a large payout if the primary player has won a designated number of large payouts in a particular period of time if the primary player has won more than a certain amount in the prior hour and so on. A secondary player may be alerted if a primary player has lost more than a certain amount in the last hour if the secondary player has had more than 90 of his outcomes be losing outcomes in the last 30 minutes if the primary player has just had a near miss and so on.

Various embodiments describe the use of data in a gaming context such as in the context of casino gaming mobile gaming charity bingo or on line gaming. In various embodiments data generated in a first game may be used in a second game. For example a set of data may be generated in a first game. The set of data may be used to determine an outcome of the first game. The same set of data may also be used to determine an outcome of a second game. For example in a game of blackjack 14 cards may be dealt. Data indicating the ranks and suits of the 14 cards may be recorded. Such data may later be used to conduct a game of video poker. In conducting the game of video poker data about a first 5 of the 14 cards may be presented to a player leaving 9 cards remaining. The player may select 3 discards after which data about 3 replacement cards may be presented to the player from the data about the 9 cards remaining. In various embodiments data in a first game may be generated through physical means. Generation of data through physical means may include generating data through a process that is not solely based on the manipulation of electrons and photons. The generation of data through physical means may include the generating an outcome at a roulette wheel the dealing of one or more cards from a deck of cards the rolling of a die or any other physical or partly physical process. The generation of data through physical means may include the generation of a roulette outcome through the manual spinning of a roulette wheel e.g. by a casino employee. The generation of data through physical means may include the generation of a roulette outcome through the automatic spinning of a roulette wheel e.g. by computer controlled motors. The generation of data through physical means may include the rolling of dice by a human such as a craps player. The generation of data through physical means may include the rolling of dice automatically e.g. through the motorized spinning of a transparent enclosure containing dice.

In various embodiments the outcomes and or the resolutions of events in a first game may be used as inputs for generating outcomes and or resolutions of events in a second game. For example the outcomes and or resolutions of events in a first game may serve as random numbers for use in an algorithm for generating outcomes and or resolutions in a second game. In some embodiments the outcomes and or resolutions of events in a first game may be directly used as outcomes or resolutions in a second game e.g. without any further transformations . In various embodiments a first game may include a game of a player or a game that has been conducted automatically e.g. without participation by any player . In various embodiments a first game may include a game where outcomes or resolutions have been generated through physical processes e.g. as opposed to electronic processes . For example the first game may include outcomes or resolutions that have been generated through a roll of dice through a spin of a roulette wheel through the dealing of cards or through any other physical process.

Data may be recorded from a first game in various ways. In some embodiments a human may manually enter data from a game. For example a casino employee may use a key board to key in the numbers 4 and 3 representing the numbers rolled on two dice in a game of craps. In some embodiments a sensor or reader may detect and record data from a game. A roulette reader may detect and record the spaces in which a roulette ball has landed following a spin of a roulette wheel. An exemplary roulette sensing apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 396 193 to Reinhardt et al. entitled Roulette wheel directional sensing apparatus . U.S. Pat. No. 4 396 193 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. A card shoe may be equipped with sensors and or algorithms for reading cards dealt from the shoe and determining data about the cards such as rank and suit. An exemplary such card shoe is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 029 009 to Grauzer et al. entitled Playing card dealing shoe with automated internal card feeding and card reading . U.S. Pat. No. 7 029 009 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In various embodiments a camera may capture images of a game being played. Data may be extracted from such images including data about cards dealt data about rolls of dice and data about a number generated at a roulette wheel. Such data may be extracted using image processing algorithms for example. U.S. Pat. No. 4 531 187 to Uhland entitled Game monitoring apparatus describes a means for optically monitoring the cards played in a game. U.S. Pat. No. 4 531 187 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In various embodiments a camera may record footage of a first game being played. For example a camera may record footage of dice being rolled of cards being dealt of a roulette wheel being spun and so on. In various embodiments the footage may be stored. In various embodiments the footage may be stored in association with one or more tags or other data including a date during which the filmed game was played a time during which the game was played a game identifier an identifier for a player in the game e.g. a player s name an identifier for a dealer in the game a location of the game a casino in which the game was played an indication of the type of game being played e.g. blackjack e.g. craps and so on. Subsequent to the video footage being recorded a player involved in a second game may indicate a desire to see the video footage. The player in the second game may be involved in a game that uses data from the game depicted in the video footage. For example the player involved in the second game may be involved in a game of video poker that uses the same cards originally dealt in a game of blackjack. The player may desire to see film footage of the game of blackjack. The player may desire to see the film footage so as to verify that the cards dealt in the game of blackjack which are the same cards now being used in his own game were dealt fairly. Any tags stored in association with the video footage may aid the house or casino in retrieving the video footage upon a player s request. For example data used in a second game may be tagged with an identifier of a first game. A player in the second game may request to see video footage of how that data was generated in the first game. Accordingly a casino may search for video footage that is stored in association with the identifier. Any such video footage may then be retrieved and shown to the player in the second game.

In various embodiments data generated in a first game may be used in a second game. One or more algorithms may be used to transform the data from the first game into data suitable for use in the second game. For example data from a first game may include number in a first range. Data suitable for use in a second game may include numbers in a second range. Accordingly for example data from the first range may be mapped to the second range using a mathematical transformation such as multiplication or division by a constant. For example data from a first game may include data about cards dealt in the first game e.g. the first game is game of blackjack . Such data may take the form of numbers where the numbers 1 through 52 each represent a different card in a standard deck of 52 cards. Data required for the second game may include numerical data in the range of 1 to 6 since the second game may be a dice game e.g. craps . Accordingly data from the range of 1 to 52 may be mapped to data in the range of 1 to 6. The mapping may occur as follows. It will be appreciated that many other mappings are possible. A number from 1 to 52 is completely discarded if the number is 49 50 51 or 52. If a number is discarded a second number is then used e.g. a number representing a different card that was dealt in the first game . If a number is not discarded the number is divided by eight and the result is rounded up to the nearest integer. Thus the number 1 will map to the number 1 the number 2 will map to the number 1 the number 8 will map to the number 1 the number 9 will map to the number 2 the number 17 will map to the number 3 and the number 48 will map to the number 6. A mapping has thus been accomplished from a game of cards to a game of dice. Two or more cards may be used from the game of cards more than two cards may be needed if one of the cards is represented by a number greater than 48 to conduct a roll of dice in a game of craps.

Once data suitable for use in the second game is obtained an appropriate skin may be used with the second game. The skin may include graphics and play patterns that make the second game more familiar to the player of the second game. For example once data has been generated which includes numbers between 1 and 6 the casino or a device of the casino such as a gaming device may be used to graphically render the generation of outcomes that corresponds to the data. For example if numbers 3 and 6 have been generated as data suitable for a second game the casino may show graphical depictions of the numbers 3 and 6 being rolled on a pair of dice. Thus the player may engage in a game of craps.

Note that in various embodiments data used in a second game may be based on data that has been derived from a first game which was played in the past. Thus the outcome of the second game may be pre determined in some sense. However since the player of the second game may not be familiar with the first game or since the player may not be familiar with the algorithm used to transform data from the first game into data used in the second game the player may be unable to take advantage of advanced knowledge of the outcome of the second game.

In various embodiments data generated in a first game may be used in a second game that is played on a gaming device. The gaming device may be a slot machine video poker machine video bingo machine mobile gaming device e.g. a mobile gaming device as defined by Nevada bill AB 471 and so on. In various embodiments data generated in a first game may be used in a second game that is played over a network. Data generated in a first game may be used in Internet gaming such as in conducting a second game at an on line casino. Similarly video footage from the first game may be available for a player who participates in the second game at the on line casino. By viewing the video footage the player may become more confident that the data being used in the second game was generated fairly.

In various embodiments data generated at a first game or a first series of games may be tested or audited to provide verification that the data is fair. In various embodiments a test may be performed to verify that the data conforms to some statistical distribution. The statistical distribution may be a distribution that is generally thought to govern in the one or more random processes used to generate the data. For example a set of data may include data about 10 000 outcomes generated at one of a group of roulette wheels each roulette wheel having 38 spaces. An applicable statistical distribution may predict that each possible outcome of the roulette wheel would occur approximately once every 38 outcomes or approximately 263 times out of the data set of 10 000 outcomes. Thus a test of the data about the 10 000 outcomes might test that each of the 38 possible outcomes of a roulette wheel occurred approximately 263 times out of the 10 000 outcomes. The tests may allow for some deviation. For example it may be considered acceptable for an outcome to occur from 213 to 313 times. However if an outcome occurs a number of times that is not between 213 and 313 then the data may be considered suspicious. Data may be required to pass one or more tests such as tests of statistical distribution before the data will be permitted to be used in a second game.

In various embodiments a single game may allow the participation of two or more secondary players. In various embodiments the single game may allow the participation of players across an entire casino. The single game may be prominently featured or publicized. For example the progress of the game may be shown on prominent display screens or monitors throughout a casino. The game may be played on an elevated stage or platform that is visible to many. In various embodiments the game may allow participation by secondary players in real time. For example a secondary player may place a bet on the game the game may occur and then the secondary player may be paid based on the outcome of the game and the bet of the secondary player. In various embodiments the game may be played by a primary player. In various embodiments the game may be played by a primary dealer and the house or a representative of the casino. For example the game may include a primary player and a dealer. In various embodiments the game may be generated electronically. The game may be a game played on a gaming device by a primary player. The game may be played entirely electronically.

In various embodiments a given secondary player may place a bet that the primary player will win. In various embodiments the secondary player may place a bet that the house will win. Among all secondary players placing bets on the game some may bet on the primary player and some may bet on the house. In various embodiments secondary players may bet on other events as well. For example secondary players may bet that particular cards will fall that a particular point total will be achieved that a particular roll of dice will occur and so. The featured game may be any suitable game such as blackjack craps baccarat roulette video poker or any other suitable game.

In various embodiments a game may allow the participation of a small group of players. For example a game may allow the participation of eight secondary players. The secondary players may all be players at one gaming table in one area of a casino in one restaurant or may all be grouped together in some other way. One of the group of players may play the featured game. The other players may then act as secondary players and participate in the featured game. In various embodiments the player who plays the feature game may rotate amongst the group of players.

In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on a particular events that will occur in a game. The secondary player may bet that a particular roll of the dice will occur or that the dealer will bust in a game of blackjack.

In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on particular cards that will occur in the featured game. For example a secondary player may bet that an ace of spades and a king of hearts will be dealt in the featured game. If the ace of spades and king of hearts do appear in the game the secondary player may win a significant multiple of his bet e.g. ten times his bet. The amount that a secondary player wins may be based on the probability with which the resolution of the events the player is betting on is likely to occur. For example if the secondary player bets on an event resolution with a small probability of occurrence the secondary player may stand to win relatively more. In various embodiments the amount that a secondary player stands to win may depend on the specificity with which he specifies the event resolutions of a featured game. For example a secondary player may stand to win more if he correctly specifies ranks and suits of a set of cards in a featured game than if he simply specifies ranks.

In various embodiments a secondary player may bet that a particular card will be dealt in the featured game. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on a particular combination of cards that will be dealt in the featured game. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on an order with which cards will be dealt. For example a secondary player may bet that an ace will be dealt first followed by a ten followed by a queen. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on cards that will occur in a player hand. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on cards that will occur in a dealer hand. In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on a first set of cards that will occur in a player hand and on a second set of cards that will occur in a dealer hand. For example a secondary player may bet that a player will receive a jack of diamonds and a nine of hearts and that a dealer will receive a seven of clubs two of hearts and queen of clubs.

In various embodiments a secondary player may specify each card that will be dealt in the featured game. The secondary player may win only if each specified card is dealt.

In various embodiments a secondary player may participate in his own game as a primary player. At the same time the secondary player may bet on the featured game as a secondary player. One or more events that occur in the secondary player s own game may serve to specify the secondary player s bet on the featured game. For example the secondary player may play a game of blackjack where he receives the ace of spades and the ten of hearts. By receiving such cards the secondary player may automatically be betting that the primary player in the featured game will also receive the ace of spades and the ten of hearts. Thus the secondary player s own hand may serve as a specification of a bet placed in a game played by a different player i.e. the primary player . A hand a set of cards a roll of the dice or any other event in which a secondary participates e.g. as a primary player may serve as an entry ticket or bet into another game e.g. into a featured game .

In various embodiments betting on a featured game may be pari mutuel. The house may take a percentage of all bets placed. The pool of bets may then be given to the player or players who have correctly specified the resolution an event in the featured game. For example the pool of all bets may go to the player who correctly specifies the most cards that are dealt in the featured game. For tied players the pool may be divided equally and or in proportion to the bets placed by the tied players.

In various embodiments betting on a featured game may be progressive. All or a portion of bets placed by secondary players may go into a pool. The pool may be won by any secondary player who correctly specifies the resolution of one or more events in the featured game. For example a secondary player may win the pool for correctly specifying each card that is dealt to the primary player and each card that is dealt to the dealer in a game of blackjack. If there is not a winner of the pool then the pool may carry over to the next game.

In various embodiments a secondary player may win a portion of the pool for correctly specifying the resolution of some events but not others or for being off by a small amount from correctly specifying event resolutions. For example if a secondary player correctly specifies all but one of the cards dealt in a game the secondary player may win 10 of all bets placed on the game. As another example if a secondary player correctly specifies all the suits of the cards dealt but not all the ranks then the secondary player may win 5 of the pool. As another example if the secondary player correctly specifies all but one card and specifies the correct rank but incorrect suit on the remaining card then the player may win 20 of the pool.

In various embodiments where there is a progressive pool a secondary player s own game e.g. a game in which the secondary player serves as a primary player may serve to determine the secondary player s entry into the featured game.

In various embodiments a bet made by a secondary player in a featured game may be made according to fixed odds. For example the secondary player may bet that certain events will transpire in the primary game and may receive a fixed payout based on those events. The secondary player may receive different levels of fixed payouts depending on how close the secondary player came to specifying the events that transpired in the featured game.

The featured game may be a game in which an ordinary casino patron is playing. A particular primary player may play the featured game for some number of games. Then another primary player may play in the featured game. In various embodiments a primary player need not make any special efforts to be in the featured game. Instead for example a cameraman may travel around a casino alternately filming different primary players involved in games. The game of the primary player currently being filmed may be the featured game.

In various embodiments the featured game may be presented on a mobile gaming device. For example a secondary player may watch the progress and the events of the featured game on his mobile gaming device. The secondary player may also place bets on the featured game using his mobile gaming device. In various embodiments the featured game may be presented on any device including on a gaming device. For example a secondary player may watch the featured game on a display screen of a slot machine. The secondary player may even place bets on the featured game using the slot machine interface.

In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on events within any particular game including betting on the outcome of any particular game. The secondary player need not be restricted to betting only on a prominently featured game. The secondary player may for example decide that he would like to bet on a particular primary player of blackjack who is currently playing at a blackjack table within a casino. The secondary player may then specify for example one or more cards that will be dealt in that game. If the secondary player is correct then the secondary player may win a payout.

In various embodiments a secondary player may bet on an event or events including an outcome within a plurality of games. The secondary player may thus stand to win any of the plurality of games has an event resolution that was correctly specified by the secondary player. For example the secondary player may bet that any player at a blackjack table will get two aces as his first two cards in the next game of blackjack. The secondary player may then win money if any of the players at the blackjack table does in fact get two aces as his first two cards in the next game of blackjack. In various embodiments the secondary player may win a payout that is based on the number of games in which his specified resolutions actually occurred. In the aforementioned example the secondary player may win a first amount if the event resolution he specified occurred in one game and may win a second amount if the event resolution he specified occurred in two games. The second amount may be greater than the first amount. The secondary player may win a special jackpot if the event resolution he specified occurred in all games. In various embodiments the payout received by a secondary player for specifying an event resolution in a plurality of games may depend on the number of games. If the event specified by the secondary player occurs in one of five games the secondary player may win more than if the event had occurred in one of 25 games.

In various embodiments a secondary player may specify one or more event resolutions or an outcome. The secondary player may specify for example a set of cards that may be dealt a set of numbers that may be rolled on dice a number that will arise in roulette and so on. The event resolutions specified by the secondary player may then apply in a plurality of featured games. For example the event resolutions may apply in a series of consecutive featured games.

As an example a secondary player may specify that a primary player in blackjack will receive the two of hearts ten of clubs and nine of diamonds. The secondary player may further specify that the dealer will receive an ace of spades and a king of spades. The secondary player may then win a prize if the specified cards are dealt to the specified parties i.e. player and dealer in any of the next 100 featured games of blackjack.

In various embodiments the secondary player may be required to make a bet for every featured game in which he participates as a secondary player e.g. for every game in which he is eligible to win a payout or jackpot . In various embodiments the secondary player may receive free entry as a secondary player into the featured game so long as the secondary player also is playing in his own game e.g. in the capacity of a primary player . Where the secondary player receives free entry a portion of his wager in the secondary player s own game may be used to fund the prize pool or payout in the featured game. For example 1 cent may come from every secondary player s bet in his her own game and contribute towards the prize pool of the featured game. The prize pool may build up as a progressive prize until it is won by one of the secondary players.

A secondary player may specify the outcome of event resolutions in various ways. In various embodiments the secondary player may himself choose particular resolutions. For example the secondary player may choose particular cards that he thinks will be dealt in the featured game. For example the secondary player may choose particular numbers that he thinks will be rolled in a featured craps game. In various embodiments the secondary player does not himself choose an event resolution or outcome. Rather an event resolution in the secondary player s own game e.g. a game in which the secondary player is serving as a primary player may determine what event resolution or outcome in the featured game wins for the secondary player. In various embodiments an event resolution or outcome in the featured game must match an event resolution or outcome in the secondary player s own game in order for the secondary player to win a payout or prize from the featured game. For example the secondary player may be playing a game of blackjack as a primary player . At the same time the secondary player may place a 1 bet on a featured game of blackjack. The secondary player may win a 10 000 payout if every card dealt in the featured game matches by rank and suit every card dealt in the game of the secondary player.

In various embodiments a secondary player describes the configuration of a game e.g. of a hand . The description by the secondary player may include a description of what the primary player will have and a description of what the dealer will have. Following the secondary player s description of a configuration there may be some period of time or some number of plays during which games are monitored. The games monitored may be featured games or any suitable games within a casino or even outside the casino. The secondary player may win if any of the monitored games then matches the description originally set forth by the secondary player. If the secondary player wins the secondary player may win a progressive prize.

In various embodiments when a player comes near a dealer the dealer may be told. In various embodiments when a player comes within a predetermined range of the dealer the dealer may be told. A predetermined range may be for example 5 feet 10 feet 20 feet or any other predetermined range. In various embodiments a dealer may be told of a player s proximity in various ways. A screen at the dealer s table may display a message for the dealer indicating that the player is near. In various embodiments a dealer may wear headphones which receive an electronic e.g. wireless audio feed from a casino server or from a casino employee. When a player arrives near the dealer the dealer may be told via a voice in his headphones. For example a voice message may say to the dealer John Smith has just arrived to your right. He is a 65 year old male. Say hi to him. In various embodiments the player s presence near the dealer may be detected in various ways. The player may be carrying a mobile device for example.

When a player is near to a dealer the dealer may take various actions. The dealer may greet the player such as by name. The dealer may ask the player whether the player would like to join the table for a game. The dealer may ask the player whether he would like to link to the table using his mobile device. The player would then for example be able to participate in a game at the table as a secondary player or to play as a primary player without sitting down. The dealer may offer the player a special incentive to play. For example the dealer may offer two extra comp points per dollar wagered for the first hour if the player sits down. The dealer may mention other events in the player s life. For example the dealer may congratulate the player on a large payout he received recently on a recent birthday on a recent move to another state or on anything else about which the dealer or the casino may have information. A dealer may be trained to interact with a player in a particular way e.g. to greet the player by name . In various embodiments a dealer may be prompted in real time or near real time as to what to day to a player. For example a message may appear on a screen at the dealer s table telling the dealer to congratulate the player on getting married recently. In various embodiments a dealer may be provided with general information about a player. It may then be left to the dealer to improvise a greeting or other conversation with the player.

In various embodiments a game table gaming device or other object may be programmed or configured to greet a player or otherwise interact with a player as the player walks by. For example when a player comes within ten feet of a gaming table a voice may be broadcast from a speaker on the gaming table. The voice may say won t you come sit and play for a while Mr. Smith A gaming table or other object may say various things to a player including referring to a recent event in the player s life or saying anything else.

In various embodiments a casino employee may speak to a player via a gaming table or gaming device. A player may come within a predetermined distance of a gaming table. The gaming table may detect the presence of the player. The gaming table may then alert a remote casino representative. The remote casino representative may be sitting at a computer terminal which may be in communication with the casino server. The computer terminal may display information about the player to the casino representative. The casino representative may then begin speaking to the player using a microphone. The casino representative s voice may then be transmitted over a network e.g. over a casino network or over the Internet to the gaming table. The casino representative s voice may then be broadcast from a speaker at the gaming table. The gaming table may also capture voice or video from the player e.g. using microphones or cameras and transmit this back to the casino representative. In this way the casino representative may have a conversation with the player. To the player it may appear as if the table is talking to him.

In various embodiments a player may bet on events that will occur in the future. In various embodiments a player may bet on events that will be resolved in the future. In various embodiments a player may bet on a sequence of events that will begin at a first time in the future and will end at a second later time in the future. In various embodiments player may bet on a sequence of events that will begin presently and will end in the future. In various embodiments a player may bet on a sequence of events that have begun in the past but which will resolve in the future. Various embodiments described herein may pertain to bets on events that will occur in the future including sequences of events that will both begin and end in the future.

In various embodiments a player may bet on the number of red outcomes that will occur at a given roulette wheel over a particular 24 hour period beginning one week in the future. The player may for example place a bet by giving money or casino chips to a casino employee. The player may provide parameters of his bet. For example the player may specify the beginning and ending times in between which his bet is applicable. The player may specify what events he is betting on. For example the player may specify that he is betting that red outcomes will exceed black outcomes between the beginning and ending times of the bet. After the ending time e.g. one week in the future the casino may determine whether the player has won his bet or not. For example the casino may check records of which roulette outcomes have actually occurred between the beginning and ending times specified by the player. The casino may thereby determine for example whether more red outcomes have occurred than black outcomes between the beginning and ending time periods. If the player has won the bet then the casino may pay the player based on a predetermined pay schedule based on the a priori odds of the player winning the bet based on the bet amount and or based on any other factor.

In various embodiments a player may provide details of his bet via a betting terminal. The player may navigate a series of menus for example to select or specify parameters of his bet. For example one menu may allow a player to select a game. Another menu may allow the player to select a time period in the future during which the player s bet will apply. Another menu may allow the player to select the particular aspects of the game on which the player is betting. For example a player may bet that a particular outcome of the game will occur so many times during a chosen time period. As another example a player may bet that a primary player e.g. as opposed to the house will win some percentage of the time during the chosen time period.

In various embodiments once the period over which the bet applies has ended the player may claim a payout if a payout is due. For example suppose that the player has won 100. The player may then visit a cage or desk at a casino provide evidence of his identity e.g. a license e.g. a fingerprint e.g. a birth certificate e.g. a social security card e.g. a passport and collect his payout.

In some embodiments a player who has placed a bet on one or more events that will resolve in the future may receive documentation of the bet. For example the player may receive a receipt or ticket that includes details of the bet. The document may include a bet amount a time period over which the bet is applicable a payout table and or any other details of the bet. In some embodiments the document may include an identifier such as an alphanumeric character sequence or a bar code. The identifier may allow a casino attendant or casino server to match the identifier to a record of the bet stored in a database. For example the casino may use the identifier to look up stored details about the bet.

In various embodiments a casino may store a record of a bet made by the player. The record of the bet may be tied to a player identifier such as to a player tracking card number. The player may then need only present the identifier such as his player tracking card in order to receive his appropriate payout from the bet.

In various embodiments a player may claim a payout or other prize stemming from a bet at a betting terminal. For example a player may insert his player tracking card number into a betting terminal. The terminal may determine based on the tracking card number whether there are any outstanding payouts owed to a player. If there are the betting terminal may provide payment to the player. In some embodiments the betting terminal may perform a security check to make sure that the person who has inserted the player tracking card is in fact the owner of the tracking card. Thus for example the betting terminal may ask the person to answer a secret question to recall details of the bet or to provide any other verification of his identity.

In various embodiments a slot machine or other gaming device may provide payment to a player based on a bet the player had previously made pertaining to future events e.g. events which have since transpired . For example the player may insert his player tracking card into the slot machine. The slot machine may determine the player s identity and may then credit the player with the appropriate payout.

In various embodiments a player s bet on a sequence of events may be tracked or monitored as the sequence of events unfolds. For example on Sep. 17 2012 a player may bet that at least 1000 blackjacks or naturals will occur at all blackjack tables in a casino during Sep. 24 2012. On Sep. 24 2012 the player may be able to begin tracking statistics relevant to his bet. In this case for example the player may be able to track how many blackjacks have occurred at all blackjack tables at the casino since the beginning of the day. For example the player may watch a constantly updating statistic showing that 610 . . . 611 . . . 612 . . . blackjacks have occurred thus far in the day. Following the statistic may be exciting for the player as the player hopes for the statistic to reach the point where he will have won his bet prior to the end of the day.

In various embodiments a player may be able to track the progress of his bet in various ways. For example a player may log onto the Internet provide identifying information e.g. a player tracking card number and may then be shown statistics relevant to bets that he has in progress. In another example a player at a casino hotel may be able to view the progress of his outstanding bets on casino television. In various embodiments a player may be able to visit any betting terminal provide identifying information and view a statistic related to his bet. In various embodiments a player may be able to visit a slot machine or other gaming device to view statistics related to his bet. A player may be able to call a particular phone number to view statistics related to his bet. In some embodiments monitors or sign boards located within a casino may show common statistics that may be of interest to a players.

In various embodiments a player may make a bet whose payout varies in a linear fashion or in an affine fashion with the value of a statistic. For example the player may receive one unit of payout e.g. one dollar per one unit value of the statistic. Thus for example a player may bet on the number of times that the outcome 00 will occur at a casino in a one day period. The player may be paid one dollar for every time over 50 that the outcome 00 occurs during that one day period. For example should the outcome 00 occur 60 times during the one day period the player may receive 10.

In various embodiments a player may lose money in a linear fashion or in an affine fashion with the value of a statistic. For example a player may owe one unit of currency per unit by which a statistic is less than a reference value. For example a player may owe one dollar for every time less than 50 that the outcome 00 occurs during a day. For example if the outcome 00 occurs only 45 times in a day then the player may owe the casino 5.

In various embodiments a player may win or lose money based on a non linear function of a statistic. For example a player may win money in proportion to the square of the amount by which a statistic exceeds a reference value e.g. the player wins 1 if 00 occurs 51 times 4 if 00 occurs 52 times 9 if 00 occurs 53 times and so on .

In various embodiments a bet that a player has made based on a sequence of events may be partially paid or resolved based on a partial sequence of events that have occurred already. The partial payment may represent an amount that the player or casino is now certain to win. For example if the player is to receive 1 for every time over 1000 that the house busts in blackjack during a given 12 hour period and the house has already busted 1010 times then the player may be guaranteed to receive at least 10. Therefore the player may be paid 10 even before the 12 hour period has ended. The player may receive additional payments later if the house busts additional times during the 12 hour period.

In some embodiments a partial payment may represent an expected amount that a player or casino will receive at the end of the period over which the bet applies. For example halfway through a period over which a bet applies standard probabilistic models may predict that a casino would expect to win 40 from a player based on events that have already transpired during the first half of a betting period. Thus the casino may collect 40 from the player. Should events during the second half of the betting period go in the player s favor the casino may pay back money to the player perhaps even paying the player more than the 40. However should events go against the player during the second half of the betting period the player may owe further money to the casino by the end of the betting period. In various embodiments partial payments may reduce a risk borne by a casino that a player will not pay what he owes. For example if a player accumulates a large debt to a casino the casino may run the risk that the player will disappear without paying the debt. Thus in various embodiments the casino may collect smaller payments from the player so as to reduce the possibility that the player will ever amass a large debt to the casino.

In various embodiments a player may wish to be released from the obligations of a bet prior to the end of the time period during which the relevant events will resolve. For example a player may have placed a bet on the number of times a jackpot will occur during the entire month of October. For example the player may bet 100 that at least 40 jackpots will be won throughout a casino in the month of October. However on October 15 the player may decide that he no longer wishes to wait until the end of October. Accordingly the player may ask the casino to pay him some amount based on the number of jackpots that have been won thus far in the month of October. The payment provided by the casino may be relatively greater if it appears fairly likely that the player will win e.g. if 35 jackpots have already been won in just the first half of the month and may be relatively less if it appears fairly likely that the player will not win e.g. if 5 jackpots have already been won in just the first half of the month . The amount of the payment may be based on a probabilistic model which may be used to determine an expected amount the player is likely to win. For example if the player has bet 100 and stands to either win 200 or win 0 and if it is deemed that there is a 40 chance the player will win then the player may be paid 80 representing his expected winnings from the bet.

In various embodiments a player may express a desire to terminate a bet or to be released from a bet. The casino may determine an amount the player may receive for certain in lieu of continuing to wait for the bet to be resolved. The player may then decide whether he is willing to accept the amount determined by the casino or not. If so the player may indicate his acceptance. The player may then receive an immediate payment and the bet may thereby terminate.

As some examples a first player may bet on one or more of the following during a period of time e.g. a period of time beginning and ending in the future e.g. a period of time beginning in the present and ending in the future e.g. a period of time that began in the past and will end in the future e.g. a period of time that began in the past and ended in the past e.g. a period of time that began in the past and ends in the present a the number 12 will occur at a particular roulette wheel 100 times b the number 4 will occur at any roulette wheel at a casino a total of 1000 times c the number of times that an even number will occur at a particular roulette wheel e.g. the player may be paid more the more that an even number occurs d the number of times that a bet on the banker will win in a game of baccarat e the number of times that a bet on a player will win in a game of baccarat f the most aces that are dealt to one player in a game of blackjack g the largest number of consecutive sevens that will be rolled at a particular craps table h the number of times any player will bust in a game of blackjack across a casino i the amount by which red outcomes will exceed black outcomes across a casino in a game of roulette e.g. if there are 1200 red outcomes and 1100 black outcomes then red outcomes have exceed black outcomes by 100 j the largest number of consecutive games at a slot machine that any player will win k the most bonus rounds that will be achieved by an individual slot machine and any other result of a sequence of events and any other statistic describing a sequence of events and any other value of a statistic describing a sequence of events.

In various embodiments a player may place a first bet on a series of games outcomes or other events that will end at some future time. For example the player may place a bet that the number of red outcomes will exceed the number of black outcomes over the next 10 hour period across all roulette games in a casino. As another example a player may bet on the number of royal flushes that will be dealt across the casino over the next 4 hour period. The player may stand to win 100 for every royal flush over 12 that is dealt.

At some point after having placed a bet but before the time period covered by the bet has ended the player may become worried about the final outcome of his bet. For example the player may expect to win money e.g. red outcomes may currently exceed black outcomes but may worry that the tides will turn against him e.g. there will by a string of predominantly black outcomes . In some embodiments a player may have a bet that covers a period going ten hours into the future. However the player may wish to know what his payout will be by the time only six hours have passed without any uncertainty in the last four hours of the period. Thus in various embodiments the player may have the opportunity to guard against possible negative turns of events during a period on which he has bet. In various embodiments a player may have the opportunity to guard against uncertainty stemming from a bet.

In some embodiments a player makes a first bet. The bet pays 10 for every single red outcome that occurs in excess of the black outcomes at roulette tables across the casino in the next 10 hours. For example the bet will pay 100 if there are 550 red outcomes and 540 black outcomes. The player will also lose 10 for every single black outcome that occurs in excess of red outcomes. Thus for example the player may lose 80 if there are 532 red outcomes and 540 black outcomes. Thus the player s bet may function like a spread bet. The player then makes a second bet that can cancel out or hedge a portion of the first bet. For example the player may make a second bet that during the second half of the 10 hour period i.e. the latter five hours of the period black outcomes will exceed red outcomes. The player may in this second bet stand to win 10 for every black outcome that occurs in excess of a red outcome but may stand to lose 10 for every red outcome in excess of black outcomes.

To illustrate the effects of the second bet suppose after the first five hours of the period of the first bet there have been 220 red outcomes and 200 black outcomes. Red outcomes thus exceed black outcomes by 20 and if this state of affairs were to hold for the remainder of the period i.e. for the next five hours then the player would win 200. However the player may worry that black outcomes will begin to predominate. The player may wish to lock in his 200. The second bet described above may alleviate the player s concern. Suppose in the second half of the period of the first bet which corresponds to the entire period of the second bet that black outcomes outnumber red outcomes by 50. The player will then owe 300 for the first bet. However the player will win 500 for his second bet. Thus the player will still be ahead by 200 the same amount that he was ahead after the first half of the period covered by the first bet. Suppose as an alternative scenario in the second half of the period of the first bet red outcomes outnumber black outcomes by 50. Then from the first bet the player will win 700 but from the second bet the player will lose 500. The player will still be ahead by 200. It can therefore be seen that the second bet has effectively hedged the second half of the period of the first bet so as to lock in what the player has won or lost after the first half of the period covered by the first bet. The hedging mechanism may server to shorten the life of a bet to alleviate worry or uncertainty to lock in a gain to guard against further loss or any other function.

In some embodiments a second bet may not be a perfect offset or hedge against a first bet. Rather the second bet may offset some component or risk inherent within the first bet. For example a player may make a first bet on the number of royal flush hands that will occur across a casino. The player may stand to win 10 for every royal flush that is achieved in excess of 20 in the next 5 hour period. However the player may owe 10 for every unit by which the number of royal flushes falls short of 20. The player may be comfortable with his chances as long as there are plenty of people playing video poker. However the player may worry that if few people play video poker it will be almost impossible for him to win the bet. Therefore the player may make another bet that depends on the number of people who will play video poker across a casino. The player may make a bet that defines a person playing as anyone who begins a gaming session and plays at least 10 games of video poker. The player may stand to win 1 for every person less than 1000 who plays. The player may stand to lose 1 for every person more than 1000 who plays. Thus if there are few players the player is less likely to win his bet on the number of royal flushes. However the player will win his bet on the number of players. Thus the player has hedged out the risk of there being too few players to bring a large number of royal flushes. The player s main desire is to gamble that games which are played will result in royal flushes.

In another example a player places a bet on the number of times a dealer will bust in any game of blackjack across a casino. Aside from the inherent uncertainties in the card ordering which will influence the result of the player s bet there are other uncertainties that may influence the player s bet. One uncertainty is the number of players who will play blackjack. For example if very few players play there will just be fewer games in general and thus the dealer will tend to bust less. Another uncertainty is the speed of play. Some dealers may tend to keep the games going fast and so may tend to play a large number of games and may thereby bust more often. However other dealers may proceed more slowly and may therefore tend to bust less often. Another uncertainty is the strategy that players use. If players tend to hit a lot then the players themselves may bust frequently. Once all players in a game have busted the dealer need not deal himself cards and so the dealer need not bust. Each of these uncertainties may impact the outcome of the player s bet. Therefore in various embodiments the player may place bets which hedge out these various risk factors in his original bet. For example the player may make a bet that depends only on the number of times that players hit. In this way a player may better isolate the particular risk or uncertainty on which he would like to bet.

In various embodiments a player may place bets on one or more of the following a the number of players that will play a particular type of game b the average number of games of a particular type of game that will be played by players playing that type of game c the number of gaming devices that will be used d the number of players playing max coins at a slot machine e.g. the number of players eligible to win the jackpot e the strategy or strategies that will be used by a player f the total number of a particular type of game that will be played e.g. across a casino in a given period of time g the rate of play of a game e.g. the number of blackjack hands that will be dealt per hour h the average amount that players will bet in a game i the number of a particular outcome that will occur during a particular time period in the future j the number by which the frequency of one outcome will exceed the frequency of another outcome at some time in the future or on any other event or sequence of events. The bets made by a player may server to hedge reduce alleviate insure against or otherwise mitigate risks or uncertainties associated with other bets of the player. Docking an Mp3 Player at a Gaming Device

In various embodiments a player may dock a music player into a device such as a gaming device slot machine video poker machine or betting terminal. The music player may include an Apple iPod a Sandisk Sansa or any other MP3 player. The music player may be connected to the device via one or more electrical wires or cables via an electrical connector or via any other connection. The music player may be wirelessly connected to the gaming device. Music from the music player may then be played through speakers of the gaming device.

In various embodiments a player may configure his music player and or the device to play certain music at certain times. For example the player may configure his music player to play a first song when the player wins and to play a second song when the player loses. Various snippets of the songs may be played at once. For example a first ten seconds of a first song may be played when a player wins. A second ten seconds of the first song may be played when the player wins again. In between if the player loses a first ten seconds of a second song may be played.

In some embodiments the player may configure his music player with which songs will be played under which circumstances. For example the player may designate a winning song a losing song a jackpot song a song that will be played while the reels are spinning a song that will be played while the player is deciding on a strategy and so on. The player may designate such songs beforehand using software downloaded from a casino e.g. from the casino to which the player will pay a visit from the manufacturer of the music player e.g. from Apple if the music player is an iPod or from any other source.

In some embodiments one or more surface computing device such as a Microsoft Surface a tablet computing device such as an ipad and so on may be used to perform one or more actions and or display information. For example in one embodiment a surface computing device may be used to display events in a game e.g. a live game a virtual game a game playable by a community of people and so on . In some embodiments multiple such devices may be used in a single game to display copies of the game to display distinct elements of the game and so on. A surface computing device may include a computing device designed to appear similar to a surface such as a table.

In some embodiments elements of a card game may be displayed on one or more such devices. Such a card game ma be played remotely e.g. by a primary player at a table and or may be a virtual game not played by any other player. Players may make bets on such a card game e.g. using a mobile gaming device. Outcomes of games may be displayed on a video display e.g. and led tv . In some embodiments a game of baccarat may be played in such a manner with elements of the game displayed on a surface computing device and or other display e.g. card plays in a live game . Players using mobile gaming devices may place bets on a player hand and or a dealer hand for the game being displayed on the surface computing device and or display screen.

In some embodiments a roulette game may be played using such a surface computing device. For example a multi reel roulette game may be played. In some embodiments a first surface computing device may display information regarding a first roulette wheel e.g. an image of the wheel spinning an outcome of the wheel statistics about the wheel and so on . The wheel may be a video of a real wheel a virtual wheel and so on. In some embodiments a second surface computing device may display information about a second roulette wheel. In some embodiments any number e.g. 5 separate surface computing devices may display information about such a number of roulette wheels. In such a manner a surface computing device may be placed as desired to provide the functionality of a roulette wheel at a roulette table.

In some embodiments one or more players may make wagers on the outcomes of one or more spins of one or more roulette wheels displayed using one or more surface computing devices. For example such a wager may include a wager on a next spin of a next wheel to stop a wager on a pattern over a series of next spins a wager on an ordered series of results of the next X number of results a wager that a number will appear some number of time in some number of spins a wager on a result of a particular wheel a wager on an aggregate of data over the course of a plurality of spins of one or more of the wheels a wager on a pattern of colors a wager on a count of colors over a time period a wager on outcomes over a time period and so on

In some embodiments a roulette wheel may be spun in response to a wager being placed on the roulette wheel. In some embodiments roulette wheels may be spun and or stopped periodically. For example a roulette wheel of the plurality of roulette wheels may be stopped once every minute. In some embodiments roulette wheels may be spun and or stopped continually periodically as desired in response to bets on a schedule and so on.

An outcome of one or more of the roulette wheel spins may be used to determine an outcome of one or more of the placed wagers. In some embodiments previously played and or currently played games may be used to determine outcomes of spins. In some embodiments newly created random numbers from a random number generator may be used to determine outcomes of spins. In some embodiments aggregated information and or historic information about past outcomes may be displayed to a user e.g. on a mobile gaming device on a surface computing device on a display device and so on .

Some embodiments may include a game based on the outcome of multiple games. For example some embodiments may include a game based on the outcome of a plurality of roulette spins e.g. five reel roulette . illustrates an interface that may be used to place bets in such a multi reel roulette game view results from such a game and so on.

Some embodiments may include receiving an indication of a wager on a multi game game. For example a player may access such an interface through a mobile device to place wagers using money in an account by operating one or more controls e.g. dragging a chip to a number color wagering area and so on . A wager in such a game may include for example a wager that an outcome will occur in at least one of the multiple games a certain number of times in a particular spot in the games that a pattern will occur in the games that the games will result in some characteristic of outcomes and so on.

Some embodiments may include determining outcomes of the multiple games and based on those outcomes determining an outcome of the game and or wagers by a player. For example a player may place a wager that identifies some characteristic of the multiple roulette spins and if they occur the player may receive a payout. A player may place a wager on a single reel of the multiple reels all of the multiple reels and or some of the multiple reels. Based on the outcome s of those reels a wager result may be determined.

It should be recognized that although roulette is given as an example that other embodiments may include other games in any combination e.g. craps games craps and roulette and poker in a mix of games and so on . It should be recognized that any wagers on any characteristics may be made on outcomes of any number of games that make up a multi game game e.g. a player will win multiple players will win a player will win in all games a player will lose more than x dollars a red outcome will occur a number will come up a card will come up a symbol will come up some number of a value or suit will come up some number of red cards or numbers in a mix of cards and roulette will occur and so on .

Some embodiments may include a jackpot bet if a player wins a wager with certain characteristics. For example a player may win a bonus wager if the player correctly identifies all game outcomes of a multi game game. For example a player may be that an exact sequence of events will occur. The sequence may be the same in all of the multi reels of to multi reel roulette game. The result may be ordered or unordered as desired by a gaming provider. In some embodiments a player may receive a reward based on the results of the multiple games based on how close to correct the player s wager is e.g. all correct wins a jackpot some correct wins less none correct loses . It should be recognized that the amount needed to be correct to win anything may be altered to determine house edge as desired.

Some embodiments may include a bonus bet that is based on cards or other rules that may differ in some manner from sub games of a multi game game. For example such a bonus bet may pay in response to a roulette game resulting in a flush a pair a full house a straight 3 of a kind 4 of a kind five of a kind and so on that may be typical card game results. In some embodiments a bonus bet may allow a player to select one or more option e.g. one or more events that will occur . As the result increase in rank the payout may increase in rank. In some embodiments a player may pick a preferred number or set or sequence of number. If that number comes up or sequence comes up then the player may win more. For example a highest jackpot may be played if five of a kind of the players chosen number occurs.

It should be recognized that sub games in a multi game game may take any form. For example sub games may include actual games in a casino. Information about those games may be received by a gaming service e.g. camera footage results and used as input for amulet game game. Sub games may include past games future games live games and so on. Sub games may include virtual games e.g. a game that doesn t exist such as a game created by a computer generated random number generation . Sub games may include video games e.g. games displayed through a video display such as a video reel on a surface computing device . A reel may include a reel in a casino a virtual reel for a specific player a virtual reel for any players of a gaming service a video reel on a set of surface computing devices and so on. It should be recognized that other games may similarly take any form virtual video for a group individual and so on. Input from any type of game may be received and converted into useful information for a multi game game e.g. displayed in video form in an interface on a mobile device used to determine results of a wager and so on .

Some embodiments may include wagering that one or more occurrences will happen with some relationship to one or more occurrences in some number of games. For example in the context of roulette a wager may include a wager that more reds than blacks will occur in one or more games.

A game may include a single game game and or a multi game game. For example a player may wager that more reds than blacks will occur in five single game games of roulette. Based on the number of reds and blacks in those five spins of roulette an outcome of the wager may be determined. As another example a player may wager that more reds than blacks will occur in five mulit game games of roulette. The multi game games may include five game games. In some embodiments an outcome may be determined by comparing a total reds and blacks in each game in the multiple multi game games. For example the twenty five spins in the five five game roulette games may be summed and a determination of the number of reds and blacks in those twenty five spins may be made. In some embodiments an outcome may be determined based on the outcomes of the multigame games separately. For example a determination may be made to whether more reds than blacks occurred in each of the five five reel roulette games e.g. more reds in the first five games more reds in the second five games more blacks in the third five games more blacks in the fourth five games and more reds in the fifth five games . The actual sum of the reds and black may be irrelevant to the outcome of a wager but the number of games may be the deciding factor. For example in the above example of five five reel roulette games reds may be blacks because more of the multi game games had more reds than blacks e.g. 3 vs 2 . This may be the case even if a total amount of blacks is greater than reds within the sub games of the multi game games e.g. game 1 has 3 reds and 2 blacks game has 3 reds and 2 blacks game 3 has 5 blacks game 4 has 5 blacks game 5 has 3 reds and 2 blacks . It should be recognized that various embodiments may take any desired single or multi game game methodology and or any outcome determination methodology based on games or counts as desired.

It should be recognized that while roulette and reds vs black are discussed as non limiting examples only. For example various embodiments may include odds vs evens in roulette flush vs straight in poker bust vs non bust in blackjack over 100 points vs under 100 points in basketball any casino game any sporting event any event and so on. It should be recognized that while reds and blacks examples may include event of roughly even chances of each side occurring and so there may include no spread and or roughly even odds although in some embodiments there may be a spread for a red black roulette bet and or disparate odds that some embodiments may include wagering options that do not include roughly even odds e.g. 2s vs 7s in craps and may include a spread and or odds differentials. Some embodiments may include determining a spread or odds based on expected events to maintain a desired house edge and presenting that information through a wagering interface for a player to place a wager.

Some embodiments may include receiving a wager based on a comparison of occurrences in one or more games. illustrates an example interface that may be used by a player to enter such a wager and or view information about such a wager through a mobile device. For example a player may use the interface of to select a number of games e.g. single reel and or multi reel roulette games on which a wager is based and whether reds or blacks will win over that number of games.

Some embodiments may include determining the outcomes of the games that the wager is based on. Information about the games may be displayed through interface e.g. video representations of games may be displayed outcomes of individual games may be displayed etc. . Based on the outcomes of the games an outcome of a wager may be determined and payouts may be made for winning wagers e.g. adjusting balances of a player account .

As discussed above the game may include any forms of games e.g. live past virtual video group individual etc. . In some embodiments all players of a gaming service may wager based on a same set of games. For example the next set of games happening in a casino a set of games being run on a set of surface computing devices a set of games generated from a common random number generator and so on.

In some embodiments players may places wagers at any time and be assigned into a game based on when a wager is placed. For example if player one places a wager in a five reel game at time A before reel 1 has been spun the player may have his wager resolved starting with reel 1 i.e. the next reel to be spun and the subsequent four reels as well. Player 2 may place a wager in a five reel game at time B after reel 1 has been spun but before reel 2 one of the subsequent four and may have his wager resolved based on reel 2 and one or more other reels not used to resolve player 1 s wager. Accordingly some embodiment may include determining a set of games to be used to resolve a wager based on the timing of a wager and timing of the games.

In some embodiments games may include a group starting game. For example games may include five reel roulette games and some game of the set of five may be identified as a first game. Players that wager before the first game may be assigned to that set of games for the five reel game or any set of five reel games upcoming such as if the player selected 5 games of five reel roulette . Players that place wagers after that first game may be assigned to a next set of five e.g. the next set that begins with that first roulette reel spinning again . illustrates that some embodiments may include providing a timer that indicates time left to wager before a next set of roulette reel spins begins and after which a user would have to wait for his game to begin until a subsequent set. Some embodiments may include determining such time based on when a desired next game is to begin and controlling roulette reels to spin based on that timing e.g. a game may begin by starting a first video roulette reel in a set of five video roulette reels spinning every twenty minutes . Some embodiments may include controlling the roulette reel to stop or begin a stopping process rather then begin a spinning process as part of a start of a game at a desired time.

In some embodiments if multiple games are selected for a wager e.g. 20 then the first game determined may be the first in that set of multiple games. Accordingly various players may have different wagers outstanding that may resolve on some same and some different games.

Based on the outcomes of games and wagers an amount of money in an account may be adjusted for wins an amount of a wager may be adjusted down for the placement of a wager.

Some embodiments may include allowing a player to place single game wagers in a broader multi gam comparison setting. illustrates an example interface that may be used in some embodiments to facilitate such single game wagering e.g. in the context of a 5 reel roulette game . For example a player may place a bet on a comparison in a set of multiple games e.g. as discussed above in a 5 10 20 30 40 50 100 and so on games context . A player may wager on a particular outcome happening in the single game e.g. a number of greens at least a number of greens an exact number of greens a number of reds an exact number of reds and blacks and so on a player may wager on a comparison happening in the single game e.g. more reds than blacks in a single 5 reel roulette game and so on. A determination may be made of the outcome of the game and the wager may be resolved based on that outcome.

Such Quick spin wagering may allow a player that is waiting for a broader wager that takes on more games to continue to wager on quicker games while waiting for the result. Though a player may not be required to place such a broader wager to make such a quick spin wager.

Some embodiments may include determining the game that is wagered upon based on a time of the wager. Examples of this are described above. For example a game on which the wager is placed may be a next game. Some embodiments may allow a player to select a game e.g. game 5 of 20 games on which the broader wager is based .

Some embodiments may include a parlay style wager. Such a wager may include a parlay of a comparison game. Such a wager may include a parlay of a comparison game that is based on multi game games. illustrates an example interface that may be used to place a parlay wager that is based on a comparison game that is based on five reel roulette.

As an example a player may select a number of parlays by operating a control. A parlay may include a number of successive wins that may be required to win e.g. pressing a 3 4 5 6 parlay option . A player may select a number of underlying games over which a comparison game is played within each parlay by operating a control e.g. pressing a 1 5 10 20 game option . A player may select a winning outcome for each parlay by operating a winning outcome selector control e.g. pressing a red or black outcome for each parlay . An interface may be adjusted so that a number of outcome selectors may correspond to the number of chosen parlays. The parlays selector may be in order of the parlays occurring from left to right.

As an example a player may choose to play 4 parlays each being based on 10 respective games. Each game may include a respective 5 reel roulette game based on the spinning of five roulette reels. A player may select that in parlay 1 the first set of ten 5 reel roulette games reds will win in parlay 2 the second set of ten 5 reel roulette games reds will win in parlay 3 the third set of ten 5 reel roulette games reds will win in parlay 4 the fourth set of ten 5 reel roulette games blacks will win. Based on the outcomes of the games the outcomes of the wager may be determined. A player may be required to win each leg of the parlay to win the parlay wager.

Some embodiments may include a selection of a number of parlays a number of games in each parlay and a comparison between two possible events in each respective parlay e.g. reds will be in greater number than blacks . A parlay wager may be placed in response to such selection in response to a selection of an amount of money in response to a submission or receipt of sufficient information to identify the parlay wager and so on.

Some embodiments may include determining results of games that the parlay wager is based on. For example that may include a series of games equal in number to the number of games per parlay multiplied by the number of parlays. Those games may be a series of game in a broader sequence of ongoing games e.g. five reel roulette games may be on going throughout a day and the series may be some part of those ongoing games . For example the game may be the next set of games after a game is placed so that the first game in a broader set of games that occurs in full or in part after a wager is placed is the first game in a series of games used to resolve the wager. This may apply to any multi game and or comparison style wagering examples.

The same ongoing games may and or series of game may be common to multiple players and or wagers. For example a second player may place a parlay wager and at least some of the same series of games used to determine the outcome of a first player s wager may be used for the second player s wager. A subset of the series may be used if the number of second parlay sand second games is less than the first number and first games. A subset may be used if the second wager is received later than the first wager. The same games may be used if the wagers are received near each other in time e.g. so that the next game in an ongoing sequence is the same for both when the first ager and the second wager is placed and the number of parlays times games in parlays is the same. Some games may be the same and some may be different based on the times of wagers and the number of games needed.

For each parlay a determination may be made as to whether a selected comparison is true or not. A parlay wager outcome may be determined based on all such determinations.

Some embodiments may allow a player to place an inrunning style wager for a game or a set of games. illustrates an example interface through which a user may place such a wager. For example during a set of games e.g. a set of 60 five reel roulette games on which the player has placed some other wager the player may make a bet relative to the remaining games in the set including or excluding results in prior games in the set .

For example in some embodiments a player may make a wager on a sixty game set to have more blacks than reds and or some other statistical comparison. The player may select an inrunning or prop bet option to bring up an interface such as the one in that may be populated with information relative to the prior placed bet and or otherwise allow the user to select which prior selected set of games is of concern. The outcomes of some of the set may have been determined and shown to the player. The player may place a wager on the remaining set including or excluding the already determined outcomes e.g. that the total number of reds will exceed blacks by some amount using the known information about the completed portion of the set.

In some embodiments the set of games on which the player may wager may be unrelated to another wager placed by the player. For example when the player enters the prop bet or inrunning bet interface and selects to begin a set e.g. by selecting a et size such as 5 10 20 60 etc. a set may begin being determined for the player. Accordingly each player may have a different set of relevant games for a prop or in running bet even though they may be using the same games to make comparison style wagers. As the set progresses the player may view outcomes and place wagers on the overall comparison of the total set.

Some embodiments may include determining odds for an in running and or prop wager based on events in a set of games that such a wager may be placed on. For example as a chosen set progresses reds may begin to outnumber blacks. So offered wagers for reds to outnumber blacks may be given at worse odds for the player because from that current state the chances are greater for reds to outnumber blacks. One a wager is placed odds may be locked in at whatever odds were offered at a then current state. Odds for future wager may be adjusted as the game state changes to maintain a house edge. A player may wager that a comparison will be even that some element will outnumber some element be a certain threshold by more than the threshold by a certain number and so on. Wagers may be resolved at the end of a set by comparing the actual outcomes of the total set or portion of the set remaining when the wager is placed depending on the implementation to the wagered on outcome. A display of information may be adjusted as results of games are determined to display wagering options that include updated odds and or current states of a number of games in a set of games and the results so far or a statistic related to the results so far that may be wagered upon.

A device may include a mobile device a stationary device a kiosk and so on. For example such a device may include a cell phone executing a cell phone application that performs a desired method in communication with a gaming server and or presents an interface and or information to a user.

A server may include one or more computing devices that may communicate with a device to facilitate gaming services. A server may include any number of servers processors and so on operating together and or independently as desired. A sever may execute a method as desired to facilitate gaming functionality as desired.

It should be recognized that is given as a non limiting example only and that other embodiments may include any components such as memory processors computing devices communication networks random number generators blades interfaces controls and so on in any combination operating together and or independently to provide functionality such as that described herein in any combination whether described that way or not.

for each second consecutive and mutually exclusive set of the second number of games in the series of games up to the second number of parlays determining whether a second selected respective comparison is true in which each second consecutive and mutually exclusive set defines a respective parlay of the second number of parlays and the second selected respective comparison includes the second selected respective comparison for the respective parlay and

determining whether the second player wins the second parlay wager based on whether each second selected respective comparison is true for every respective parlay of the second number of parlays.

In response to determining the result for each game of the number of games updating by the computing device a display of information about the number of game in which the display of information includes a statistics about results that have been determined so far for the number of games and wagering options related to the number of games in which the wagering options include wagers on statistics for the entire number of games and odds for such wagers 

after determining results for a first set of the number of games less than all of the number of games receiving by the computing device a wager that the number of games will have a statistical characteristic in which the wager is defined by odds based on how the results for the first set of number of games affect the changes that the number of games will have the statistical characteristic 

after determining the results for the number of games determining by the computing device an outcome of the wager based on whether the results for the number of games has the statistical characteristic.

determine a first amount of consideration i.e. anything of true value or such as cash or gaming chips that are redeemable for cash bet by a first player on a first game 

determine a second amount of consideration won by the first player from the first game e.g. determine a payout of the first game 

determine a third amount of consideration bet by a second player on a second game determine a fourth amount of consideration won by the second player from the second game 

determine a first performance metric for the first player based on at least one of a the first amount of consideration and b the second amount of consideration the first performance metric may include any statistic numerical indicator or other indicator describing or summarizing the performance of the first player 

determine a second performance metric for the second player based on at least one of a the third amount of consideration and b the fourth amount of consideration 

determine whether the first performance metric is superior to the second performance metric the first performance metric may be superior to the second performance metric in that it better satisfies the goal or objective of a contest or competition between the first and second players e.g. the goal of a contest may be to win more money than the other player and

award a prize to the first player based on whether the first performance metric is superior to the second performance metric. The prize may take the form of a monetary payout merchandise services or any other prize.

Thus for example the apparatus may show the current standings of the first player and the second player within a tournament contest or competition. The players may be listed according to who is in the lead. For example the player in the lead may be listed first. In various embodiments the first player and the second player may be listed together with the names of other players in the same competition.

receive from the first player an indication of which of the second and third players that the first bet is made on 

determine a first outcome stemming from the second bet e.g. the outcome of the game on which the second bet was made 

determine a first performance metric for the second player based on at least one of a the second bet and b the first outcome 

determine a second performance metric for the third player based on at least one of a the third bet and b the second outcome 

provide to the first player a payment based on the first bet the indication of which of the second and third players that the first bet is made on and whether the first performance metric is superior to the second performance metric.

In various embodiments the first player bets that either the second player or the third player will perform better according to some metric. The first player may bet for example that the second player will win more money than does the third player.

Thus for example the first performance metric may represent a net amount won by the second player e.g. a difference between the first payout and the second bet.

determine an amount won by the second player over a time period during which the second player made the second bet.

determine a number of outcomes of a particular type that the second player receives during a time period which includes the time period during which the second player receives the first outcome.

cause to be displayed if the second player does wish to automatically copy the decision a first background color 

cause to be displayed if the second player does not wish to automatically copy the decision a second background color 

determine a payment for the second player based on an amount of the bet and based on the third outcome.

In various embodiments a second player may piggyback upon the outcomes achieved by a first player. The second player may receive the benefit of the same outcomes. The second player may even choose to automatically copy or mimic the decisions made by the first player so that final outcomes achieved by the second player are the same as those achieved by the first player. To automatically follow the decisions made by the first player the second player may put his player device e.g. mobile gaming device into a particular mode or state. The device may then display a first background color indicating that decisions of the first player will be followed automatically. If the second player does not wish to automatically follow the decisions of the first player however then second player may put his device into a different mode. In this different mode the device may allow the second player to input his own decisions or to at least confirm decisions made by the first player. In this different mode the device may display a different background color.

receive if the second player does wish to automatically copy the decision an indication of a fourth outcome received by the first player in the game in which to provide a third outcome includes to provide a third outcome for the second player that is equivalent to the fourth outcome.
