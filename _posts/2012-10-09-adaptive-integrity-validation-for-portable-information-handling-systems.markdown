The present invention relates in general to the field of information handling system security and more particularly to adaptive integrity validation for portable information handling systems.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

Information handling systems are typically built from a variety of components that cooperate to process information. As the capabilities of information handling system components have improved over time information handling system manufacturers have packed an increasing amount of processing capability in ever smaller housings. For example information handling systems have transitioned from stationary desktop configurations to portable laptop configurations. A typical laptop information handling system operates in much the same manner as a desktop information handling system but also includes an integrated display keyboard battery and wireless network interface so that the laptop information handling system functions free of any wired connections. Many end users have come to appreciate the convenience of laptop information handling systems and have adopted laptop systems as replacements for desktop systems. More recently laptop information handling systems have transitioned into tablet and smartphone configurations that provide even greater portability than clamshell type laptop configurations since the tablet and smartphone configurations typically do not include a physical keyboard. Instead tablet and smartphone information handling systems generally include a touchscreen that presents a keyboard through which an end user can input information.

Tablet and smartphone information handling systems provide increased portability and are typically used most often to consume information rather than create information. For instance tablet information handling systems have a relatively small form factor that allows an end user to rapidly power up the system and access information through publicly available wireless networks. Through the course of a day an end user might access information through multiple Wi Fi WLAN and wireless wide area networks WWAN . A tablet information handling system provides a convenient tool for web browsing document review and e mail reading however if an end user needs to write a document or reply to an e mail touchscreen keyboards of tablet information handling systems can prove awkward. Often end users will use a more conventional laptop information handling system with an integrated keyboard when document creation tasks arise. Alternatively an end user may interface a peripheral keyboard with a tablet information handling system to input information for document creation. Even when a tablet information handling system uses a keyboard peripheral tablet information handling systems typically have more limited processing and memory resources than laptop or desktop systems that provide a slower user experience for complex document creation tasks.

One difficulty with using all types of information handling systems is the danger presented by viruses and malware that cause damage to and sometimes steal information stored on an information handling system. Conventional information handling systems typically include virus and malware detection capabilities that scan information stored on an information handling system and remove malicious software when detected. Typical virus and malware protection software runs in the background at an information handling system to scan for known malware virus trojan horse and other types of malicious code. For example anti virus software performs threat updates and threat scans at scheduled times such as system boot or initialization of resources in a static manner. Generally conventional information handling systems experience minimal impacts from the operation of virus and malware protection software. In contrast tablet information handling systems lack the processing resources and internal power storage to support processing for active malware scanning in the same manner as more powerful laptop and desktop information handling systems. Continuous scanning for malware and viruses can impact the usability of a tablet system by slowing other tasks and reducing battery life.

Therefore a need has arisen for a system and method which provides flexible and adaptive processing tools to balance tablet information handling system integrity validation capabilities based upon real time operating conditions such as threats power status and usage profiles.

In accordance with the present invention a system and method are provided which substantially reduce the disadvantages and problems associated with previous methods and systems for protecting an information handling system from security threats. Resources at an information handling system are analyzed against threat status to dynamically adjust anti malware settings. Dynamic response to change resource use and threats provides improved anti malware response with more efficient use of system resources so that the impact of an anti malware response on a user experience at an information handling system is reduced.

More specifically an adaptive mobile integrity validation system interfaces with plural information handling systems to dynamically adapt anti malware settings of the plural information handling systems based upon threats and available resources for responding to the threats. Information handling systems receive messages from the adaptive mobile integrity validation system such as resource interrogation modification request RI MR scripts that direct execution of instructions regarding resource use and threat status. An integrity validation module operating on the information handling system applies the resource use and threat status to adjust settings of an anti malware application running on the information handling system. For example the integrity validation module adjusts anti malware application settings based upon resource use such as battery or power status memory status storage capacity and processor activity based upon physical location such as a GPS location out of a country enterprise location or employee home based upon communications such as a network interface with an unsecured versus secured WLAN a network interface in a WWAN a roaming network interface a trusted network interface and a network interfaced based from a predetermined country and based upon a threat status. The integrity validation module can report on operating system and firmware specifics such as with systems and processes that use knowledge of operating system specific vulnerabilities to modify behavior like an increase in checks for older and unpatched operating systems. Each information handling system interfaced with an adaptive integrity validation system applies a RI MR script to modify anti malware settings so that component resources of the information handling system have a balanced use relative to a defined threat such as by allocating resources to scan for one or more threats in a more aggressive manner while conserving resources for reduced end user impact by less aggressive scanning related to threats of lower significance while aggressive scanning takes place for other threats.

The present invention provides a number of important technical advantages. One example of an important technical advantage is that an adaptive mobile integrity validation system and framework supports the checking of portable information handling system devices for security breaches in a manner that trades off resource impacts based upon the severity of a perceived threat. Integrity validation is adjusted for the type of information handling system and its usage model. For example reduced processing workloads for malware scanning are applied at a tablet or smartphone information handling system in order to prevent undue impacts on battery life and system response. Adjustments to integrity validation operations are made based upon a determined threat state in order to ensure adequate resources are applied to system security with minimal impact on system operations.

Portable information handling systems such as tablets and smartphones dynamically adjust anti malware settings to respond to changing threats and changing resource use. For purposes of this disclosure an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute classify process transmit receive retrieve originate switch store display manifest detect record reproduce handle or utilize any form of information intelligence or data for business scientific control or other purposes. For example an information handling system may be a personal computer a network storage device or any other suitable device and may vary in size shape performance functionality and price. The information handling system may include random access memory RAM one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit CPU or hardware or software control logic ROM and or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output I O devices such as a keyboard a mouse and a video display. The information handling system may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts an adaptive mobile integrity validation system for managing integrity validation of portable information handling systems . In the example embodiment depicted by portable information handling system is a tablet information handling system having a processor to process information and random access memory RAM interfaced with processor to store information is support of processor operations. Processor and RAM are disposed in a portable housing such as a single piece housing having a touchscreen display disposed over processor and RAM . Housing also supports other components interfaced with processor that perform storage processing and communication tasks. For example non volatile storage is provided by a solid state device . A chipset includes firmware such as a BIOS that coordinates interactions between processor and other components. For example firmware boots processor to an operational state by retrieving an operating system from solid state drive . As another example firmware includes instructions that execute on an embedded controller to manage power provided by a battery and power supply interfaced with external power . In the example embodiment the chipset includes a Trusted Processing Unit Secure Element TPU SE architecture that provides enhanced system security such as by restricting access to secure elements so that malware has greater difficulty penetrating to secure elements. A network interface card NIC provides network communications such as through wireless local area networks WLANs and wireless wide area networks WWANs . In one alternative embodiment portable information handling system is a tablet having a smartphone configuration such as a WWAN interface to the POTS and the Internet. In alternative embodiments portable information handling system has a clamshell configuration with an integrated keyboard. In one alternative embodiment adaptive mobile integrity validation system also manages information handling systems have a non portable configuration such as desktop systems.

Adaptive mobile integrity validation system interacts with portable information handling systems to manage protective measures at plural information handling systems such as to maintain the integrity of the information handling systems from malicious attacks. Adaptive mobile integrity validation system is for example an application executing on a server information handling system that maintains a policy database of acceptable mobile device integrity validation policies and a repository of resource data having a normal or safe mode for mobile devices or a mobile device community. For example repository includes acceptable operating system releases images files applications media hash values system parameters firmware and DNS parameters for a community defined by device type e.g. tablet smartphone model number platform etc. . . . and or device enterprise user e.g. business employees mobile service provider etc. . . . . Adaptive mobile integrity validation system communicates with portable client information handling systems through secure communication protocols such a public or private key encrypted communication through an Internet interface. In one embodiment adaptive mobile integrity validation system is a stand alone system that provides integrity validation services alternatively adaptive mobile integrity validation system operates as an integrated portion of a mobile device management MDM system having defined interfaces with portable information handling systems . When operating as a stand alone system adaptive mobile integrity validation system defines an application programming interface API to interface with mobile device management systems . API supports removal and installation of applications modification of firmware and port parameters retrieval of device parameters and other such functions at portable information handling systems .

Adaptive mobile integrity validation system interfaces with a programming environment which provides a platform for generation of integrity validation information downloads for use by portable information handling systems . For example programming environment outputs a resource investigation modification request RI MR that is provided to portable information handling systems through adaptive mobile integrity validation system . RI MR scripts are created installed and executed in cooperation with programming environment to achieve integrity validation goals such as a response that identifies and neutralizes malware on portable information handling systems . RI MR scripts are pushed down to portable information handling systems that are clients of an adaptive mobile integrity validation system and are executed. For example portable information handling systems include an integrity validation module running as an agent on processor that interfaces as a client of adaptive mobile integrity validation system to retrieve and execute RI MR scripts .

Adaptive mobile integrity validation system interfaces with a threat management center that monitors malware threats and issues threat level alerts by a threat level alert system . In one embodiment threat level alerts are issued with the format of a RI MR script that may be selectively passed on to portable information handling systems . Threat level alert system provides threat levels that indicate a level of vigilance at portable information handling systems for threats of a particular type. For example a newly detected virus that spreads by e mail attachments can result in an adjustment to threat monitoring at portable information handling systems so that additional system resources are allocated to monitoring for that threat such as by increasing e mail attachment monitoring while leaving other monitoring unchanged. As another example a threat level alert system issues a threat level RI MR script that identifies a fast spreading worm. Adaptive mobile integrity validation system forwards the RI MR script to portable information handling systems along with adjustments to integrity validation monitoring parameters to increase monitoring for signs of the worm while maintaining constant resource usage by decreasing integrity validation monitoring of other malware threats.

Adaptive mobile integrity validation system interacts with client portable information handling systems through an integrity validation module running on a processor or other processing resource such as a trusted processing resource in chipset . In one embodiment integrity validation module is a module within an anti malware application stored in memory of portable information handling system . In an alternative embodiment integrity validation module is separate from anti malware application and distributed across plural components of portable information handling system . Integrity validation module includes instructions that receive RI MR scripts and perform functions defined by the scripts such as executing instructions to analyze identified resources like the ports open at the system resource or file hash generation and component status. Integrity validation module performs script functions with schedule invocations of a scheduler or with a trigger invocation associated with an event such as receipt of an e mail or establishment of a network interface. In alternative embodiments multiple targeted resource and algorithm combinations can be invoked. Integrity validation module provides immediate scheduled and or triggered updates as set by programming environment . Integrity validation functions at a portable information handling system may be performed with multiple RI MR scripts to target systems at a lowest common denominator so that processing resources of a system are not unnecessarily wasted by non relevant RI MR scripts. For example RI MR scripts are sent only to portable information handling systems that are vulnerable to a threat so that resources of non threatened portable information handling systems are not wasted addressing non relevant threats.

Integrity validation module performs analysis on portable information handling systems to include components individually sequenced triggered by status changes and algorithmically combined. The analysis targets anti malware settings of anti malware application against relevant threats on a per system basis so that system resources are not unnecessarily burdened with non relevant threat responses. For example component status of a portable information handling system is analyzed by a resource status module such as logic running on an embedded controller to adjust anti malware settings with a resource allocator . In example embodiments component status includes battery charge the availability of external power memory capacity memory utilization storage and processor activity. For instance the frequency of malware scans are adjusted based upon the processing and power resources available for the scans. In another embodiment a location status module such as GPS receiver provides location information so that a location allocator can adjust anti malware settings based upon location. For instance anti malware scan frequency or scan type is adjusted if portable information handling system is located in a different country at an enterprise location or at a home location. As an example location map provides threat status for locations that location allocator applies to determine anti malware settings. In another embodiment a communication status module such as logic running in a NIC or chipset analyzes network communications interfaced with portable information handling system so that a communication allocator adjusts anti malware settings based upon the analyzed network communications. For instance a Wi Fi network detected by a WNIC a roaming network provided by a WWAN interface or an enterprise home network interface are compared against a map to establish anti malware settings. In another embodiment a threat level allocator and threat level module interface with threat management center to adjust anti malware settings according to identified threats. For instance a RI MR script identifies potentially infected or modified applications vulnerable ports vulnerable DNS and vulnerable firmware potentially infected system or kernel files and untrustworthy configuration settings. Threat level module determines relevant threats from the RI MR script and provides the relevant threats to threat allocator . Threat allocator adjusts anti malware settings to focus resources of portable information handling system on system specific threats for less resource intrusive malware monitoring. Adaptive mobile integrity validation system tracks communications with portable information handling systems in a real time log including reports of malware detections. A reporter provides threat management center with reports of malware detections and responses.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a process for allocating information handling system resources to threat response. The process begins at step with creation of a RI MR script to address a malware threat. The RI MR script defines the threat and resource allocation rules for managing the threat at predetermined information handling systems. At step the RI MR script is sent to the adaptive mobile integrity system for distribution to information handling systems. At step the adaptive mobile integrity validation system identifies information handling systems associated with the RI MR script. For example RI MR scripts can issue based upon a variety of needs such as the enterprise that owns the information handling system the model of information handling system specific components on information handling systems like a BIOS or operating system the type of platform used to support the components etc. . . . . At step a determination is made of whether a RI MR script is relevant for an information handling system under the management of the adaptive mobile integrity validation system. For instance a RI MR script issued by an enterprise for a threat to a WINDOWs operating system may not be relevant to enterprise systems that run an ANDROID operating system. If the RI MR script is not relevant the process goes to step to the next system or RI MR script. If a RI MR script is relevant for one or more information handling systems the process continues to step to download the RI MR script to information handling systems to which it is relevant.

Once a RI MR script is loaded to a portable information handling system the process continues to step to determine at the information handling system whether the RI MR script is relevant. If not the update is discarded at step . If the update is relevant at step the process continues to step to apply the RI MR script to adjust the portable information handling system integrity validation settings. As an example the RI MR script provides two new threats to the information handling system one a Trojan horse that downloads if an infected file is executed from a web browser the other a worm that has rapidly spread with e mail communications. The information handling system applies information extracted from the RI MR script to adjust settings of an anti malware application for the two new threats. Since the Trojan horse presents only at infected websites it presents less of a threat and is included in normal malware detection scans. Since the worm presents a rapidly spreading threat settings the anti malware application are adjusted to focus processing resources on detecting and stopping the worm threat. If the threat level remains constant resources assigned at the information handling system for running the anti malware application remain constant but a greater amount of resources are focused on detection of worms in e mail. For example the frequency of non email anti malware functions is reduced to allow an increase in e mail anti malware functions. If the worm had an increased threat level associated with it then additional resources of the information handling system would be made available for anti malware functions at the risk of an impact to the end user experience. In alternative embodiments alternative dynamic trade offs may apply between how resources are assigned to anti malware functions and how many resources are assigned to anti malware functions as threats are identified to an information handling system.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a process for adjusting anti malware settings in response to physical component use. The process starts at step with analysis of physical component resources of an information handling system. The analysis includes broad system information such as the model or platform type and specific component types and also includes the status of components at a particular time period such as the battery charge power draw memory utilization storage utilization processing activity and screen activity. At step the resource availability determined from the analysis is compared with the threat status. If the available resources and threat are aligned the process continues to step to continue use of current anti malware settings and to step to repeat the analysis on a periodic or other basis. If the available resources and threat status are not aligned the process continues to step to dynamically adjust anti malware settings for resource use and then to step to repeat analysis on a periodic or other basis.

At step comparison of resource availability with a threat level can involve a number of different approaches in various embodiments. One resource to consider is the charge status of an internal battery the availability of external power and the power drawn by end user activity. If power availability is low relative to end user activity then anti malware settings are selectively reduced for a given threat level. For instance if an end user is approaching the end of battery life anti malware settings suspend anti malware activity to limit power draw such as by disabling automatically initiated anti malware scans. On the other hand if an end user has left the system fully charged on an external power source without end user activity then at the same threat level a full system scan is accomplished. Similar adjustments are made to anti malware settings for memory and processor utilizations so that end user activity at the information handling system is not interfered with by anti malware functions. If the threat level changes anti malware settings adjust for a given resource availability so that resource use remains balanced relative to the threat. For instance an increased threat increases the number of anti malware scans the frequency of anti malware scans and or the memory and processor resources dedicated to anti malware functions. In one embodiment an increased threat level results in increased anti malware activity directed towards a specific threat while other anti malware settings remain the same. For instance a specific type of scan is increased such as with more frequent e mail scans. As one example when a tablet system interfaces to a keyboard detection of the keyboard adjusts anti malware scans to focus more component resources on end user document creation applications. Other types of adjustments to anti malware settings may be used such as those described with position and communication analysis.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a process for adjusting anti malware settings in response to a physical location. The process starts at step with analysis of the physical position of the information handling system such as provided by a GPS receiver. At step the physical position is compared with the threat to determine whether anti malware settings are aligned with the threat for the detected position. If the anti malware settings are aligned for the threat and position the process continues to step to continue use of the current anti malware settings and to step for continued analysis on a periodic or other basis. If the anti malware settings are not aligned with the position and threat the process continues to step to dynamically adjust the anti malware settings. In one example embodiment the comparison with physical position compares the detected position with defined safe and unsafe positions such as those stored in a memory map of the information handling system. If the information handling system is in a safe zone such as within an enterprise site or end user home anti malware settings may be relaxed to provide greater resource availability for other applications. If the information handling system is in an unsafe zone such as outside of the country of the end user or within a competitor s or supplier s office anti malware settings may be increased to provide increased security. As an example in a safe position certain types of files may be executed without restriction such as e mail attachments while those same files may be prohibited from execution in an unsafe zone. As another example in a safe zone network ports may retrieve information without restriction while in an unsafe zone only a network port associated with a virtual private network may be allowed to retrieve information. Other types of adjustments to anti malware settings may be used such as those described with resource and communication analysis.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a process for adjusting anti malware settings in response to a network interface. The process starts at step with analysis of the network interface of the information handling system such as a WLAN WWAN or other type of network interface. For instance a WLAN is analyzed as less safe if unsecured and more safe if secured. As another example a WWAN is analyzed as less safe if through a roaming connection and more safe if through an known wireless carrier. Other examples include varying degrees of safety associated with known corporate interfaces or encrypted interfaces. At step the network interface is compared with the threat status to determine if anti malware settings are aligned with the threat. If so the process continues to step to continue using the current anti malware settings and to step to analyze network interfaces on a periodic or other basis. If the network interface analysis and threat status are not aligned with current malware settings the process continues to step to dynamically adjust the anti malware settings. For example the type of scan used to detect malware is adjusted based upon the type of network setting such as prohibiting execution of downloaded files while in an unsafe network area while allowing execution of certain downloaded files without an anti malware scan when in a safe network. As another example a first rate of anti malware scan frequency is applied in a first network area and a second rate of anti malware scan frequency is applied in a second network area. Other types of adjustments to anti malware settings may be used such as those described with resource and position analysis.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a process for adjusting anti malware settings in response to a threat update. The process begins at step with analysis of a threat update at step such as a new threat or change in threat level provided from an adaptive mobile integrity validation system. At step a comparison is made of the threat update with the threat state to determine if anti malware settings are aligned with the threat update. If so the process continues to step to continue use of the anti malware settings and to step to analyze threat updates on a periodic or other basis. If the anti malware settings are not aligned with the threat state based on the threat update the process continues to step to dynamically adjust the anti malware settings for the threat update. In one embodiment threat levels are provided with threat updates such as a low medium and high threat level each having associated resource allocations for anti malware settings. Threat levels can result in dynamic adjustments to anti malware settings that have an immediate effect or that are triggered by predetermined activities such as downloading or executing predetermined files. As an example increasing threat levels result in increased threat protection by an anti malware application at the expense of power consumption until the threat level subsides.

Although the present invention has been described in detail it should be understood that various changes substitutions and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
