Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to monitoring methods and systems for monitoring an object during an athletic activity. More particularly embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and systems for monitoring the movement of a sport ball used by an individual during an athletic activity.

Athletic activity is important to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and is a source of entertainment for many people. Some individuals prefer to engage in team athletic activities such as for example soccer or basketball while other individuals prefer to engage in individual athletic activities such as for example running or skiing. Regardless of whether the activity is a team or individual activity it is common for individuals to participate in both competitive sessions such as a soccer match or a running race and more informal training sessions such as conducting soccer drills or running interval sprints.

Technology has resulted in the development of fitness monitoring devices that are capable of recording information about an individual s performance during an athletic activity using sensors and in some cases providing feedback about the individual s performance. Some portable fitness monitoring devices employ sensors attached to the individual s body while other portable fitness monitoring devices rely on sensors attached to a piece of athletic equipment. Such sensors may be capable of measuring various physical and or physiological parameters associated with the individual s physical activity.

Many existing fitness monitoring devices are not portable and thus are not suitable for monitoring in many real world competitive or training sessions. Even those that are portable are often too heavy or lack sufficient battery and or processing power to be used for extended periods under rigorous competitive or training conditions. In addition while some existing fitness monitoring devices are capable of making relatively simple performance determinations such as an individual s current heart rate or total step count for an activity more advanced determinations are often not possible or suffer from accuracy issues. Finally the performance feedback provided by existing devices to individuals often fails to provide these individuals with quick accurate insightful information that would enable them to easily compare past performances develop strategies for improving future performances visualize performances or select new training regimens or athletic equipment.

The network may also be employed for communication between any two or more of the sensor module the personal computer the server and a docking unit. In an embodiment of the present invention information is directly communicated between the sensor module and the server via the network thus bypassing the personal computer .

A variety of information may be communicated between any of the sensor module the personal computer the network the server or other electronic components such as for example another sensor module a mobile phone a tablet computer or other portable electronic devices. Such information may include for example performance parameter data device settings including sensor module settings software and firmware.

Communication among the various elements of the present invention may occur after the athletic activity has been completed or in real time during the athletic activity. In addition the interaction between for example the sensor module and the personal computer and the interaction between the personal computer and the server may occur at different times.

In some embodiments of the present invention an individual using the athletic activity monitoring system may participate in the activity with the sensor module physically coupled to the individual s body or to a piece of athletic equipment but with no other portable electronic devices making up part of the athletic activity monitoring system in the individual s immediate vicinity. In such an embodiment the sensor module would monitor the athletic activity using its sensors. The sensor module may also perform calculations necessary to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment or perform calculations necessary to determine a correlation between body or equipment movement data and an activity metric.

Alternatively in this scenario other components of the athletic activity monitoring system that are remotely located from the individual during the activity could be relied upon to perform calculations necessary to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment or perform calculations necessary to determine a correlation between body or equipment movement data and an activity metric. This could occur for example after wireless transmission of athletic performance information directly from the sensor module to a personal computer or a server during or after the activity or after a wired transmission of athletic performance information directly from the sensor module to a personal computer after the activity.

However in other embodiments of the present invention as illustrated in the sensor module may communicate with a portable electronic device of the athletic activity monitoring system that is also carried by the individual during the athletic activity. In some embodiments the portable electronic device may be carried by another person besides the individual or not carried by any person. In some embodiments the portable electronic device may be a watch a mobile phone a tablet computer or other portable electronic device.

The portable electronic device may serve a variety of purposes including for example providing additional data processing providing additional data storage providing data visualization providing additional sensor capabilities relaying information to a network or providing for the playback of music.

In one embodiment of the present invention the portable electronic device may be a dedicated portable electronic device . The term dedicated portable electronic device indicates that the portable electronic device is not capable of serving another purpose outside of the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention. For example a mobile phone a personal digital assistant or a digital music file player e.g. an MP3 player may not be considered to be dedicated portable electronic monitoring devices as the term is used herein. In this manner the dedicated portable electronic monitoring device may in some embodiments provide a simpler and or more efficient device.

The portable electronic device illustrated in is not a dedicated portable electronic monitoring device the portable electronic device illustrated in is a mobile phone. In alternate embodiments it may be possible for the sensor module itself to be embodied by a mobile phone. Including a portable electronic device in the athletic activity monitoring system such as a mobile phone may be desirable as mobile phones are commonly carried by individuals even when engaging in athletic activities and they are capable of providing significant additional computing and communication power at no additional cost to the individual .

In view of the above discussion it is apparent that various processing steps or other calculations recited herein may be capable of being performed by various embodiments of the athletic activity monitoring system disclosed herein and are not necessarily limited to being performed by the sensor module depending on the configuration of a particular embodiment of the present invention. For example any of the processing steps or other calculations recited herein may be performed in various embodiments by the sensor module by a server computer by a personal computer by a portable electronic device and or any other network component or by more than one component.

Embodiments of the present invention may involve the use of so called cloud computing. Cloud computing may include the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility over a network typically the Internet . Cloud computing may entrust services typically centralized with a user s data software and computation on a published application programming interface over a network. End users may access cloud based applications through a web browser or a light weight desktop or mobile app while the business software and data are stored on servers at a remote location. Cloud application providers often strive to give the same or better service and performance than if the software programs were installed locally on end user computers.

In an exemplary embodiment the portable electronic device and or the sensor module may include a sensor garment a heart rate monitor and a position sensor.

In some exemplary embodiments group monitoring device may be used by a coach.

Sensor modules may be mounted to individuals in preparation for participation by individuals in a session of athletic activity. Sensor modules mounted to a particular individual may be coupled either via wires or wirelessly to a portable electronic device also mounted on the particular individual . The sensor modules may sense characteristics about individuals during participation by individuals in the session of athletic activity and transmit data indicative of the characteristics to the portable electronic device . The portable electronic device in turn transmits the data to base station during the session of athletic activity. In some embodiments the sensor module and the portable electronic device may be integrated into a single device. In additional embodiments as further illustrated in a sensor module may be capable of communicating directly with a base station without transmitting data via the portable electronic device .

In some exemplary embodiments this transmission occurs in real time. Real time as used herein may include delays inherent to transmission technology delays designed to optimize resources and other inherent or desirable delays that would be apparent to one of skill in the art. In some exemplary embodiments this transmission is delayed from real time or may occur after completion of the activity. Base station may receive the data and may determine metrics from the data where the metrics may be representations of the characteristics measured by sensor modules or may be representations of further characteristics derived from the data through the use of algorithms and other data manipulation techniques. Base station in turn may transmit the metrics during the session of athletic activity to group monitoring device which may receive the metrics and display a representation of the metrics.

Group monitoring device may receive metrics associated with a plurality of individuals and may display the received metrics in association with the individuals with which they are associated. In this way a coach viewing group monitoring device during the session of athletic activity receives detailed information about multiple individuals and can act on that information as it is determined necessary or expedient thereby efficiently monitoring and managing individuals during the session of athletic activity.

In some exemplary embodiments sensor module or portable electronic devices calculate metrics based on the data and transfer these metrics to base station along with or instead of the data.

This correction signal can be sent to a sensor module or a portable electronic device e.g. via base station . This correction signal can be used to correct position determinations of sensor module or portable electronic devices thereby increasing their accuracy. Determining such a correction signal and then sending it to sensor module or portable electronic devices achieves efficient use of processing capacity because sensor module or portable electronic devices are not burdened with determining a correction signal themselves but simply receive and use a correction signal determined at base station or reference sensor.

Base station may transmit and receive data from sensor module or portable electronic devices via an antenna configured for one or more of RF communication WLAN communication ISM communication cellular e.g. GSM broad band 2.5G or 3G 4G LTE communication other suitable communication or a combination thereof.

An overview of exemplary embodiments of components of the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention including exemplary sensor modules has been provided above. A description of various exemplary methods of using the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment or to determine a correlation between body or equipment movement data and an activity metric is now provided below.

An individual engaged in an athletic activity or another interested person such as a coach teammate or spectator may desire to obtain information about the motion of the individual s body or the motion of a piece of the individual s athletic equipment during the course of the athletic activity.

For example if the individual is participating in an activity that involves the use of a sport ball such as playing in a soccer match it may be desirable for example to be able to determine the various launch angles at which the soccer ball i.e. football was kicked by the individual to be able to determine the rate of rotation of the soccer ball after it was kicked by the individual or to be able to determine the peak speeds that the soccer ball was traveling at after being kicked by the individual .

As a further example if the individual is participating in an activity that involves various movements the individual s chest such practicing basketball skills it may be desirable for example to be able to identify instances when the individual cut to the left or cut to the right when trying to dribble around a defender to be able to determine the height that the individual jumped the horizontal distance the individual jumped or the force that the individual jumped with when taking jump shots attempting dunks or attempting to block shots or to be able to determine the individual s reaction time when working on basketball related reaction time drills.

By using the athletic activity monitoring system including the sensor module described above embodiments of the present invention may advantageously enable the individual or their coach teammate or a spectator to obtain this or other information about the motion of the individual s body or the motion of a piece of the individual s athletic equipment during or after the course of the athletic activity.

While various embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of the sports of soccer i.e. football and basketball the present invention is not so limited and may be applied in a variety of different sports or athletic activities including for example baseball bowling boxing cricket cycling football i.e. American football golf hockey lacrosse rowing rugby running skateboarding skiing surfing swimming table tennis tennis or volleyball or during training sessions related thereto. In addition activity metrics described as being capable of being determined in soccer may be capable of being determined in basketball or vice versa when appropriate.

Data obtained by the sensor module may be processed in a variety of ways to yield useful information about the motion of an object of interest during the activity. In some embodiments sensor module data may be processed to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment . In other embodiment sensor module data may be processed to by reference to a predetermined correlation between movement data and an activity metric stored in a data structure.

Regardless of whether the athletic activity monitoring system and the sensor module are being used to monitor the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment in embodiments of the present invention where there is a desire to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or the piece of the individual s athletic equipment a common analytical framework may be used to carryout the monitoring. This analytical framework is illustrated by .

With reference to in such an embodiment the individual may use the sensor module in the athletic activity monitoring system to determine a change in spatial orientation of the object according to spatial orientation process as follows.

First at step the sensor module may detect movement of the object . In one embodiment movement of the object is detected based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

In one embodiment the magnetic field sensor may be adapted to measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields in the vicinity of the sensor module . In another embodiment the magnetic field sensor may be adapted to measure the strength and direction of the earth s magnetic field in the vicinity of the sensor module . In some embodiments the magnetic field sensor may be capable of measuring the magnitude and direction of a resultant magnetic vector for the total local magnetic field and or for the local earth s magnetic field.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the detected movement may consist of the soccer ball rolling on the ground as a result of being dribbled by the individual . If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the detected movement may consist of the individual s chest moving forward as the individual dribbles a basketball down the court.

In some embodiments the sensor module may then determine that the movement of the object indicates the occurrence of a movement to track. In one embodiment the determination that the movement of the object indicates the occurrence of a movement to track occurs when a threshold data value is met for a predetermined period of time. For example the sensor module may determine that a movement of the object has resulted in a threshold acceleration and or magnetic field change occurring for a predetermined period of time.

In some embodiments the determination of the occurrence of a movement to track is an indication that the movement to track had already begun prior to the determination. In this case it is still possible to capture all of the relevant data relating to the movement as the sensor module may temporarily record a stream of data in a buffer in the event that data that had recently been recorded may need to be examined or more permanently recorded in response to a determination that an occurrence of a movement to track is found. In other embodiments the determination of the occurrence of a movement to track is an indication that the movement to track is about to begin in the near future. In some embodiments the sensor module is adapted to store data permanently or temporarily and may further be adapted to store data for predefined periods of time in certain circumstances such as when populating a data buffer.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball in an attempt to make a goal may result in a determination that the motion of the ball in response to the kick which could include motion of the ball before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the rotation of the individual s chest through one hundred and eighty degrees of rotation when making an offensive movement may result in a determination that the rotation of the individual s chest which could include motion of the individual s chest before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked.

Next as step in response to the determination of the occurrence of a movement to track an initial spatial orientation of the object may be determined. In some embodiments the determination of an initial spatial orientation of the object may be made by reference to a coordinate axis system.

A coordinate axis system is a useful analytical tool for monitoring changes in the spatial orientation of an object . illustrates an exemplary three dimensional Cartesian coordinate axis system having three axes an X axis a Y axis and a Z axis. Two vectors G and B are superimposed on the coordinate axis system illustrated in . The G vector pointing in the Y direction represents a gravity vector. The B vector represents a resultant magnetic field vector.

Returning to the discussion of step in one embodiment the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the object may be made with respect to a gravity vector such as that illustrated in . In another embodiment the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the object may be made with respect to an earth magnetic field vector such as that illustrated in . In other embodiments the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the object may be made with respect to characterizations of the way that the object translated and rotated in three dimensional space with six degrees of freedom as explained with reference to .

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the soccer ball relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. movement of the ball resulting from the kick may be defined for example as the spatial orientation of the soccer ball just before at the moment of or just after the soccer ball was swiftly kicked by the individual s foot depending on the particular application and algorithms used. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the individual s chest relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. the one hundred and eighty degree rotation may be defined for example as the spatial orientation of the individual s chest just before at the moment of or just after the individual s chest began rotating depending on the particular application and algorithms used.

At step after the determination of the initial orientation of the object at a first time has been made a change in the spatial orientation of the object may be determined. In an embodiment the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the object at step may be made similarly to the determination of the initial orientation of the object at step except that additional information about changes in the orientation of the gravity vector and or the magnetic field vector as the object moves may be additionally factored in.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the soccer ball relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. movement of the ball resulting from the kick may be defined for example as the change in spatial orientation of the soccer ball from the time that the initial orientation of the soccer ball was identified to a later point in time when the ball is still moving or has ceased moving depending on the particular application and algorithms used. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. the one hundred and eighty degree rotation may be defined for example as the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest from the time that the initial orientation of the individual s chest was identified to a later point in time when the individual s chest is still moving or has ceased moving depending on the particular application and algorithms used.

At step an activity metric is determined based on the change in the spatial orientation of the object determined in step . The nature of the activity metric may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment the activity metric may relate to for example a launch angle a rate of rotation a ball trajectory a speed a jump height a jump force a jump distance a jump trajectory a kick force a kick distance an impact force a characterization of a specific type of athletic movement or a reaction time measurement. In other embodiments the activity metric may be for example the rate of rotation the plane of rotation the jump force force profile force acting upon the body of the athlete or the ground or the object stroke information in tennis swing profile in golf baseball hockey stick kick profile of a leg angle position of a bike pedal power output of a cyclist fatigue tremors starting to occur in repeated motion i.e. running lifting swimming rowing etc. posture throwing or arm swing technique and shooting technique.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the change in the spatial orientation of the ball resulting from the kick may be used to determine for example a launch angle of the ball a rate of rotation of the ball launch speed estimated speed or similar metrics. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest during the one hundred and eighty degree rotation may be used to determine for example that the individual had been posting up a defender and then executed a one hundred and eighty degree spin move to maneuver around the defender or similar metrics. In other embodiments the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest may be used to determine a jump height or jump force.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the activity metric to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. In one embodiment the output may be an audible visual and or haptic output.

In some embodiments of the present invention instead of a desire to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of an object of interest there may be a desire to correlate movements of objects such as the individual s body or the piece of the individual s athletic equipment to activity metrics based on a predetermined correlation stored in a data structure. A common analytical framework may be used to carry out such correlations. This analytical framework is illustrated by .

With reference to in such an embodiment the individual may use the sensor module in the athletic activity monitoring system to determine such correlations to object movement according to movement correlation process as follows.

First at step the sensor module may detect movement of the object . This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process as described above.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the detected movement may consist of the soccer ball rolling on the ground as a result of being dribbled by the individual . If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the detected movement may consist of the individual s chest moving forward as the individual dribbles a basketball down the court.

In some embodiments the sensor module may then determine that the movement of the object indicates the occurrence of a movement to track. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process as described above.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball in an attempt to make a goal may result in a determination that the motion of the ball in response to the kick which could include motion of the ball before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the movement of the individual s chest sharply upward away from the ground as a result of the individual jumping to for example take a jump shot attempt a dunk or attempt to block a shot may result in a determination that the upward movement of the individual s chest which could include motion of the individual s chest before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked.

Next at step the sensor module may record movement data in response to identifying a movement to track. In one embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball may be recorded. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the movement of the individual s chest sharply upward may be recorded.

Next at step the sensor module may determine a correlation between the recorded movement data and an activity metric. In one embodiment this determination may be based on correlation information stored in a data structure such as a lookup table.

A lookup table is a data structure usually an array or associative array often used to replace a runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation. The savings in terms of processing time can be significant since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing relatively processing expensive computation or input output operation. Lookup table figures may be pre calculated and stored in static program storage or pre fetched as part of a program initialization phase.

The nature of the correlation may depend on the particular application and algorithms used to establish the correlation. Also the nature of the activity metric may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment the activity metric may relate to for example a launch angle a rate of rotation a ball trajectory a speed a jump height a jump force a jump distance a jump trajectory a kick force a kick distance an impact force a characterization of a specific type of athletic movement or a reaction time measurement. In other embodiments the activity metric may be for example the rate of rotation the plane of rotation the jump force force profile force acting upon the body of the athlete or the ground or the object stroke information in tennis swing profile in golf baseball hockey stick kick profile of a leg angle position of a bike pedal power output of a cyclist fatigue tremors starting to occur in repeated motion i.e. running lifting swimming rowing etc. posture throwing or arm swing technique and shooting technique.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the correlation between the recorded movement data and an activity metric may rely on correlation data stored in a data structure that was derived from a function that expresses a relationship between soccer ball acceleration data and soccer ball launch speed metrics. In some embodiments the function underlying the relationship between soccer ball acceleration data and soccer ball launch speed may be based on empirical data for the specific model soccer ball.

If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the correlation between the recorded movement data and an activity metric may rely correlation data stored in a data structure that was derived from a function that expresses a relationship between chest acceleration data and for example jump height or jump force metrics. In some embodiments the function underlying the relationship between chest acceleration data and jump height may be based on data such as for example the individual s weight.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the activity metric to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process as described above.

The analytical frameworks outlined with respect to and detailing the basic spatial orientation process and the basic movement correlation process respectively may be used in embodiments of the present invention to monitor the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment using a sensor module . However in some embodiments of the present invention these basic analytical frameworks may include additional steps that may provide improved capabilities thus offering the individual engaged in athletic activities better tools to assess their activities.

With reference to the active state process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the active state process may occur just prior to the steps of the basic spatial orientation process or the basic movement correlation process so that these processes may be carried out with more efficient sensor module function.

At step the sensor module may detect movement of the object at a first time. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process or step of the movement correlation process as described above.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the detected movement may consist of the soccer ball rolling on the ground as a result of being dribbled by the individual . If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the detected movement may consist of the individual s chest moving forward as the individual dribbles a basketball down the court.

Next at step the sensor module may determine that the movement of the object corresponds to a predetermined activation movement. In some embodiments the predetermined activation movement may include a series of discrete movements such as for example a ball being bounced three times in series the ball being thrown a predetermined height the ball being kicked with a certain level of force the individual jumping up and down three times in series or a movement that results in the acceleration of the sensor module exceeding and or falling below a predetermined threshold in absolute terms or for a predetermined period of time. In one embodiment movement of the object is detected based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

The step of determining that the movement of the object corresponds to a predetermined activation movement may include comparing acceleration data associated with the predetermined activation movement to acceleration data detected in association with the movement of the object. Alternatively the step of determining that the movement of the object corresponds to a predetermined activation movement may include comparing timing data associated with the predetermined activation movement to timing data detected in association with the movement of the object.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the predetermined activation movement could be for example movement of the soccer ball after it had been stationary for a predetermined period of time the soccer ball being bounced three times the soccer ball being thrown into the air a certain height of period of time or a variety of other possible activation movements. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the predetermined activation movement could be for example movement of the individual s chest after the individual had been stationary for a predetermined period of time e.g. sitting on the bench the individual jumping up and down three times in a row the individual squatting three times in a row or a variety of other possible activation movements.

In some embodiments the monitored object can be considered stationary when the sensor module of the monitored object senses resultant acceleration of about 1 G i.e. resultant acceleration within a threshold tolerance of 1 G for example within 5 of 1 G . In some embodiments the monitored object can be considered stationary at times while being handled by an individual. For example a ball can be stationary for a period of time in which a basketball player takes a jump shot with ball e.g. before release of ball from the hands of the individual the ball can be considered stationary where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G . Also for example the ball can be stationary for a period of time in which a baseball player performs a throw of ball e.g. a period of time spanning the transition from rearward motion to forward motion of the individual s throwing motion where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G .

Next at step after determining that an activation movement has occurred the sensor module may enter the active state. As previously described the active state may be characterized for example by the sensor module consuming more power or sampling data at a higher rate during the active state than prior to the active state.

Finally at step upon the sensor module entering the active state detection of movement of the object at a second time as detailed at step of the basic spatial orientation process or at step of the basic movement correlation process . In this way enabling various states may allow the sensor module to operate with reduced battery power reduced processing power or otherwise be more efficient.

With reference to the reference motion process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the reference motion process may effectively be substituted for step and of the basic movement correlation process outlined above so that the correlation and identification capabilities are enhanced.

At step the sensor module may record movement data possibly in response to identifying a movement to track in a previous step as outlined above . In one embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball may be recorded. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the movement of the individual s chest sharply upward may be recorded.

Next at step the sensor module may identify a matching athletic motion from a plurality of reference motions by comparing the movement data to data associated with the plurality of reference motions. In one embodiment as with step of the basic movement correlation process the identification may be made at least in part based on correlation information stored in a data structure such as a lookup table.

Particular to step identification of the matching athletic motion may be by reference to a plurality of reference motions. In other words at step the system is not limited to looking for a motion that matches a single motion e.g. kicking a soccer ball in an effort to score a goal . In some embodiments the system is not limited to looking for a motion that matches a single class of motions e.g. offensive soccer motions . In other embodiments the system is not limited to looking for a motion that matches motions in a single sport e.g. soccer motions . Alternatively when the activity is a team sport the matching athletic motion may be a motion commonly executed by a person during that team sport.

In one embodiment one or more of the reference motions may include a series of discrete movements. In some embodiments data associated with the plurality of reference motions may include acceleration data magnetic field data and or timing data. Of course the nature of the identifying matching athletic motion may depend on the particular application and algorithms used to establish the match. Also the nature of the matching athletic motion may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment related to basketball the matching athletic motion may be for example a pass motion an shot motion an jump shot motion a dunk motion a post up motion a cross over dribble motion a shot blocking motion a steal motion or a rebound motion.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the matching athletic motion to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the movement correlation process as described above. In this way the athletic motion identification capabilities of the movement correlation process may be enhanced by enabling identification and tracking of diverse types of motions executed during an activity.

With reference to the remote spatial processing or correlation process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the remote spatial processing or correlation process may effectively be substituted for step of the basic spatial orientation process or step of the basic movement correlation process outlined above so that activity metric determination may occur remotely.

At step a change in the spatial orientation of the object may be determined or movement data may be recorded. In an embodiment the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the object or the recordation of movement data at step may be made similarly to the determination of the change in spatial orientation of the object at step of the basic spatial orientation process outlined above or to the recording of movement data at step of the basic movement correlation process .

Next at step the sensor module may wirelessly transmit data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement to a computer wherein the computer is remotely located from the user during the athletic activity. For example the remote computer may be server . In one embodiment the data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement may be transmitted to the remote computer during the athletic activity. In another embodiment the data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement may be transmitted to the remote computer after the athletic activity has been completed.

Next at step the sensor module may wirelessly receive activity metric data from the remote computer wherein the activity metric data is based on the transmitted data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement. Accordingly the determination of the activity metric as outlined for example at step of the basic spatial orientation process the determination of the activity metric based on correlation data possibly with reference to a lookup table as outlined for example at step of the basic movement correlation process may be handled by the remote computer. In one embodiment the activity metric data may be received from the remote computer during the athletic activity. In another embodiment the activity metric data may be received from the remote computer after the athletic activity has been completed.

In addition in certain embodiments because of the greater processing capabilities and resources of the remote computer the remote computer may be capable of providing additional information to the sensor module . In one embodiment the sensor module may receive training recommendation data from the remote computer in addition to the activity metric data. In another embodiment the sensor module may receive motivational content data from the remote computer in addition to the activity metric data.

In an embodiment the activity metric data received from the remote computer may include a comparison between data associated with the user for the present athletic activity and data associated with the user from a previous athletic activity. In another embodiment the activity metric data received from the remote computer may include a comparison between data associated with the user for the present athletic activity and data associated with a different individual s athletic activity.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the activity metric to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process or to step of the movement correlation process as described above. In this way the spatial processing or movement determining capabilities of the athletic activity monitoring system may be enhanced by shifting certain processing and analytical tasks to a remotely located computer such as a server computer with greater computational abilities and in some embodiments access to additional data or other resources.

With reference to the location process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the location process may occur after the steps of the basic spatial orientation process or the basic movement correlation process or just prior to the output steps of these processes.

At step the activity metric may be determined based on a change in the spatial orientation of the object as described at step of the spatial orientation process or based on the correlation described at step of the movement correlation process . The nature of the activity metric may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment the activity metric may relate to for example a launch angle a rate of rotation a speed a jump height jump force a characterization of a specific type of athletic movement or a reaction time measurement.

Next at step the location of the object during the athletic activity may be determined. In one embodiment the location of the object during the athletic activity is determined using a satellite positioning system receiver such as a GPS Galileo BeiDou or GLONASS receiver. In another embodiment the location of the object during the athletic activity is determined using a beacon signal or radio signal triangulation.

In embodiments where the individual s physical activity includes traversing a specific route e.g. running or biking in a race the sensor module may capable of recording an individual s geographic way points along the route traversed.

Finally at step a determined athletic activity metric may be correlated with the location associated with the athletic activity metric. Accordingly for example the sensor module may capable of recording where an individual took each soccer or basketball shot.

For example in one embodiment an individual or a piece of athletic equipment used by the individual during strength and flexibility workouts may carry a sensor module that is capable of tracking for example sit ups push ups lunges jumping jacks pull ups squats dips and or calf raises. The sensor module may be capable of being used to determine whether these movements are being done correctly and or how many repetitions of each movement were conducted.

In some embodiments of the present invention the sensor module may be capable of compensating for inherent deficiencies that may be present for various types of sensor contained within or in communication with the sensor module . Most real world sensors have limitations. For example accelerometers magnetometers and gyroscopes may have accuracy issues particularly when used at speeds of motion of the object or under other conditions that differ from their initial calibration conditions.

In some systems if sensor data such as acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data is temporarily lost or otherwise unavailable the data from the unavailable sensor is not used in subsequent processing or calculations. In other systems lost data may be estimated by straight line methods where for example it is assumed that the data stays constant or changes at a constant rate. However in some embodiments of the present invention sensor data such as one of acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data may be used to compensate for and or estimate the changes in the other of acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data based on known derived or estimate correlations between the two types of data or data extrapolation.

By combining the data produced by for example acceleration sensor and a magnetic field sensor systems and methods according to embodiments of the present invention are able to more accurately determine absolute data values or activity metrics even when data from one of the acceleration sensor or the magnetic field sensor is lost for any reason. Using the data that is not missing the system can continue to provide data values or activity metrics to fill in the holes until the missing data is regained or otherwise again sampled.

In other embodiments of the present invention angular momentum sensor data such as gyroscope data may be used in combination with one or more of acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data for data calibration and or extrapolation.

In some embodiments of the present invention calibration and or generation of correction factor data for a acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor based sensor modules may be performed under a variety of different use conditions e.g. calibration data or correction factors may be generated for use at different movement speeds for use with an individual s body with a piece of athletic equipment for use in different sports for use under different wind conditions for use under different court or field conditions etc. Moreover this variety of correction factors and or calibration data may be collected in the background over time as the individual continues using the system. In this manner a lookup table or other universe or library of calibration data or correction factors may be built up and stored in the monitoring system optionally in the portable portion of the system such that an appropriate correction factor could be generated and applied for a full range of individual or athletic equipment speeds and or other use conditions.

A microprocessor provided with the system optionally in the portable portion of the system in the personal computer etc. may be programmed to interpolate between and or extrapolate from known calibration or correction factors to arrive at the most appropriate calibration or correction factor for use at any speed or other use condition s . Also in this manner different calibration or correction factors may be applied at different times during a single athletic performance e.g. based on the speed or other use conditions determined at a given time during the performance to further help improve the overall accuracy of the speed and distance monitor. By having a variety of correction or calibration factors available under different performance conditions the sensor module will tend to become more accurate particularly over time and with increased use because of the increased number of calibration and correction factors generated with increased use.

In one embodiment of the present invention the sensor module may be affected by perturbations in local magnetic fields such as the earth s magnetic field. Perturbation can be caused for example by objects with ferromagnetic structures. In some embodiments the local magnetic field may be more variable at certain distances near the surface of the earth than at other distances further away from the earth. For example the local magnetic field may be more variable or perturbed within approximately six feet of the surface of the earth than at more than approximately six feet away from the surface of the earth. Accordingly in some embodiments magnetic field sensor data obtained from an object when the object is more than approximately six feet away from the surface of the earth may be used to extrapolate or otherwise estimate proper or likely magnetic field sensor data from when the object was within approximately six feet of the surface of the earth if the magnetic field sensor data from when the object was within approximately six feet of the surface of the earth is otherwise deemed to be unreliable due to the relatively high variability in local magnetic fields such as the earth s magnetic field near the surface of the earth.

In some embodiments a magnetic field sensor may obtain data about the movement of the object at a first time when the magnetic field sensor is significantly influenced by a perturbed magnetic field. Then obtain data about the movement of the object at a second time when the magnetic field sensor is not significantly influenced by a perturbed magnetic field. After this data is captured the sensor module may determine that the data about the movement of the object at the first time is not acceptable and may estimate data about the movement of the object at the first time based on the data about the movement of the object at the second time.

In various embodiments of the present invention described above an individual or another interested person such as a coach teammate or spectator may obtain information about the motion of the individual s body or the motion of a piece of the individual s athletic equipment during the course of the athletic activity. Once an activity metric or specific athletic movement has been identified by the monitoring system to the extent that the activity metric or specific athletic movement was not entirely optimal correct the system may further be employed to train or coach the user to improve their activity metric or specific athletic movement in the future. Determinations of what activity metric value or specific athletic movement characteristic is optimal correct may be made automatically by the system based on predetermined values algorithms or other data stored in a database look up table or the like or the determination may be made by a live trainer coach the individual themselves or another interested person with access to the activity metric value or specific athletic movement data.

For example in embodiments where the monitored object is a soccer ball where the change in the spatial orientation of the ball resulting from a kick is used to determine for example a launch angle of the ball a rate of rotation of the ball launch speed estimated speed or similar metrics these determinations may be used by the system to help the individual improve their launch angle a rate of rotation or launch speed in future kicks. Methods used to achieve improvements may be for example providing cross training workouts or drills to the individual providing soccer specific workouts or drills to the individual or prescribing a number of other training regimens.

As a further example in embodiments where the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball and the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest during a jump shot is used to determine a jump height or jump force these determinations may be used by the system to help the individual improve their jump shots and or jump height force. Methods used to achieve improvements may be for example providing cross training workouts or drills to the individual providing basketball specific workouts or drills to the individual or prescribing a number of other training regimens.

In some embodiments of the present invention the monitoring system may also include or interact with an interactive retail system. The interactive retail system could be for example presented to an individual via a screen on the individual s portable electronic device . The interactive retail system could provide a platform for selecting and or ordering products offered by the provider of the system. Based on the activity metric or specific athletic movement provided by the monitoring system and or based on any training or coaching provided as described above the interactive retail system could suggest specific products or product lines that may be helpful to the individual in improving their future performance. In some embodiments personal data about the individual stored by the monitoring system may also be used in making the determination of suitable products or product lines.

For example a soccer player trying to improve her shots may receive a recommendation for a new pair of soccer cleats while a basketball player trying to improve his jumping ability may receive a recommendation for a new pair of basketball shoes. These recommendations may ultimately be based on data derived from monitoring the individuals body and or from monitoring the individual s athletic equipment . For example a source of inadequate performance may be the individual s performance or it may be that the individual s current equipment has worn out. In some embodiments the individual may be provided with the option to purchase the new product at the time of receiving the any training or coaching provided.

In one embodiment the activity metric or specific athletic movement data and or any training or coaching provided may be used for the online customization of certain products. For example this data can be used to customize an article of footwear an article of compression clothing a helmet or other piece of clothing or athletic equipment to enable toe clothing or other equipment to help the individual in improving their future performance. In some embodiments customized products may have an individual styles varied materials or different accessories for the individual to choose from.

In some embodiments certain products or product lines may be unlocked for individuals to purchase only after the individual achieve certain milestones for performance or improvement such as certain levels of an activity metric or certain mastery of a specific athletic movement.

In some embodiments as noted above sensor module of monitoring system can be mounted in an object which can be a piece of athletic equipment such as for example ball . In some embodiments multiple sensor modules can be mounted in ball e.g. one sensor module having axes at one or more oblique angles to another sensor module . Ball may be any ball such as for example a ball typically used in an athletic activity such as for example a soccer ball a basketball a baseball an American football a rugby ball a tennis ball a table tennis ball a bowling ball a golf ball a billiards ball a croquet ball a marble a tetherball or a beach ball. Monitoring system including sensor module mounted to ball is referred to as monitoring system . Sensor module can be mounted to ball using any suitable technique. For example sensor module may be affixed to an exterior or interior surface of ball may be mounted within ball using a harness system e.g. suspended away from an inner wall of ball for example at the center of ball or may be embedded in a material of ball . Exemplary techniques that can be employed to mount sensor module to ball are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7 740 551 filed Nov. 18 2009 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.

In some embodiments sensor module can be activated i.e. enter an active state in response to sensing an activation motion of ball . In some embodiments the activation motion may be for example motion in response to a kick of ball e.g. an acceleration impulse sensed above a threshold or a drop in sensed acceleration to near zero . In some embodiments the activation motion may be for example a kick of throw resulting in travel by ball of at least a threshold distance or height e.g. 2 meters e.g. an acceleration sensed to correspond to such motion . In some embodiments the activation motion may be for example a sequence of motions e.g. motion in response to a kick of ball followed by travel by ball of at least a threshold distance or height . Upon activation sensor module begins to store e.g. in memory and or transfer sensed data to a remote device as described herein. In some embodiments in an active state sensor module may continuously sense data e.g. acceleration data data representative of acceleration is determined by acceleration sensor of sensor module and magnetic field data data representative of a magnetic field is determined by magnetic field sensor of sensor module . In some embodiments data is sensed by sensor module periodically e.g. every 50 milliseconds ms every 10 ms every 1 ms .

In some embodiments sensor module can be deactivated e.g. enter a low power standby state detecting acceleration at a low frequency relative to the active state in response to sensing no motion of sensor module for a predetermined period of time e.g. 30 minutes . In some embodiments sensor module can be deactivated in response to sensing a deactivation motion of ball . In some embodiments the deactivation motion may be for example any of the motions described above as an activation motion. In some embodiments a deactivation motion may be the same as an activation motion. In some embodiments a deactivation motion may be different from an activation motion.

In some embodiments data sensed by sensor module may be time correlated e.g. stored in association with time data representing the time at which the data was sensed . The time at which data is sensed can be provided via timer . In operation sensor module of monitoring system senses and processes signals as described herein to output representations of activity metrics of ball . In some embodiments representations of activity metrics can be output to for example a display device e.g. a display of personal computer portable electronic device or sensor module .

Sensor module can be powered by any suitable technique including those described herein. For example sensor module can be powered by charging via a charging base see e.g. . For example power source of sensor module may be powered by inductive charging in which case an inductive coil may be mounted in ball and coupled to power source of sensor module . In some embodiments the inductive coil may receive power from an inductive charging device e.g. charging base when ball is placed so that the inductive coil is sufficiently close to an inductive coil charging device. In some embodiments ball has exterior markings e.g. marking to indicate the location of the inductive coil to facilitate optimum orientation of ball i.e. the orientation having the inductive coil closest to the inductive coil charging device . In some embodiments sensor module is coupled to a visual indicator such as for example an externally visible light emitting diode LED that gives an indication e.g. LED emits light light emitted by LED changes color speed of LED blinking changes of the strength of charge being received through the inductive coil to facilitate optimum orientation of ball .

In some embodiments monitoring system including sensor module mounted in ball can be used to determine a variety of activity metrics about ball and or an individual interacting with ball including characteristics relating to motion of ball . For example monitoring system can be used to determine trajectory of ball launch angle of ball rotation rate of ball orientation of rotation plane of ball orientation of rotation axis of ball travel speed of ball launch speed of ball force of a kick or other impact on ball distance of travel of ball and maximum acceleration of ball . Monitoring system can perform operations as described herein to determine such activity metrics using any suitable components. For example sensing operations as described may be carried out by a sensor of sensor module of monitoring system e.g. acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor as appropriate . Also for example operations involving processing of data e.g. identifying determining calculating storing may be carried out by processor of sensor module or by a processor of any other device of or in communication with monitoring system e.g. server personal computer or portable electronic device .

In some embodiments calibration data is sensed by sensor module when ball is in a calibration state. In some embodiments ball is in a calibration state when ball is stationary e.g. with respect to an external coordinate system i.e. a coordinate system independent of sensor module such as for example coordinate system depicted in for a period of time e.g. 10 ms or longer . In some embodiments ball can be considered stationary when sensor module of ball senses resultant acceleration of about 1 G i.e. resultant acceleration within a threshold tolerance of 1 G for example within 5 of 1 G . In some embodiments ball can be considered stationary at times while being handled by an individual. For example ball can be stationary for a period of time within a period of time in which a basketball player takes a jump shot with ball e.g. before release of ball from the hands of the individual ball can be considered stationary where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G . Also for example ball can be stationary for a period of time within a period of time in which a baseball player performs a throw of ball e.g. a period of time spanning the transition from rearward motion to forward motion of the individual s throwing motion where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G .

Ball including sensor module is depicted in the calibration state at time too in . Ball may be in the calibration state at any point relative to an athletic activity e.g. before during or after an athletic activity . In some embodiments ball is determined to be in a calibration state and calibration data can be sensed each time ball is stationary for more than a threshold duration e.g. 1 second . In some embodiments ball is determined to be in a calibration state and calibration data can be sensed each time ball is stationary.

In some embodiments in the calibration state acceleration sensor of sensor module senses acceleration data. In some embodiments magnetic field sensor of sensor module senses magnetic field data e.g. data relating to the magnetic field of the Earth . In some embodiments calibration data includes both acceleration data and magnetic field data. In some embodiments calibration data includes one of acceleration data and magnetic field data.

In some embodiments in the calibration state the acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module is acceleration due to gravity which can be used by monitoring system to determine one or both of orientation of acceleration due to gravity with respect to sensor module and magnitude of acceleration due to gravity at sensor module together gravity vector .

In some embodiments in the calibration state magnetic field sensor of sensor module senses one or both of orientation of a magnetic field with respect to sensor module and magnitude of the magnetic field at sensor module together magnetic field vector .

In some embodiments sensor module senses calibration data that is to be relied upon for one or more subsequent calculations. In some embodiments the calibration data sensed when sensor module is in the calibration state can be used to establish external coordinate system . In some embodiments external coordinate system can be established by reference to the orientation of gravity vector e.g. to establish the direction of down since gravity is known to cause downward acceleration . In some embodiments external coordinate system can be established by reference to the orientation of magnetic field vector e.g. to establish a constant reference direction since the magnetic field will typically be appreciably constant over the area of a typical play area for an athletic activity . In some embodiments external coordinate system can be established by reference to the orientation of gravity vector and the orientation of magnetic field vector .

During motion of ball e.g. after ball is kicked or hit ball may move in any or all of six degrees of freedom three linear degrees 1 up down e.g. along the Y axis in external coordinate system 2 left right e.g. along the X axis in external coordinate system and 3 backward forward e.g. along the Z axis in external coordinate system and three rotational degrees 1 yaw e.g. in the angular direction in external coordinate system 2 roll e.g. in the angular direction in external coordinate system and 3 pitch e.g. in the angular direction in external coordinate system .

Individual or other person may desire to know activity metrics of ball for example to learn the effects that actions of individual have on ball e.g. a kick or throw of ball by individual . Monitoring system may determine such activity metrics e.g. trajectory of ball launch angle of ball rotation rate of ball orientation of rotation plane of ball orientation of rotation axis of ball travel speed of ball launch speed of ball force of a kick or other impact on ball distance of travel of ball and maximum acceleration of ball . Sensor module may output data representative of such activity metrics e.g. to a display device of personal computer or portable electronic device . Such data may be outputted from sensor module in raw form e.g. unprocessed signals from acceleration sensor and or magnetic field sensor or in representative form e.g. data that results from processing signals from acceleration sensor and or magnetic field sensor . In some embodiments monitoring system outputs a representation of one or more activity metrics in a manner perceivable by individual and or other person.

Data representative of such activity metrics can be processed and or output in any suitable manner such as for example those described herein.

As noted herein in some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of instantaneous trajectory of ball over a period of time or at a particular point in time the instantaneous trajectory being a representation of the direction of motion of ball in motion . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of launch angle of ball . In some embodiments launch angle can be determined to correspond to instantaneous trajectory of ball at a point in time sufficiently close to initiation of motion of ball e.g. shortly after ball has been kicked or hit . In some embodiments initiation of motion of ball is determined based on a sensed impulse acceleration exceeding a threshold. In some embodiments launch angle can be determined to correspond to instantaneous trajectory of ball less than 150 ms e.g. 100 ms to 150 ms after initiation of motion of ball . In some embodiments launch angle can be determined to correspond to instantaneous trajectory of ball at the earliest time after initiation of motion of ball at which acceleration magnitude can be sensed. In some embodiments this time may immediately follow a period of less reliable data output by acceleration sensor where such data output is less reliable than data output by acceleration sensor at other times . Such less reliable data output may be the result of for example a disturbance e.g. railing in sensed acceleration data e.g. due to sudden change in acceleration for example upon an impact or gain saturation of the acceleration sensor signal e.g. a period during which the acceleration sensor outputs its maximum acceleration signal because acceleration is higher than the maximum acceleration it can sense which may result from for example the high initial acceleration of ball in reaction to an impact e.g. a kick a throw a shot . In some embodiments such less reliable acceleration data output may be experienced for a time e.g. 100 150 ms after impact of a kick e.g. about 10 ms for the duration of kick impact and about 90 ms to 140 ms after impact .

Launch angle can correspond to instantaneous trajectory as the angle of the vertical component of the direction of travel of ball in free flight sufficiently close to initiation of motion of ball . In some embodiments free flight is determined based on acceleration data. Immediately upon entering free flight e.g. upon ball being thrown or kicked acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor shows resultant acceleration of less than 1 G i.e. less than the acceleration due to gravity . For example resultant acceleration may drop from 1 G e.g. in a stationary or non free flight state to 0.5 G e.g. in free flight . The time at which this drop takes place can be determined as the initiation of free flight. Continued free flight can be determined while resultant acceleration remains below 1 G. In some embodiments the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity can be predefined or can be determined based on acceleration data sensed while ball is stationary e.g. in a calibration state .

The closer to initiation of motion that the angle of the vertical component of the direction of travel of ball in free flight is determined the more representative of launch angle it may be. Beyond initiation of motion the angle of the vertical component of the direction of travel of ball in free flight may change e.g. decrease . In some embodiments this change can be compensated for using a formula based on the instantaneous trajectory speed see below and time after initiation of motion to increase the accuracy of the launch angle determination. In some embodiments the path of ball during a period of gain saturation i.e. while the acceleration sensor is railed can be determined based on magnetic field data sensed during that time. In some embodiments the launch angle at the moment of impact can be determined based on this path.

In some embodiments instantaneous trajectory and or launch angle of ball can be determined based on one or more of acceleration data and magnetic field data e.g. sensed by acceleration sensor and or magnetic field sensor at a first earlier time and one or more of acceleration data and magnetic field data e.g. sensed by acceleration sensor and magnetic field sensor at a second later time. In some embodiments at the first time ball is stationary e.g. in a calibration state and at the second time ball is in motion e.g. motion of ball is initiated between the first time and the second time .

In some embodiments for example as shown in an external coordinate system e.g. external coordinate system is determined at a first time see e.g. operation where ball is in a calibration state at the first time. In some embodiments the orientation of an internal coordinate system fixed with reference to sensor module e.g. internal coordinate system is determined relative to external coordinate system see e.g. operation . For ease of description internal coordinate system is described herein to align with external coordinate system at the first time but it should be understood that internal coordinate system need not align with external coordinate system e.g. internal coordinate system may be established by an angular offset from external coordinate system and that internal coordinate system need not be characterized by traditional coordinate components but may be characterized simply by some reference establishing the relative orientation of sensor module with respect to the external coordinate system e.g. external coordinate system . Components of internal coordinate system are designated in the figures as X e.g. left right Y e.g. up down Z e.g. backward forward e.g. yaw e.g. roll and e.g. pitch and changes in the coordinate components are designated as X Y Z and respectively see e.g. .

For example as depicted in in some embodiments acceleration sensor is used to determine the orientation of gravity vector with respect to sensor module i.e. with respect to internal coordinate system at the first time see e.g. operation and in some embodiments magnetic field sensor is used to determine the orientation of magnetic field vector with respect to sensor module at the first time see e.g. operation . In some embodiments the orientation of internal coordinate system with respect to external coordinate system can be determined based on one or both of gravity vector and magnetic field vector see e.g. operation . In this way an initial orientation of ball can be determined based on the initial orientation of sensor module including internal coordinate system within external coordinate system .

In some embodiments for example see rotation e.g. three dimensional rotation of ball is sensed and measured between the first time and a second time see e.g. operation where ball is in motion at the second time e.g. shortly after motion is initiated such as for example 100 ms after motion is detected . In some embodiments such rotation can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations.

For example in some embodiments the change in orientation of ball between the first time and the second time is determined based on magnetic field data sensed by magnetic field sensor from the first time to the second time. For example the change in orientation of ball between the first time and the second time may be expressed by the angular difference of axes X Y and Z between the first time and the second time with respect to external coordinate system depicted as and .

Also for example in some embodiments the change in position of ball between the first time and the second time can be determined based on acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor and or magnetic field data sensed by magnetic field sensor from the first time to the second time. In some embodiments such change in position can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations.

For example the change in position of ball between the first time and the second time may be expressed by the linear difference in position of sensor module along of axes X Y and Z between the first time and the second time with respect to external coordinate system depicted as X Y and Z .

In some embodiments at the second time acceleration sensor of sensor module senses one or both of orientation of acceleration i.e. the acceleration direction of sensor module and thus ball with respect to sensor and magnitude of acceleration of sensor module together a resultant acceleration vector see e.g. operation . In some embodiments the acceleration sensed by sensor module is substantially entirely due to the effects of drag i.e. deceleration due to a drag force on ball . In some embodiments acceleration sensor is an inertial system and thus does not sense acceleration due to gravity when in free flight. 

It is known that the direction of motion of a moving body is opposite to the direction of drag force applied to the moving body. In some embodiments monitoring system determines the relative i.e. with respect to sensor module direction of motion of ball to be opposite to the direction of resultant acceleration vector see e.g. operation .

In some embodiments to determine the absolute i.e. with respect to the external coordinate system direction of motion of ball e.g. instantaneous trajectory monitoring system subtracts the angle of rotation of ball between the first time and the second time from the relative direction of motion of ball see e.g. operation .

In some embodiments to determine launch angle of ball monitoring system determines the angle of the vertical component of the absolute direction of motion of ball which is determined to correspond to launch angle of ball see e.g. operation .

As noted herein in some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of rotation rate of ball see e.g. . Rotation rate is a measure of the angular velocity o at which ball rotates and can be expressed for example as the number of revolutions of ball per unit time or the angular change of ball per unit time. In some embodiments rotation rate can be determined based on magnetic field data sensed by magnetic field sensor .

In some embodiments to determine rotation rate of ball sensor module of rotating ball can sense magnetic field data via magnetic field sensor for a period of time see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can apply a Fourier transform to the sensed magnetic field data a time domain representation . This results in a representation of the frequency of rotation of ball a frequency domain representation that is a representation of its rotation rate see e.g. operation .

In some embodiments to determine rotation rate of ball sensor module of rotating ball can sense acceleration data via acceleration sensor at a first time e.g. t see and at a second time e.g. t see . Between the first time and the second time ball including sensor module rotates. Acceleration data sensed at the first time and the second time is a resultant acceleration vector created due to drag forces acting on ball . In some embodiments monitoring system normalizes the resultant acceleration vector at each of the first time and the second time e.g. so that the resultant acceleration vector is between 1 and 1 . Such normalization can provide a true orientation in space of the resultant acceleration vector. This normalization is performed on data from all e.g. all three axes of acceleration sensor such that the sum of the squares of the normalized values will always be 1 . In some embodiments monitoring system determines the angle of each axis at the first time and at the second time by denormalizing the magnitude of the normalized value e.g. calculating the cosine or arccosine of the value . In some embodiments monitoring system determines the change in each angle between the first time and the second time. In some embodiments monitoring system determines the rate of rotation based on the change in angle between the first time and the second time and the elapsed time between the first time and the second time.

In some embodiments to determine rotation rate of ball sensor module of rotating ball can sense acceleration data via acceleration sensor for a period of time see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can identify a repeating portion of the sensed acceleration data e.g. the orientation of acceleration with respect to sensor module see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can identify a repeating portion of the sensed acceleration data by identifying successive similar orientations of such acceleration data e.g. repeating peaks in data output representative of the orientation of acceleration with respect to sensor module see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine the time period of a repeating portion of sensed acceleration data e.g. the elapsed time between successive similar orientations of such acceleration data which can represent the time period for a single revolution of ball see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can calculate the inverse of the time period for a single revolution of ball see e.g. operation and can determine this value to be the rotation rate of ball see e.g. operation .

As described above monitoring system can determine rotation rate of ball using magnetic field data alone or acceleration data alone. In some embodiments monitoring system can separately determine rotation rate of ball using both acceleration data and magnetic field data. In some embodiments monitoring system can determine rotation rate of ball using acceleration data where magnetic field data is unreliable e.g. due to interference or other perturbation or vice versa.

As noted herein in some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of the orientation of rotation of ball which may be represented the angle e.g. having components of the axis of rotation of ball and or the angle e.g. having components of the plane of rotation of ball see e.g. . Axis of rotation is an axis through ball about which ball rotates. Plane of rotation is a plane orthogonal to axis of rotation . Angles can be expressed with respect to external coordinate system . In some embodiments angles can be determined based on acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor and magnetic field data sensed by magnetic field sensor .

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine one or both of angles by sensing orientation of resultant acceleration vector with respect to sensor module at a first time e.g. t see e.g. operation and at a second time e.g. t where the second time may be 20 30 ms after the first time see e.g. operation . See for example wherein arrows show the direction of rotation of ball . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine the orientation with respect to sensor module of the plane defined between the orientation of resultant acceleration vector with respect to ball at the first time and the orientation of resultant acceleration vector with respect to ball at the second time see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can define this plane to be the plane of rotation of ball see e.g. see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine the angle between plane of rotation and the orientation of gravity vector with respect to sensor module determined for example as described herein see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system can calculate angles based on the angle between plane of rotation and the orientation of gravity vector using for example trigonometric calculations see e.g. operation .

As noted herein in some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of travel speed of ball . Speed is a measure of the rate of change of the position of ball and can be expressed as the magnitude of a velocity vector of ball see e.g. . Speed of ball can be determined based on acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor while ball is in motion. Speed of ball can be determined for any time ball is in free flight. In some embodiments speed is calculated shortly after initiation of motion e.g. 50 ms after being kicked in order to determine a near maximum speed of ball in response to the initiation of motion.

In some embodiments ball is determined to be in free flight at a given time see e.g. operation . While in free flight acceleration sensor of sensor module may sense magnitude of acceleration of sensor module and thus ball with respect to sensor module see e.g. operation . The magnitude of acceleration can be expressed as the magnitude of a resultant acceleration vector see e.g. . In some embodiments the acceleration sensed by sensor module is substantially entirely due to the effects of drag i.e. deceleration due to a drag force on ball .

It is known that the direction of motion of a moving body is opposite to the direction of drag force applied to the moving body. Thus in some embodiments the magnitude of acceleration sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module is the magnitude of acceleration in the direction of motion of ball . In some embodiments the magnitude of acceleration sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module is determined to be the magnitude of acceleration in the direction of motion of ball see e.g. operation .

Speed of ball in motion can be expressed as a function of the magnitude of acceleration of ball . This functional relationship can be influenced by physical characteristics of ball e.g. mass size surface area surface texture material shape panel shape moment of inertia and thus may vary for balls of different construction. This functional relationship can also be influenced by environmental conditions e.g. ambient temperature local pressure indications of which may be received by monitoring system from suitable environmental sensors e.g. coupled to ball incorporated into sensor module coupled to a remote device or input by a user e.g. individual via an interface of monitoring system e.g. an input of personal computer or portable electronic device such as for example a keyboard microphone or touchscreen . This functional relationship can also be influenced by dynamic characteristics of ball such as for example rotation of ball e.g. rotation rate and or rotation angle which can impart a Magnus effect on ball influencing its speed a Magnus effect can cause a curve or bend in the trajectory of ball .

For a given ball and balls of the same or sufficiently similar construction this functional relationship may be established by calculation e.g. the relation between drag force and speed of a spherical object in free flight is speed constant log drag constant experimentation or both and may be expressed and or stored as a data structure within monitoring system for example as an algorithm e.g. f acceleration speed as a graphical curve e.g. curve or as a lookup table e.g. table .

In some embodiments the functional relationship can be established or augmented by a user e.g. individual of ball . For example individual may set ball on the ground a distance from a wall or other object or structure . Individual may input the distance into monitoring system via an interface thereof. Individual may then kick ball at the wall. Sensor module may sense the time of initiation of free flight of ball as ball is impacted by individual s foot. Sensor module may then sense the time ball makes contact with the wall e.g. by an abrupt change e.g. a drop to about zero in resultant acceleration . The distance traveled divided by the time of travel can be used to determine a representation of the speed of ball for the measured kick. Resultant acceleration i.e. drag can be sensed for the measured kick . Individual may perform such operations multiple times at the same or different distances to establish an experimental data set which can be used to derive a representation of the functional relationship between drag force and speed of the ball in free flight. This representation of the functional relationship can be stored as a data structure within monitoring system and subsequently referred to in order to determine speed of ball based on measured acceleration data as described above .

Once the magnitude of acceleration of ball is sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module monitoring system compares the magnitude of acceleration of ball to a data structure expressing the functional relationship between magnitude of acceleration and speed for the given ball see e.g. operation to determine speed of ball i.e. the speed that corresponds to the sensed acceleration magnitude in the data structure expressing the functional relationship see e.g. operation .

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of a flight time of ball . In some embodiments flight time can be determined based on acceleration data. For example flight time can correspond to a period during which acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor shows resultant acceleration of less than 1 G. For example sensor module may determine the time at which ball enters free flight e.g. monitoring system may determine a flight initiation time corresponding to the time at which resultant acceleration drops below 1 G may determine a flight termination time corresponding to the time at which resultant acceleration returns to 1 G may calculate the elapsed time between the flight initiation time and the flight termination time and may determine the elapsed time to be a flight time of ball .

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of distance of travel of ball . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine distance of travel of ball for a flight of ball based on acceleration data. In some embodiments monitoring system can determine distance of travel based on flight time of ball which can be determined as described above and travel speed of ball which can be determined as described above during the flight time e.g. monitoring system can determine the average speed of ball during flight . For example monitoring system can determine distance of travel for a flight of ball by multiplying average velocity during the flight by the flight time.

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine a trajectory model i.e. path of flight for an instance of free flight of ball and may calculate the distance traversed by ball . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine the trajectory model based on conditions e.g. activity metrics of ball e.g. conditions at initiation of flight of ball and or at a point in time thereafter . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine the trajectory model based on speed of ball launch angle of ball rotation plane of ball and rotation rate of ball each of which can be determined for example as described herein. Monitoring system can calculate the distance traveled by ball based on the trajectory model e.g. by calculating the distance between beginning and end points of the trajectory model along the ground or a plane representing the ground . In some embodiments because the trajectory model can be determined based on conditions before completion of a flight of ball monitoring system can determine a trajectory model for an instance of flight even in the event that free flight of ball is interrupted e.g. by striking an object . In such a case monitoring system can determine an estimated distance traveled by ball which can correspond to a distance ball would have traveled had its flight not been interrupted.

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and or output a representation of maximum acceleration of ball . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine maximum acceleration of ball based on acceleration data. For example monitoring system can determine maximum acceleration of ball in flight using acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module . Whether ball is in flight can be determined as described above. For example monitoring system can compare the magnitude of acceleration of ball for a time period at all times during the period or a subset thereof for which data is available to identify the greatest magnitude of acceleration which can be determined to be the maximum acceleration of ball during the time period. The time period for which maximum acceleration is determined can be any time period for example a single period of free flight a selected time period or the duration of an athletic contest. In some embodiments monitoring system is may filter out sensed magnitudes of acceleration of around or in excess of 1 G as such magnitudes may be due to gravity e.g. in the event ball is not in free flight .

Monitoring system can output representations of activity metrics including for example trajectory of ball launch angle of ball rotation rate of ball orientation of rotation plane of ball orientation of rotation axis of ball travel speed of ball launch speed of ball force of a kick or other impact on ball distance of travel of ball and maximum acceleration of ball in a manner perceivable by individual or other person e.g. a coach trainer or spectator . Data generated within or received by any component of monitoring system can be transmitted processed and output in any suitable manner including those described herein.

For example in some embodiments representations of activity metrics can be output to a display of a portable electronic device e.g. portable electronic device or personal computer e.g. personal computer . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and output for example representations of activity metrics in real time representations of past activity metrics representations of predicted activity metrics representations of comparisons of a current or most recent value for an activity metric to a past value for that activity metric representations of comparisons of one activity metric to a different activity metric representations of comparisons of a value for an activity metric to a target value for the activity metric representations of comparisons of a value for an activity metric of ball or individual to a value for the same or a different activity metric for a different ball or individual.

In some embodiments representations of activity metrics can be presented e.g. displayed on a display screen of any of the devices described herein as functions of one another or of other variables. For example travel distance of ball can be presented as a function of launch angle. Also for example activity metrics can be presented as a function of location e.g. location on a playing field proximity to a player proximity to a goal as a function of an event e.g. scoring of a field goal committing a foul as a function of an environmental condition e.g. ambient temperature precipitation or as a function of a physiological condition of an individual e.g. heart rate body temperature . Information relating to such variables e.g. location information event information environmental condition information and physiological condition information may be provided to monitoring system from appropriate sensors incorporated therein or from elements outside of monitoring system that are in communication with monitoring system .

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and output representations in any perceivable way for example numerically e.g. by outputting a value indicative of the activity metric or comparison textually e.g. by outputting a word or phrase indicative of the activity metric or comparison graphically e.g. by outputting a graph or other image indicative of the activity metric or comparison or tabularly e.g. by outputting a table indicative of the activity metric or comparison .

In some embodiments activity metrics can be output in a game like manner. Points or other positive or negative feedback may be determined and output based on values for activity metrics for ball and or individual . Comparisons based on such values or feedback can influence progress in the game. For example such values or feedback may be compared to past values or feedback for the same individual or ball and improvement may result in positive progress being made in the game e.g. a higher level being designated to a game account of individual or ball . Also for example such values or feedback may be compared to values or feedback of a different individual or ball including data of or purported to be of a professional athlete or other well known individual and progress in the game may be determined based on that comparison. Also for example such values or feedback may be compared to target values or feedback and progress in the game may be determined based on that comparison. Also for example in some embodiments such activity metrics can govern capabilities of a virtual player in a virtual game by being uploaded to or otherwise accessed by the game e.g. the maximum ball speed of an individual s kick of ball may limit the maximum virtual ball speed of a virtual avatar of the individual in a virtual game .

In some embodiments monitoring system can be used as a standalone monitoring system. In some embodiments however monitoring system or components thereof can be used in conjunction with or incorporated into other monitoring systems including for example those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 077 494 filed Mar. 31 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

For example in some embodiments any of the activity metrics including values and or outputs described herein can be used and or output in conjunction with activity metrics or other data from other monitoring systems for example monitoring devices and associated components that sense characteristics e.g. movement performance and or physiological characteristics of one or more objects or players engaged in an athletic activity such as described above for example with respect to the group monitoring system . For example an individual engaged in an athletic activity may be separately monitored by a monitoring device such that activity metrics of the individual s performance can be monitored and or output for observation by for example a coach trainer or spectator or for later review by the individual himself. Simultaneously activity metrics of ball which can be interacted with by the individual during the athletic activity may be monitored and or output as described herein with reference to monitoring system . The activity metrics resulting from monitoring of ball can be used together with the activity metrics resulting from monitoring of the individual. For example activity metrics derived from the individual can be displayed in a time correlated manner with activity metrics derived from ball . Also for example activity metrics derived from the individual can be expressed as a function of activity metrics derived from ball or vice versa . Also for example new activity metrics can be determined based on analysis of both activity metrics derived from the individual and activity metrics derived from ball e.g. the time it takes for the individual to react to an instruction to kick ball .

For example an individual s speed may be monitored during performance of an athletic activity and speed of ball may also be monitored during performance of the athletic activity. A monitoring system taking both of these characteristics into account may display or otherwise output speed of the individual in conjunction with the speed of ball see e.g. . For a series of kicks maximum speed of ball may be expressed as a function of speed of the individual. Similar comparison combinations and or representations can be provided for any other combination of characteristics derived from outputs of ball and a monitored individual.

In some embodiments a plurality of monitored individuals may interact with one or more of ball e.g. during a soccer game . Activity metrics derived from each of the plurality of individuals and activity metrics derived from ball s can be similarly compared combined and or represented as described above. Such comparison combination and or representations can be made based on each individual considered separately on a subset of individuals grouped together e.g. a team midfielders of a team or on all monitored individuals. In a game setting such comparison combination and or representations can be correlated to game events such as a goal a ball traveling out of bounds a penalty kick or a jump ball which can be output in relation to contemporaneous activity metrics of individuals as described.

Such comparing combining and or representing data derived from monitoring ball and from monitoring individuals interacting with ball can provide benefits to for example the individuals participating in an athletic activity coaches spectators physicians and game officials. Such persons may interact or work together during a session of athletic activity for a variety of reasons.

For example it may be desired that a coach monitors the performance of the individuals and makes recommendations or otherwise influences their performance in order to maximize the individuals fitness level. Alternatively or additionally it may be desired that the coach monitors and influences the individuals to help maximize the effectiveness of the individuals in the athletic activity. Further it may be desired that the coach monitors and influences the individuals to help maximize the probability of success in the athletic activity where success may be for example defeating an opposing team in a game such as for example soccer or achieving maintaining a desired level of fitness for one or more individuals participating in the athletic activity . A session of athletic activity may include for example a training session e.g. a field session a gym session a track session or a competitive session e.g. a soccer match or a basketball game .

In some embodiments the coach may monitor the individuals and ball and may provide feedback to the individuals in order to track and maintain or improve the individuals health safety and or performance.

The coach must consider these and other goals monitor the individuals activity including the results of their activity e.g. as determined through monitoring of ball and make decisions to influence the performance of the individuals both individually and as a group. In doing so the coach depends on information about the individuals and their performance while participating in a session of athletic activity. A monitoring system e.g. monitoring system group monitoring system that provides data about the individuals as well as a ball being interacted with by the individuals can provide the coach with easy to understand information about individuals participating in the athletic activity beyond that which can be directly observed thereby facilitating quick and effective decision making by the coach to maximize the probability of achieving success in the athletic activity.

For example sensor module coupled to ball and sensor modules coupled to other balls objects or individuals may monitor activity e.g. activity metrics of ball and other balls objects or individuals and may send data relating to the monitored activity to a display device e.g. group monitoring device see e.g. which may display a representation of the activity for viewing by the coach. In some embodiments such data may be sent from sensor modules to base station and from base station to group monitoring device . In some embodiments such data may be sent from sensor modules to base station and from base station to group monitoring device . In some embodiments such data may be sent directly from sensor modules and or portable electronic devices in the case where portable electronic devices receive such data from sensor modules to group monitoring device . In some embodiments such data may be sent from sensor modules and or portable electronic devices in the case where portable electronic devices receive such data from sensor modules to other sensor modules or other portable electronic devices and thereafter output for display on a display device e.g. via group monitoring device and or portable electronic device 

As noted herein any processing of such data e.g. as described herein between generation thereof and output e.g. display thereof can be performed by a processor of any element that receives such data in any form including for example sensor module portable electronic device base station and group monitoring device as shown for example in .
