Optical sensor systems may be used to identify objects within a physical environment and to track those objects as they move throughout the physical environment. Optical tracking of a human subject may be used to control an electronic device such as a computer or a gaming device. As one such example a human subject may provide a control input to an electronic device by moving his or her body within a scene observed by one or more optical sensors.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

Physical movement of a human subject may be guided by a visual cue. A physical environment is observed to identify a current position of a body portion of the human subject. A model path of travel is obtained for the body portion of the human subject. A visual cue that indicates the model path of travel for the body portion is projected onto the human subject and or into a field of view of the human subject.

A visual cue may be projected onto a human subject and or into a field of view of the human subject to guide physical movement. The visual cue may enable a human subject to achieve greater accuracy or improved technique with respect to the physical movement than may otherwise be achieved without the visual cue. Physical movements that are guided by the visual cue may be applicable to controlling an electronic device performing a physical exercise or task engaging in a form of physical therapy or other suitable endeavor.

The use of visual cues for guiding physical movement has virtually limitless applications. For example a novice musician learning to play an instrument may be directed to a correct posture by a visual cue when their form begins to drift. An amateur athlete working on punching exercises during martial arts training may be guided toward the proper form or style by a visual cue. Physical therapy patients recovering from an injury may be guided through their exercises by a visual cue.

Visual cue may be used to guide the body portion of the human subject toward or along model path of travel . For example visual cue may include a directional indicator e.g. an arrow that guides the body portion toward model path of travel . It will be understood that visual cue is merely one non limiting example of a visual cue as other types of visual cues may be used. Physical movement of body portion along a path of travel may at times deviate from a model path of travel as indicated by example deviation .

In the position of body portion and or other body portions of the human subject may be identified by observing the physical environment. As a nonlimiting example the physical environment may be imaged via one or more optical sensors such as optical sensors and or . In at least some implementations one or more optical sensors and or one or more image projectors may be contained within or may form part of a common device. For example in image projector and optical sensor form part of a common peripheral device . Peripheral device may be operatively connected to one or more other electronic devices such as a computer gaming device or other suitable device. It will be understood that optical imaging need not be used in all embodiments. In some embodiments observation of the physical environment may be performed electromagnetically via inertial measurements e.g. using worn trackers or using other suitable approaches.

Within use environment visual information may be presented to the human subject via a graphical display . Peripheral device may reside for example at a location that is near graphical display . However in at least some implementations one or more optical sensors and or one or more image projectors may reside at a different location from one or more other optical sensors and or image projectors. For example in image projector and optical sensor are located above e.g. overhead of the human subject. It will be understood that any suitable number of image projectors and or optical sensors may be located at any suitable location relative to a human subject.

In at least some implementations one or more optical sensors and or one or more image projectors may reside at or form part of a device that is worn by or held by the human subject. As one example an optical sensor and or an image projector may be integrated into a pair of glasses that are worn by the human subject. As another example an optical sensor and or image projector may be integrated into a hand held mobile device.

In at least some implementation the head of a human subject can be tracked and the shape of the visual cue can be augmented in accordance with the orientation of the head. For example if the user changes head position a 3D arrow visual cue pointing upwards can be augmented to take into account the new head position to create the correct perspective view e.g. the 3D arrow is adjusted such that it always looks like it is pointed upwards regardless of the position of the human subject s head .

At the method may include imaging or otherwise observing a physical environment to identify a current position of one or more body portions of a human subject. Any suitable observation technique may be used to identify the current position of the human subject or the subject s one or more body portions that are present within an imaged scene. As a non limiting example a physical environment may be imaged via one or more optical sensors that include a depth camera to identify a three dimensional position e.g. x position y position and z position of objects within the imaged scene. Further aspects of these and other imaging techniques will be described in greater detail with reference to .

Observing a physical environment may be performed over a period of time to capture transient aspects of physical objects. For example a current position of one or more body portions of a human subject may be updated over time as those body portions move within the physical environment. A change in position of a body portion that occurs between two or more instances in time may define a path of travel for that body portion in one two or three dimensional space.

At the method may include obtaining a model path of travel for the body portion of the human subject. A model path of travel may be obtained by programmatically generating the model path of travel or by receiving a pre defined model path of travel from a data source. As one example the data source may include or may be defined by an application program that includes one or more pre defined model paths of travel. As another example a human subject may record or otherwise define a model path of travel by moving within an observed scene.

A model path of travel may be defined by a series of two or more points in dimensional space with each point represented by one or more coordinate values e.g. x y and z coordinate values defining the location of that point. In at least some implementations each point may be associated with an order value that indicates a relative order of that point within the series of points. The order value may indicate a time value for each of the one or more points for example if the model path of travel defines a timing of movement along the model path of travel. As another example a relative order of points defining a model path of travel may be indicated by segments that link two respective points of the series. As yet another example a relative order of points defining a model path of travel may be indicated by their respective order within a list of points.

A model path of travel may be a one dimensional or multi dimensional model path of travel. A one dimensional model path of travel includes one spatial dimension that defines motion along a straight line. A multi dimensional model path of travel may include two spatial dimensions that defines motion along a non straight line within a plane three spatial dimensions that defines motion along a non straight line in multiple planes a time dimension and one spatial dimension or a time dimension and two or more spatial dimensions. Examples of higher order spatial dimensions may include twisting or rotation of body portions of the human subject that may form part of a model path of travel in addition to or as an alternative to translation of the body portion.

If the model path of travel does not include a time dimension a timing of movement of a body portion along the model path of travel may be at the discretion of the human subject. If the model path of travel includes a time dimension the timing of movement of the body portion along the model path of travel may be defined at least in part by the time dimension of that model path of travel including respective time values associated with points along that model path of travel. In such case the human subject may be guided along the model path of travel in accordance with the time dimension and may be provided visual cues to indicate a relationship between the current position of the body portion and a model position along the model path of travel that accords with the time values of the time dimension.

At the method may include projecting a visual cue onto the human subject. The visual cue may indicate the model path of travel for the body portion of the human subject. For example the visual cue may be projected onto the body portion of the human subject or onto a different body portion of the human subject.

By projecting the visual cue onto the body portion that is being guided the human subject may obtain visual feedback e.g. where a user has already moved and or feedforward e.g. where a user is to move next information relating to the model path of travel while that human subject is observing that body portion. Accordingly the human subject is able to focus on the body portion rather than dividing attention between the body portion and a dedicated graphical display device. Furthermore projection of the visual cue onto the human subject or into a field of view of the human subject enables the human subject to face away from a dedicated graphical display device.

If two or more image projectors are available for projecting the visual cue one some or all of those image projectors may be used to project the visual cue. In at least some implementations the physical environment that was imaged at may be used to identify which image projectors are able to project the visual cue onto a target object e.g. a surface of the human subject or other object without occlusion of that projection by another object within the physical environment. Image projectors that are unable to project the visual cue onto the target object without occlusion may not be used to project the visual cue at least temporarily or until occlusion has abated. Image projectors that are able to project the visual cue onto the target object may be used to project the visual cue.

In at least some implementations a spatial parameter e.g. location and or depth of projection of the visual cue may be varied as a body portion moves within the physical environment to maintain projection of the visual cue within a boundary of the body portion. This technique may be referred to as a self guided implementation in which the visual cue tracks the body portion of the human subject as identified from the imaged environment. In this context the human subject may choose the pace at which the body portion follows the visual cues. Aspects of object tracking will be described in greater detail with reference to .

In another implementation the visual cue may instead follow the model path of travel or track a model position along the model path of travel. This technique may be referred to as a system imposed timing implementation of the visual cue in which the human subject attempts to follow the projected visual cue within the physical environment. Hence under the system imposed timing implementation the visual cue may not be projected onto the body portion at all times for example if the body portion is not located at a model position along the model path of travel. However in other examples the visual cue may be maintained on or within the boundaries of the body portion even if the human subject deviates from the model path or model position along the model path. As one example to ensure that visual cues are not projected outside the boundary of the body portion a derivative map of a depth image of the body portion may be computed to check for threshold changes in depth at the boundaries of the body portion. If a visual cue reaches a contour or boundary of the body portion the visual cue may be stopped from moving or slowed along the model path of travel until the human subject has caught up to the visual cue.

Alternatively or additionally the visual cue may be projected into a field of view of the human subject. In at least some implementations the field of view of the human subject may be identified by observing the physical environment as previously described at . For example a field of view of a human subject may be identified or inferred from an orientation of the head of the human subject and or the location of physical objects e.g. walls body portions furniture or other suitable surfaces within the physical environment upon which the visual cue may be projected.

The visual cue may indicate the model path of travel by showing how the human subject s previous physical movements tracked the model path of travel. This type of visual cue may be used to provide visual feedback information to the human subject. Alternatively or additionally the visual cue may indicate the model path of travel by showing how the human subject s future physical movements can mimic the model path of travel. This type of visual cue may be used to provide visual feedforward information to the human subject.

In at least some implementations the visual cue may indicate the model path of travel by showing a deviation between a current position of the body portion and a model position along the model path of travel. For example the method may further include determining a magnitude and or a direction of the deviation between a current position of the body portion and a model position along the model path of travel. The visual cue may indicate the magnitude and or the direction of the deviation. As will be described in greater detail with reference to and a variety of different approaches may be used to guide a human subject toward or along a model path of travel using a visual cue.

A visual cue may take a variety of different forms to provide feedback and or feedforward information to a human subject. shows a series of visual cues that may be used to guide physical movement of a human subject. In a visual cue is projected onto a body portion e.g. a hand at . In visual cue takes the form of a visible light portion having circular shape e.g. a spot . However it will be understood that a visual cue may include any suitable shape icon or form of graphical information.

Visual cue may be used in the context in which a human subject follows the visual cue along the model path of travel. The relative location at which the visual cue is projected within the boundaries of the body portion or other suitable object may indicate a direction e.g. within a first plane that the body portion should be moved to follow the model path of travel. In the illustrated example the visual cues are projected on a hand such that if the user moves his hand so as to center the visual cue on his hand his hand will follow the model path of travel.

For example visual cue is projected onto a right side of the body portion at indicating that the body portion should be moved to the right in a horizontal plane. At another instance visual cue is projected onto a left side of the body portion at indicating that the body portion should be moved to the right in the horizontal plane. At another instance visual cue is projected onto a near side of the body portion at indicating that the body portion should be moved backward or toward the human subject in the horizontal plane. At yet another instance visual cue is projected onto a far side of the body portion at indicating that the body portion should be moved forward or away from the human subject in the horizontal plane.

A visual cue may indicate a model path of travel in a higher level of dimensionality by the inclusion of other graphical information. As a non limiting example visual cue includes a directional indicator e.g. an arrow that directs the human subject to move the body portion in a vertical direction or vertical plane that is perpendicular to the horizontal plane e.g. in an upward direction relative to the horizontal plane . The directional indicator may be orientated to point along the model path of travel or may indicate a travel path guiding the body portion toward a model position along the model path of travel in a coordinate axis or plane associated with the directional indicator.

Visual cue includes another directional indicator e.g. an arrow that is smaller than directional indicator . A size e.g. a length and or width of the directional indicator may be used to indicate a magnitude of a deviation between a current position of the body portion and a model position along a model path of travel at least within the coordinate axis or plane associated with the directional indicator. For example directional indicator may indicate a greater deviation from the model position than directional indicator .

Visual cue includes an icon that may indicate that the current position of the body portion is located along the model path of travel or at a model position along the model path of travel in a coordinate axis or plane associated with the directional indicator. For example icon may indicate that the body portion is at the correct height relative to the horizontal plane as defined by the model path of travel.

Visual cue includes yet another directional indicator e.g. an arrow that is oriented in a different direction than directional indicators and . Directional indicator may be used to inform the human subject that the body portion should be moved in a different direction than indicated by directional indicators and . For example directional indicator may indicate that the body portion is to be moved downward relative to the horizontal plane.

While the example directional indicators of indicate linear paths of travel it will be appreciated that other directional indicators may be used including directional indicators that indicate rotation or curved paths of travel e.g. a clock wise or counter clockwise arrow or other suitable paths of travel.

A visual cue may alternatively or additionally include one or more colors that indicate a relative position of the body portion relative to the model path of travel. The term color as used herein may include reference to one or more of the properties of a color including hue colorfulness chroma saturation lightness and brightness. Accordingly where a visual cue includes a color that visual cue may have a different hue colorfulness chroma saturation lightness and or brightness than the surrounding environment and or other aspects of that visual cue.

A visual cue may include a visual representation of a multi dimensional directional indicator to guide physical movement of the human subject in multi dimensional space. shows an example visual cue taking the form of a three dimensional arrow . Visual cue further includes a virtual shadow for three dimensional arrow . Three dimensional arrow may be oriented to point along the model path of travel or toward a model position along the model path of travel.

A visual cue may alternatively or additionally include a visual representation of the model path of travel and or a current position of the body portion relative to the model path of travel. shows another example visual cue taking the form of a visual representation of a model path of travel . Visual cue further includes a current position of the body portion relative to the model path of travel.

The visual representation of the model path of travel may take the form of a one two or three dimensional model path of travel depending on the dimensionality of that model path. For example if the model path of travel includes multiple spatial dimensions the visual cue may include a visual representation of the multi dimensional model path of travel. As another example if the model path of travel includes a time dimension the visual cue may indicate a deviation between the current position and a model position along the model path of travel. The model position may include a time dependent model position that is registered to a time value associated with a point along the model path. The time value may be measured relative to a time that the movement along the model path of travel was initiated. In at least some implementations visual cue may further include a visual representation of a model position along model path of travel .

The various visual cues described herein may be used alone or in combination to provide an indication of past current and or future position of a body portion. As one example a visual cue may include a visible light portion that indicates a first direction of movement for the body portion toward or along the model path of travel in a first plane and a directional indicator that indicates a second direction of movement for the body portion toward or along the model path of travel in a second direction or plane that is perpendicular to the first plane. As another example the icon based visual cues of or may be overlaid on or may incorporate the color based visual cues of to indicate a direction of movement in two or more perpendicular planes.

A visual cue may direct the body portion of the human subject toward or along the model path of travel using a number of different approaches. shows a first example approach e.g. referred to as the absolute approach for guiding a human subject toward or along a model path of travel. As depicted in a body portion located at a current position is directed toward a nearest model position of model path of travel by a directional indicator .

Selection of one of the approaches discussed in and may be based at least in part on the task associated with the physical movement. For example a dancing movement may be less stringent about following an exact model path and may therefore utilize a parallel model path of travel that is offset from the model path of travel. Hence under some scenarios the relative approach of may be more appropriate. In contrast some exercises may cause strain or injury to the human subject if physical movement deviates from the model path of travel. Hence under some scenarios the absolute or relaxed absolute approaches of may be more appropriate.
