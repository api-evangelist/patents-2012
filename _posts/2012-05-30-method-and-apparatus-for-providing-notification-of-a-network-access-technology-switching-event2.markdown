The modern communications era has brought about a tremendous expansion of wireline and wireless networks. Computer networks television networks and telephony networks are experiencing an unprecedented technological expansion fueled by consumer demand. Wireless and mobile networking technologies have addressed related consumer demands while providing more flexibility and immediacy of information transfer and providing convenience to users.

Concurrent with the expansion of networking technologies an expansion in computing power has resulted in development of affordable computing devices capable of taking advantage of services made possible by modern networking technologies. This expansion in computing power has led to a reduction in the size of computing devices and given rise to a new generation of mobile devices that are capable of performing functionality that only a few years ago required processing power that could be provided only by the most advanced desktop computers. Consequently mobile computing devices having a small form factor have become ubiquitous and are used to access network applications and services by consumers of all socioeconomic backgrounds and are used to communicate with other devices over mobile networks at a variety of locations.

Given the power and ubiquity of mobile computing devices mobile computing devices now consume a large amount of network bandwidth placing a burden on bandwidth limited cellular networks. As the burden on cellular networks of handling the large data demands of modern mobile computing devices has grown and as network operators charge increasing data rates for data transfer on cellular networks network operators and consumers have increasingly turned to a technology called offloading in order to reduce the network load burden on cellular networks and to reduce data costs charged to consumers. Offloading takes advantage of dual mode communication devices that are capable of accessing a network via both a cellular access and a secondary access such as a wireless local area network WLAN access to send data over a network access other than the cellular network access when an alternative access is available to a mobile computing device.

The communication interface may be embodied as any device or means embodied in circuitry hardware a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium for example memory storing computer readable program instructions for example software or firmware that are executable by a suitably configured processing device for example the processor or a combination thereof that is configured to receive and or transmit data from to another computing device. According to some example embodiments the communication interface may be at least partially embodied as or otherwise controlled by the processor . In this regard the communication interface may be in communication with the processor such as via a bus. The communication interface may additionally be in communication with the memory user interface and or notification handling module such as via a bus es . The communication interface may include for example an antenna a transmitter a receiver a transceiver and or supporting hardware or software for enabling communications with one or more computing devices. The communication interface may be configured to receive and or transmit data using any protocol that may be used for communications between computing devices. In this regard the communication interface may be configured to receive and or transmit data using any protocol that may be used for transmission of data over a wireless network wireline network some combination thereof or the like by which the served apparatus and one or more computing devices or computing resources may be in communication. As an example the communication interface may be configured to support a connection with a communication apparatus via the local network access technology to enable the served apparatus to use the communication apparatus as a gateway to the network . In some example embodiments the communication interface may be configured to support a connection to the network via the first network access technology and or via the second network access technology and or the like for example a connection to a network access point implementing the first network access technology and or via the second network access technology and or the like .

In some example embodiments one or more aspects of the user interface may be limited or the user interface may even be eliminated.

The notification handling module may be embodied as various means such as circuitry hardware a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium for example memory storing computer readable program instructions for example software or firmware that are executable by a suitably configured processing device for example the processor or some combination thereof and in some example embodiments may be embodied as or otherwise controlled by the processor . In embodiments wherein the notification handling module is embodied separately from the processor the notification handling module may be in communication with the processor . The notification handling module may further be in communication with one or more of the memory communication interface or user interface such as via a bus es .

In some example embodiments if a second network access technology access is available to the communication apparatus the connection between the communication apparatus and network may optionally be switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology . Such a network access technology switching event may be performed in accordance with a user specified preference policy at the request of a user in accordance with a network operator defined policy in accordance with a network provisioned policy such as may be provisioned by an Access Network Discovery and Selection Function ANDSF in accordance with a configuration of the communication apparatus such as may be hardcoded or otherwise specified by a manufacturer of the communication apparatus and or specified by a software configuration of an operating system and or other software that may be implemented on the communication apparatus and or the like. In some example embodiments if the connection is switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology the connection to the first network access technology may be dropped entirely in favor of a connection to the second network access technology . Additionally or alternatively in some example embodiments while the connection may be switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology the communication apparatus may still maintain a connection to the cellular network access . In this regard in some example embodiments the communication apparatus offload a select data connection and or select data traffic from the first network access technology to the second network access technology while still maintaining a connection to the network via the first network access technology .

In some instances the communication apparatus may have to drop the connection s via the local network access technology to the served apparatus es as a result of the connection being switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology . Accordingly the served apparatus es may experience a network service disconnection losing connection to the network . In this regard if the communication apparatus switches the connection to an access point operating in accordance with the second network access technology the communication apparatus may not be able to continue to serve as an access point for a served apparatus . For example in some example embodiments the second network access technology and the local network access technology may use the same radio frequency network access technology such as a WLAN access technology and the communication interface may not support multiple parallel connections via the second network access technology. Accordingly in such example embodiments the communication apparatus may not be able to concurrently support both functioning as a client connected to an access point operating in accordance with the second network access technology and serving as an access point for a served apparatus via local network access technology . In this regard in such example embodiments the communication apparatus may not be able to concurrently support both an uplink connection to an access point operating in accordance with the second network access technology and a downlink connection to a served apparatus .

In some example embodiments if the communication apparatus is serving as a gateway to the network for one or more served apparatuses and the connection is to be switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology the notification provision module may be configured to determine that a network access technology switching event is to occur while the communication apparatus is serving as a gateway to the network for a served apparatus . The notification provision module of some example embodiments may be further configured in response to a determination that the network access technology switching event is to occur while the communication apparatus is serving as a gateway to cause a notification indicating that the served device s will experience a network service disconnection to be provided prior to the connection between the communication device and the network being switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology .

In some example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to determine whether the second network access technology conflicts with the local network access technology prior to providing a notification. In this regard if the second network access technology and local network access technology do not use the same access technology and or the communication apparatus may otherwise support concurrent connections to the network via the second network access technology and to one or more served apparatuses via the local network access technology the second network access technology and local network access technology may not be in conflict. Accordingly a notification may not need to be provided in such instances. However if the second network access technology and local network access technology are in conflict such as in the example case where the the second network access technology and local network access technology use the same wireless access technology for example Wi Fi and the communication apparatus only supports one connection at a time via the wireless access technology the notification provision module may determine to provide a notification.

The notification provision module may be configured to provide any of a variety of notifications in various example embodiments. For example in some example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to cause a notification indicating that the served device s will experience a network service disconnection as a result of the connection being switched to the second network access technology to be provided via the user interface so as to provide notice to a user of the communication apparatus . The notification may be provided by any output means that may be available via the user interface . For example the notification may comprise a graphical notification that may be presented on a display of the user interface . Additionally or alternatively the notification may comprise an audible notification that may be output on a speaker that may be included in the user interface . Accordingly the user may for example prepare for the network service disconnection such as by finding alternative network access for the served apparatus es .

In some example embodiments a user of the communication apparatus may be presented with an option to delay and or prevent the connection being switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology . Accordingly in such example embodiments the user may delay and or prevent the connection switch from occurring so that the served apparatus es does not experience a network service disconnection. For example the user may be presented with an option such as via a pop up window or other graphical notification that may be presented on a display of the user interface to permit or deny the connection being switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology . In such example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to prevent the connection from being switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology unless a user selection permitting the connection switch is received. The user selection permitting the connection switch may for example comprise an explicit user selection of an option authorizing the connection to be switched. As another example a user selection permitting the connection switch may comprise an implicit selection that may be determined in response to a lack of a user selection to deny or delay the connection switch such as in embodiments wherein the user may be presented with a dialog indicating that the connection switch will be made unless the user selects to prevent or delay the connection switch within a defined period of time.

In some example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to cause a notification that a served apparatus will experience a network service disconnection to be provided to the served apparatus . This notification may for example comprise a dedicated message that may be sent directly to an intended destination served apparatus . Additionally or alternatively the notification may be broadcast such as via the local network access technology connection such that the notification may be received by any served apparatuses that may be utilizing the communication apparatus as a gateway to the network . A notification that may be provided to a served apparatus in accordance with some example embodiments may for example include an indication of a time remaining until the network service disconnection to enable the served apparatus to make timely preparations for the network service disconnection.

The notification handling module may be configured to receive a notification of an impending network service disconnection that may be sent to a served apparatus by the communication apparatus . The notification handling module may be configured to take action to mitigate impact of the impending network service connection in response to receipt of the notification. For example the notification handling module may be configured to cause a notification to be provided to a user of the served apparatus such as via the user interface so that the user may find an alternative network connection and or otherwise prepare for the network disconnection event. Additionally or alternatively the notification handling module may be configured to automatically identify an alternative network access in response to the notification.

In some example embodiments the notification handling module may be configured to reject and or delay for some period of time switching of the connection from the first network access technology to the second network access technology . In this regard the notification handling module may be configured to cause the served apparatus to send an override request to the communication apparatus and the notification provision module may be configured to delay and or prevent the connection switch in response to the override request. In some such example embodiments the notification handling module may be configured to automatically determine to reject and or delay the connection switch such as if the served apparatus is engaged in an ongoing data transfer or other sensitive data connection. Additionally or alternatively in some such example embodiments a user of the served apparatus may be presented with an option to reject and or delay the connection switch. The notification handling module may accordingly be configured in some example embodiments to cause an override request to be sent to the communication apparatus in response to a user request to reject and or delay the connection switch.

In some example embodiments a notification of an impending network service disconnection that may be provided to a served apparatus may include an identifier for an available access point such as for an access point for the second network access technology to which the connection is being switched. For example if the second network access technology is a Wi Fi or other WLAN access the notification may include a Service Set Identifier SSID for the network access point. In such embodiments the notification handling module may be configured to utilize the identifier for the access point to facilitate discovery of and or connection to the access point.

As a further example in some example embodiments if the communication apparatus may serve as a gateway to the network to a served apparatus via a network access technology other than the local network access technology while being connected to the network via the second network access technology the notification provision module may be configured to include an indication in a notification provided to the served apparatus that the communication apparatus may serves as a gateway via an alternative access technology. The notification may for example further include parameters for establishing a connection to the communication apparatus via the alternative access technology. As an example the local network access technology may comprise Wi Fi but the communication apparatus may be further configured to support a connection to a served apparatus via Bluetooth. Accordingly in such example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to provide an indication to a served apparatus that the served may establish a Bluetooth connection with the communication apparatus so that the communication apparatus may continue to serve as a gateway to the network even after the connection has been switched to the second network access technology .

In some example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to cause the communication apparatus to provide a served apparatus with access credentials for an available access point such as for an access point for the second network access technology to which the connection is being switched. The access credentials may for example be included in a notification of an impending network service disconnection that may be provided to a served apparatus . As another example the access credentials may be provided to the served apparatus in a separate communication. The access credentials may for example comprise a password security key user name and or other credential that may be needed to establish a connection with the access point. The notification handling module may be configured to receive the access credentials and use the access credentials to facilitate establishment of a connection with the access point.

In some example embodiments the notification provision module may be configured to cause the communication apparatus to securely pass the access credentials to the served apparatus . In this regard the access credentials may comprise sensitive information that may be desired to be kept secret from unauthorized entities. As an example the access credentials may be encrypted. As another example the access credentials may be sent to the served apparatus via a secure channel such as a channel using Internet Protocol Security IPSec protocol Transport Layer Security TLS a channel using a secure layer specific signaling message and or the like. As still a further example the communication apparatus and served apparatus may be configured to communicate with each other through use of Bluetooth. The notification provision module and notification handling module may for example be configured to use Bluetooth Subscriber Identity Module SIM access profile to provide the served apparatus with access credential information to enable the served apparatus to perform an authentication such by way of non limiting example an IEE 802.16u authentication to a network access point.

A notification may be provided to the served apparatus es via any of a variety of protocols. By way of non limiting example the notification may be provided using Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP including ICMP version 4 ICMPv4 ICMP version 6 ICMPv6 and or any present or future ICMP version an application layer message on top of UDP User Datagram Protocol such as Universal Plug and Play protocol UPnP Constrained Application Protocol CoAP and or the like and or the like.

As an example an ICMP message such as an ICMP router advertisement may be used to convey the notification. In this regard some example embodiments define a new option. The option may be included in periodic Router Advertisements with status OK but in an instance in which the notification provision module determines that the connection is to be switched from the first network access technology to the second network access technology while the communication apparatus is serving as a gateway to the network for a served apparatus the status may indicate the intent of the router for example the communication apparatus serving as gateway to switch connection. The router advertisement status option provided in accordance with some example embodiments may for example be defined as follows 

It will be appreciated however that the above example option is provided by way of example and not by way of limitation. In this regard alternative option formats are contemplated within the scope of the disclosure. For example in some example embodiments an ICMP message may include an indication of a time remaining until the served device will experience a network service disconnection. In this regard an ICMP message may in some example embodiments include a field indicating a time e.g. in milliseconds seconds or some other unit of time until the served device will experience a network service disconnection.

As a further example some example embodiments define an ICMP message to enable the communication apparatus to indicate the intent of the router for example a communication apparatus serving as a gateway for a served apparatus to switch to the second network access technology and an ICMP message to enable a served apparatus to respond to a notification received from the communication apparatus such as with an override request. In some embodiments an ICMP Router Status Report message may be defined that may for example contain status information substantially similar to that contained in the above example ICMP Router Advertisement. Furthermore in some embodiments an ICMP Router Status Request message may be defined to allow served apparatuses to send an override request requesting a communication apparatus to stop or delay from switching network connection and hence causing served apparatuses to experience a network service disconnection. In some example embodiments in which a notification handling module associated with a served apparatus is configured to send an ICMP message such as an ICMP Router Status Request message requesting that a communication apparatus stop or delay from switching network connection the notification provision module associated with the communication apparatus may be configured to send an ICMP message such as an ICMP Router Report in response to indicate a response to the served apparatus s request. The response may for example include an indication of whether switching of the network connection has been stopped whether switching of the network connection has been delayed how long switching of the network connection has been delayed and or the like.

As another example a Representational State Transfer REST Application Programming Interface API may be used to provide a notification to a served apparatus in some example embodiments. In some example embodiments a REST API may be defined on top of CoAP to enable a notification to be broadcast and or multicast to served apparatuses that may be served by a communication apparatus . In this regard CoAP may not require a Transmission Control Protocol connection to be setup between the communication apparatus and the served apparatus es . Accordingly a single multicast CoAP message may for example be multicast using a UDP message which may for example contain a Universal Resource Locator URL indicating that the connection between the communication apparatus and the network is to be switched to another network access and or that the served apparatus will experience a network service disconnection. For example the communication apparatus may send a multicast CoAP GET PUT POST message to URL coap multicast address 5683 gatewayupdate with information indicating that the connection between the communication apparatus and the network is to be switched to another network access and or that the served apparatus will experience a network service disconnection. For example a message may be sent as follows coap multicast address 5683 gatewayupdate status changingwanconnection newssid hotspot user name foo password bar . In addition to status information for example changingwanconnection the message may include indication indicative of an SSID or other identifier for an accessible access point for example hotspot network access credential information for example username foo password bar and or the like and or other information that may facilitate network access point discovery and or connection establishment by the served apparatus .

In some example embodiments if the communication apparatus moves outside of range of an access point for the second network access technology and or a connection to the network via the second network access technology otherwise becomes unavailable the communication apparatus may switch the connection back to the first network access technology . The communication apparatus may subsequently return to serving as a gateway to the network for a served apparatus es via the local network access technology .
