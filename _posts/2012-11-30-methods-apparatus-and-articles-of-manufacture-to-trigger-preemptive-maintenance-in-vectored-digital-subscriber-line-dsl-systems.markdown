This patent arises from a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 962 397 filed on Dec. 7 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to vectored digital subscriber line DSL systems and more particularly to methods apparatus and articles of manufacture to trigger preemptive maintenance of vectored DSL systems.

Vectored DSL is an emerging DSL technology that offers significant improvements in transmission rates over ordinary telephone lines. In a vectored DSL communication system a vectoring engine uses collected measurements characterizing crosstalk between a set of subscriber lines to reduce the crosstalk noise experienced by those subscriber lines.

Example methods apparatus and articles of manufacture to trigger preemptive maintenance of vectored digital subscriber line DSL systems are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes obtaining a value representing crosstalk coupling between a first subscriber loop and a second subscriber loop the first and second subscriber loops belonging to a vectored DSL group of subscriber loops determining whether to automatically perform a diagnostic test on the first subscriber loop based on the value submitting a trouble ticket for the first subscriber loop based on a result of the diagnostic tests and generating a maintenance report for the vectored DSL group based on the value and the results.

A disclosed example apparatus includes a data analysis module a diagnostic testing module a trouble ticket submitter and a report generator. The data analysis module is to determine whether to automatically initiate a diagnostic test on a first subscriber loop based on a value representing crosstalk coupling between the first subscriber loop and a second subscriber loop the first and second subscriber loops belonging to a vectored DSL group of subscriber loops. The diagnostic testing module is to implement the diagnostic test. The trouble ticket submitter is to submit a trouble ticket for the first subscriber loop based on a result of the diagnostic test. The report generator is to generate a maintenance report for the vectored DSL group based on the value and the result.

While in the illustrated example of the DSLAMs are implemented at the CO any of the DSLAMs may be additionally or alternatively implemented at an RT at an SAI and or at any other location between the CO and the customer premises . In such instances a fiber optic cable not shown may be used for example to communicatively couple the remotely located DSLAMs to the CO .

In the illustrated example of the DSLAM provides DSL services to the CPE DSL modems via respective subscriber loops and . Subscriber loops are sometimes also referred to in the industry as wire pairs subscriber lines and or loops. While throughout this disclosure reference is made to the example subscriber loops of a subscriber loop e.g. any of the example subscriber loops used to provide a DSL service to a customer premises e.g. any of the customer premises may include and or be constructed from one or more segments of copper twisted pair wire e.g. any combination of a feeder one F cable a feeder two F cable a feeder three F cable a feeder four F cable a distribution cable a drop cable and or customer premises wiring terminals and or distributions points e.g. an RT an SAI a serving terminal a vault a pedestal and or any other type s of wiring distribution points . Such segments of copper twisted pair wire may be spliced and or connected end to end and or may be connected at only one end thereby creating one or more bridged taps. Regardless of the number type s gauge s and or topology of copper twisted pair wires used to construct the example subscriber loops they will be referred to herein in the singular form but it will be understood that the term loop may refer to one or more copper twisted pair wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.

The example subscriber loops of are a part of the same cable binder and thus are in the same binder group. Multiple wire pairs sharing the same cable binder such as the example subscriber loops may cause crosstalk or electromagnetic coupling into each other. The noise that results from crosstalk coupling between copper twisted pair wires such as the example subscriber loops may reduce data transmission rates. Vectored DSL technology using advanced signal processing is able to mitigate the crosstalk effects that may cause performance problems for DSL lines. The crosstalk coupling values gathered by vectored DSL technology can be used to identify potential problems in a binder or vectored DSL group. For example excessive crosstalk coupling values might indicate a potential problem on one of the example subscriber loops .

In the illustrated example of the example DSLAM implements a vectoring engine . The example vectoring engine of measures crosstalk coupling between loops in a binder or vectored DSL group such as for example the subscriber loops and works to mitigate the crosstalk coupling. The example methods apparatus and article of manufacture disclosed herein utilize values representative of the crosstalk coupling measured by the vectoring engine to proactively monitor and or analyze subscriber loops of a vectored DSL group and or to automatically trigger maintenance of the subscriber loop s and or the vectored DSL group based on this analysis.

To store among other data the measured crosstalk coupling values the example vectored DSL system of includes a DSL performance database . The crosstalk coupling values may be stored in the example DSL performance database of using any number and or type s of data structures. The example DSL performance database may be implemented by any number and or type s of volatile and or non volatile memory ies memory device s and or storage device s .

To obtain the crosstalk coupling values associated with the example subscriber loops the vectored DSL system of includes an access management system AMS server . The example AMS server of obtains crosstalk coupling values measured by the vectoring engine from the DSLAM using any number and or type s of application programming interface API and stores the crosstalk coupling values in the DSL performance database .

To proactively identify potentially faulty subscriber loops the example vectored DSL system of includes a crosstalk analyzer . The example crosstalk analyzer of accesses the crosstalk coupling values stored in the example DSL performance database via any number and or type s of API. Based on the obtained crosstalk coupling values the example crosstalk analyzer of automatically determines whether additional diagnostic testing trouble shooting and or maintenance should be performed for a particular subscriber loop . For each of the subscriber loops the example crosstalk analyzer periodically or aperiodically queries the example DSL performance database to obtain values that represent the crosstalk coupling between that subscriber loop and other subscriber loops belonging to the same vectored DSL group as the subscriber loop . The crosstalk analyzer compares the crosstalk coupling values with a threshold value to determine whether one or more diagnostic tests should be performed on the presently considered subscriber loop . An example threshold value represents a maximum expected crosstalk coupling for subscriber loops without a potential fault. An example manner of implementing the example crosstalk analyzer of is described below in connection with . An example process that may be carried out to implement the example crosstalk analyzer is described below in connection with .

By proactively monitoring crosstalk coupling between the example subscriber loops of the example crosstalk analyzer of provides a number of benefits to an operator of the example vectored DSL system . For example by proactively identifying subscriber loops that are exhibiting excessive levels of crosstalk the example crosstalk analyzer can facilitate the timely and efficient resolution of identified problems prior to receiving a customer trouble report and or without interrupting the customer s service.

When the example crosstalk analyzer of identifies a subscriber loop as exhibiting an excessive amount of crosstalk coupling the example crosstalk analyzer automatically performs one or more diagnostic tests on the particular subscriber loop using any number and or type s of test equipment . Based on results of the diagnostic test s the crosstalk analyzer determines whether to generate and or submit a trouble ticket to any type of trouble ticket system . Such an automatically generated and or submitted trouble ticket represents preventative prospective forecasted and or projected maintenance needs that could should be performed in order to for example reduce the likelihood or probability that a service problem will be reported by a customer and or reduce the likelihood or probability that a customer s service will be interrupted. In response to the submitted trouble ticket an appropriate service and or maintenance technician can be dispatched to diagnose troubleshoot and or rectify the cause s of the excessive crosstalk coupling associated with the presently considered subscriber loop .

Additionally based on the diagnostic test s the example crosstalk analyzer determines whether crosstalk analyses are to be performed on other subscriber loops in the vectored DSL group associated with the subscriber loops . Once the crosstalk analyses have been performed on the additional subscriber loops the crosstalk analyzer generates a maintenance report for the vectored DSL group based on the crosstalk coupling values and the results of the diagnostic test s . The information in the trouble tickets and or maintenance reports associated with the subscriber loops and any other subscriber loops in the vectored DSL group may be presented and or accessed by a maintenance system via for example a web based graphical user interface GIU and or a web based dashboard.
