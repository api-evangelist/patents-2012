Autophagy is a homeostatic self eating process that has been conserved among eukaryotic cells and which involves the digestion of cytoplasmic components via the lysosomal pathway. Under normal conditions it allows cells to break down long lived proteins thus complementing the action of the proteasome which deals chiefly with short lived proteins. During periods of starvation stimulation of autophagy is important to provide cells exposed to nutrient deprivation with amino acids glucose and fatty acids to maintain metabolism and ATP levels compatible with cell survival.

Stimulation of autophagy plays a critical role in counteracting nutrient deprivation following birth in newborn mice. Under basal conditions autophagy helps the cell to get rid of damaged organelles such as mitochondria and toxic aggregation prone proteins. The functions of autophagy are not limited to these aspects but extend beyond as shown by the discovery of its role in the innate and adaptive immune responses. Autophagy malfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders and infectious diseases. Another important aspect of autophagy in mammalian cells that remains to be unraveled is the role of autophagy in cell death which has been the topic of several recent reviews.

During autophagy part of the cytoplasm containing long lived proteins or organelles is surrounded by a cisternal membrane designated the phagophore by Seglen. The term isolation membrane is also used as a synonym of phagophore. The phagophore then closes to form a double membraned vacuole known as the autophagosome. Autophagosomes use dynein motors to move along microtubules towards the microtubule organizing center where they fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. However most of the autophagosomes receive input from the endocytic compartments before they fuse with lysosomes.

Many AuTophaGy related ATG genes identified in yeast by genetic screens have mammalian counterparts and 18 different Atg proteins are known to be recruited to the isolation membrane where they are involved in autophagosome formation. The origin of the membranes involved in autophagosome formation is unknown but findings suggest the endoplasmic reticulum ER may be the source of lipids in the autophagosomal membranes. Ktistakis and colleagues propose that autophagosomes are formed in a high phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate PtdIns 3P cup shaped compartment known as the omegasome from its omega like shape which is dynamically connected to the ER. Electron tomography analyses demonstrate a direct connection between the ER and the phagophore.

Evidence supports the idea that autophagy can be regulated at several different physiologic levels 1 signaling pathways acting upstream of the autophagy machinery 2 formation of autophagosomes and 3 maturation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes.

The existence of these different levels of autophagy regulation means that there are many different ways in which autophagy can be modulated by compounds relevant to clinical interventions. Moreover the structural biology of Atg proteins is an expanding area of research that should not only reveal the mechanism of action of these proteins but also guide the design of drugs intended to modulate their activity.

Autophagy refers to the process by which lysosomes degrade intracellular constituents including both organelles and soluble proteins. This process is traditionally regarded as a cellular response to stress typically related to nutrient deprivation toxin exposure infection or oxidative stress.

In contrast to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway which degrades mostly short lived proteins autophagy is mainly involved in breaking down proteins with long half lives and damaged organelles. Some basic form of this machinery is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Depending on how lysosomes receive the cargo autophagy can be further classified into three types namely macroautophagy microautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy CMA .

Macroautophagy involves multiple steps beginning with induction and ending with the release of the degraded products to the cytosol. It is characterized by the sequestration of cytosolic components in an autophagic vacuole or autophagosome which fuses with lysosomal membrane to deliver its contents for degradation.

This double membrane vacuole is the morphological hallmark of autophagy. The process is highly inducible in response to stress signals and regulated at various junctures by a large number of autophagy related ATG genes which involves controlling the activity of mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin a suppressor of macroautophagy. Microautophagy is less well studied than macroautophagy. Unlike macroautophagy microautophagy does not involve the formation of double membrane vacuoles.

Rather the defining feature of microautophagy is the invagination or exvagination of lysosomal membrane to sequester cytosolic components. Mitophagy is a term describing the selective sequestration and removal of mitochondria by either macro or microautophagy.

Unlike macro and microautophagy CMA does not involve membrane vacuoles. Rather it is regulated by direct protein interaction. Two key regulators chaperone protein heat shock cognate 70 Hsc70 and lysosomal membrane receptor Lamp2A control the CMA process.

Hsc70 in a complex with other co chaperone proteins binds to cytosolic proteins containing a pentapeptide targeting motif KFERQ and delivers substrate proteins to the surface of lysosomes. Binding of this chaperone substrate complex to Lamp2A leads to the translocation of substrates cross the lysosomal membrane. Both the level and availability of Lamp2A are regulated by stress signals making Lamp2A one of the major modes by which CMA activity is controlled.

Protein restriction with or without caloric restriction can affect disease states and the rate of aging in an organism such as a human in a variety of ways including but not limited to a reducing the rate of production of free radicals as reactive oxygen species in mitochondria leading to reduced oxidation and mutation rates in mitochondrial DNA and RNA b decreasing the degree of membrane fatty acid unsaturation in cells including in the mitochondrial inner membrane lowering the susceptibility of membranes to oxidative damage and c increasing autophagy to repair or replace cellular structures such as damaged organelles and proteins.

According to aspects of the subject technology a physician other health care professional or subject person can adjust the amount and duration of restriction and or nonrestriction of protein administered to the person. By following principles of the subject technology as described herein those of skill in the art can without difficulty or undue experimentation to adjust or titrate nutritional parameters such as daily protein intake and the number of days of protein restriction to optimize the attainment in the person of such endpoints as disease prevention or amelioration. This is accomplished by for example observing the effect of any significant change in a pattern of the person s protein intake over weeks to months. If signs of protein deficiency appear in the person such as cold intolerance hypoalbuminemia or particular changes in skin hair and or nails an amount of protein administered to the person can easily be increased.

According the subject technology the degree of consumption or restriction of a person s protein or other macronutrient intake may be specified either in absolute or relative terms such as by e.g. daily or weekly total intake or in mass or weight of protein per mass or weight of a person or her fat mass or her lean mass e.g. mg of protein or other macronutrient per kg of the person s bodyweight . All claimed methods compositions and systems are intended to encompass any such type of specification. Thus all methods and systems disclosed as one of the following two options relative or absolute macronutrient intake also includes the other 

First exemplary option i during a lower protein period the person receives a lower protein portion such that the person s bodily intake of protein is restricted to less than 0.4 mg kg of the person s bodyweight per day and ii during a higher protein period that is after the lower protein period the person receives a higher protein portion such that the person s bodily intake of protein exceeds 0.6 mg kg of the person s bodyweight per day.

Second exemplary option i administering nutrients to the person such that the person s bodily intake of protein is restricted to less than 40 grams per day during a lower protein period of at least one day and ii after the lower protein period administering nutrients to the person such that the person s bodily intake of protein exceeds 40 grams per day during a higher protein period.

Some aspects of the subject technology include a method for providing nutrients to a person to maintain or enhance health comprising providing nutrient material administrable to at least one of a person s gastrointestinal tract or intravascular space and comprising at least one of lipid or carbohydrate wherein all of any protein in the material constitutes less than 5 percent of a caloric content of the material instructing that the material be administered to the person such that the person s bodily intake of at least one of protein peptides or amino acids is restricted to less than 30 grams per day during a lower protein time period of at least 48 hours instructing that carbohydrate be or may be administered to the person such that the person s bodily intake of carbohydrate is at least 40 grams per day during the lower protein period and instructing that during a higher protein time period that is after the lower protein period and is at least 24 hours the person receives a higher bodily intake of protein than the person received during the lower protein period such that the average daily bodily intake of all protein during the higher protein period is at least 40 grams.

In some embodiments the lower protein period can be at least 24 hours at least 36 hours at least 72 hours at least 96 hours at least 120 hours or similar minimum duration.

The inventor has found that autophagy in at least hepatocytes and neurons is unexpectedly stimulated to a beneficial degree during periods of dietary protein restriction despite a concomitant dietary carbohydrate intake of e.g. at least 40 grams per day or at least 60 percent of total caloric intake and despite its attendant elevation of insulin. Elevated insulin has been previously thought to prevent generally uniformly autophagy or to prevent substantial increases in autophagy.

Emerging evidence supports the view that dysregulation of autophagy may contribute to the pathogenic process in Parkinson s disease PD . Several genetic risk factors associated with PD have been connected to different forms of autophagy. This includes evidence demonstrating that both macroautophagy and CMA regulate a synuclein. Furthermore the CMA process can be disrupted by the a synuclein A53T mutant. Similarly it has been shown that the ubiquitin C terminal hydrolase L1 UCH L1 mutant 194M interrupts the CMA process by binding to Lamp2A with abnormally high affinity. Parkin has been shown to be re localized to mitochondria following mitochondrial damage which promotes mitophagy.

LRRK2 mutants have been recently found to induce the increase or accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. Loss of PINK1 function has been proposed to affect autophagy.

Strong experimental and epidemiological data exist to support an etiological role for neurotoxins in PD. There are hints that many of these toxins may also alter the process of autophagy. For example mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone can inhibit capacity of autophagy. 6 OHDA up regulates LC3 in nigral DA neurons. Paraquat induces the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles.

These toxins may affect CMA. Some studies show that limited exposure to 6 OHDA activates CMA by increasing the levels of Lamp2A.

Intracellular protein misfolding and aggregation are features of many late onset neurodegenerative diseases called proteinopathies. These include Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease tauopathies and polyglutamine expansion diseases e.g. Huntington s disease and various spinocerebellar ataxias SCAs like SCA3 . There are no effective strategies to slow or prevent the neurodegeneration resulting from these diseases in humans. The mutations causing many proteinopathies e.g. polyglutamine diseases and tauopathies confer novel toxic functions on the specific protein and disease severity frequently correlates with the expression levels of the protein. Thus the factors regulating the synthesis and clearance of these aggregate prone proteins are putative therapeutic targets. The proteasome and autophagy lysosomal pathways are the major routes for mutant huntingtin fragment clearance. While the narrow proteasome barrel precludes entry of oligomers and aggregates of mutant huntingtin or other aggregate prone intracellular proteins such substrates can be degraded by macroautophagy.

Rapamycin reduces levels of soluble and aggregated huntingtin and attenuates its toxicity in cells and in transgenic Drosophila and mouse models.

The range of intracellular proteinopathy substrates that are cleared by autophagy includes other targets including proteins mutated in certain SCAs forms of synuclein mutated in familial forms of Parkinson s disease and tau mutants that cause frontotemporal dementia tauopathy. In this chapter we consider the therapeutic potential of autophagy upregulation for various proteinopathies and describe how this strategy may act both by removing the primary toxin the misfolded aggregate prone protein and by reducing susceptibility to apoptotic insults.

Intracellular protein misfolding and aggregation are features of many late onset neurodegenerative diseases called proteinopathies. These include Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease tauopathies and various diseases caused by abnormally expanded tracts of the amino acid glutamine like Huntington s disease HD . HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion which results in an abnormally long polyglutamine polyQ tract in the N terminus of huntingtin. Asymptomatic individuals have 35 or fewer CAG repeats while HD is caused by expansions of 36 or more repeats.

HD belongs to a group of human neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG repeat polyQ expansions which includes spinocerebellar ataxias SCAs type 1 2 3 6 7 and 17 spinobulbar muscular dystrophy SBMA and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy DRPLA .

Autophagy is a bulk degradation process that involves the sequestration of portions of cytoplasm by a double membrane autophagosome followed by digestion of the sequestered material when the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome full of hydrolytic enzymes.

Researchers have found that loss of autophagy causes neurodegeneration even in the absence of any disease associated mutant proteins which suggests that the continuous clearance of cellular proteins through basal autophagy prevents their accumulation and in turn prevents neurodegeneration. Experiments in fly and mouse models have provided proof of principle that stimulation of autophagy can prevent and even reverse neurodegenerative disease.

The compound that has been used for such studies the immunosuppressant rapamycin stimulates autophagy and aggregate digestion by inhibiting the evolutionarily conserved protein kinase TOR target of rapamycin . TOR acts as a brake on autophagy thus when it is inhibited with rapamycin autophagy is turned on.

TOR does not control autophagy alone it is also an activator of ribosome biogenesis and other pathways involved in cell growth. This causes undesired side effects such as immunosuppression during long term administration of rapamycin and therefore alternative inducers of autophagy are desired.

Dietary restriction of total calories without malnutrition has been shown to prolong life in rats mice dogs fish spiders fleas flies worms yeasts and monkeys.

Dietary protein restriction can achieve many of the same effects as calorie restriction though protein restriction is generally better tolerated by humans than severe calorie restriction.

One approach to treating and or preventing any disease according to the subject technology is to restrict protein markedly for a first period then to resume normal protein feeding during a second period. This accomplishes two goals 1 stimulating autophagy during the first period thereby helping clear cells of debris and 2 preventing protein malnutrition during the second period.

In some embodiments protein intake may be restricted for up to one day followed by a period of differing protein intake. The subject technology however also includes restricting protein for longer periods for at least two days for example followed by a period of normal to high protein intake. This produces the unexpected result of achieving a more profound degree of autophagy in a subject without producing protein deficiency protein malnutrition or protein calorie malnutrition. This longer duration of autophagy better assists in clearing cells of abnormal proteins e.g. oxidized glycated and fructated proteins and abnormal organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes. This can assist in preventing and treating diseases caused or exacerbated by an accumulation of cellular debris such as in the heart pancreas liver brain and skeletal muscles leading to organ dysfunction.

Protein restriction can be used according to the subject technology to enhance autophagy and in some cases induce cell death through apoptosis or otherwise in patients with neoplasms that either benign e.g. meningioma or malignant e.g. astrocytoma . In glioma cells the drug minocycline induces nonapoptotic cell death which is associated with the presence of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Minocycline induces autophagy as confirmed by acridine orange monodansylcadaverine MDC stainings of vesicle formation and the conversion of microtubule associated proteins light chain 3 LC3 I to LC3 II. Pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3 methyladenine 3 MA suppresses induction of acidic vesicular organelles and the accumulation of LC3 II to the autophagosome membrane in glioma cells treated with minocycline. Despite the pretreatment of 3 MA minocycline induces cell death via apparent activation of caspase 3. Minocycline effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces autophagy in the xenograft tumor model of C6 glioma cells. Thus minocycline appears to kill glioma cells by inducing autophagic cell death. As a result stimulation of autophagy by restriction of protein intake according to principles of the subject technology is a promising therapeutic intervention for malignant gliomas and other cancers.

As used herein an autoimmune disorder is any disorder known or suspected by medical researchers to be related to self targeting of a mammalian e.g. human immune system such that inflammation results. Each of the following disorders is known or suspected to be autoimmune in nature and can in certain cases be treated prevented and or have its severity or progression lessened in a person by restriction of the person s bodily intake of protein according to methods and systems of the subject technology.

According to embodiments of the subject technology by restricting protein intake in persons who have or are at risk for autoimmune disorders one can decrease cellular damage decrease the susceptibility of cells to damage and at least by increasing autophagy increase cleanup of the damage in some cases.

In both genetic and dietary models of obesity one can observe a marked downregulation of autophagy particularly in Atg7 expression levels in liver. Suppression of Atg7 both in vitro and in vivo results in defective insulin signaling and elevated endoplasmic reticulum ER stress. In contrast restoration of Atg7 expression in liver results in dampened ER stress enhanced hepatic insulin action and systemic glucose tolerance in obese mice. Beneficial Atg7 restoration in obese mice can be prevented by blocking a downstream autophagy mediator Atg5 supporting the concept of Atg7 s dependence on autophagy for regulating insulin action. Thus autophagy is an important regulator of organelle function and insulin signaling and loss of autophagy contributes strongly to the defective insulin action of obesity which in turn leads to many known sequelae and is associated with for example hypertension hyperlipidemia hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia certain cancers cholelithiasis depression coronary artery disease peripheral vascular disease type 2 diabetes Alzheimer s disease and other dementia syndromes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and failure of pancreatic beta cells producing insulin. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in both processes of diabetes. Autophagy which can be upregulated by restriction of dietary energy and or protein maintains cellular homeostasis through degradation and recycling of organelles such as mitochondria. As dysfunctional mitochondria are the main organelles removed by autophagy one can observe the role of autophagy in diabetes using mice with beta cell specific deletion of for example the Atg7 gene. Atg7 mutant mice show reduction in beta cell mass and pancreatic insulin content. Electron microscopy shows swollen mitochondria and other ultrastructural changes in autophagy deficient beta cells. Insulin secretory function ex vivo is also impaired. As a result Atg7 mutant mice show hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Autophagy appears necessary to maintain structure mass and function of beta cells. Besides its effect on beta cells autophagy affects insulin sensitivity because mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in insulin resistance and autophagy is involved in the maintenance of organelles including mitochondria. Furthermore since aging is associated with impaired glucose tolerance decline of autophagic activity appears to be involved in age associated reduction of glucose tolerance.

Autophagy acts an immune mechanism. One of the model systems showing how autophagy and more traditional immunity systems cooperate in defense against intracellular pathogens is macrophage infection with is a significant human pathogen that latently infects billions of people and causes active disease in millions of patients worldwide. The ability of the tubercle bacillus to persist in human populations rests upon its macrophage parasitism. Autophagy can act as a cell autonomous innate immunity mechanism capable of eliminating intracellular bacteria e.g. . Embodiments of the subject technology recognize that 1 autophagy functions as an innate defense mechanism against intracellular microbes 2 autophagy is under the control of pattern recognition receptors PRR such as Toll like receptors TLR and it acts as an immunological output effector of PRR and TLR signaling 3 autophagy is one of the effector functions associated with the immunity regulated GTPases which are molecules involved in cell autonomous defense 4 autophagy is an immune effector of Th1 Th2 T cell response polarization autophagy is activated by Th1 cytokines acting in defense against intracellular pathogens and is inhibited by Th2 cytokines making cells accessible to intracellular pathogens . As an ancient innate immunity defense autophagy became integrated over the course of evolution with other immune mechanisms of increasing complexity.

Age related macular degeneration AMD is the major cause of blindness in the elderly over 1.75 million people having reduced vision due to AMD in the United States. AMD is broadly divided into two forms dry and wet that account for about 85 and 15 of cases respectively. An early sign of AMD is the appearance of drusen which are extracellular deposits that accumulate on Bruch s membrane and are thought to derive from the overlying retinal pigment epithelium RPE . Scientists have proposed that increased autophagy and the release of intracellular proteins via exosomes by the aged RPE may contribute to the formation of drusen. Furthermore a decline in autophagic efficiency in the RPE is associated with the later pathological stages of AMD and cellular dysfunction.

Chronic kidney disease can in certain cases be treated prevented and or have its severity or progression lessened in a person by episodic restriction of the person s bodily intake of protein according to methods and systems of the subject technology.

Male pattern baldness or alopecia androgenica is marked typically by higher levels of 5 alpha reductase lower levels of total testosterone higher levels of unbound free testosterone and higher levels of total free androgens including DHT. 5 alpha reductase is responsible for converting free testosterone into DHT. The enzymes are present predominantly in the scalp and prostate. Levels of 5 alpha reductase are one factor in determining levels of DHT in the scalp. Drugs which interfere with 5 alpha reductase such as finasteride which inhibits the predominant type 2 isoform have been approved by the FDA as treatments for hair loss.

Sex hormone binding globulin SHBG which is responsible for binding testosterone and preventing its bioavailability and conversion to DHT is typically lower in individuals with high DHT. SHBG is downregulated by insulin.

Increased levels of Insulin Growth Factor 1 IGF 1 have been correlated to vertex balding and IGF 1 may be lowered by protein restriction. High insulin levels seem a possible link between metabolic syndrome and baldness. Low levels of SHBG in men and non pregnant women are also correlated with glucose intolerance and diabetes risk though this correlation disappears during pregnancy.

By increasing autophagy by protein restriction destruction of hair follicles and consequent hair loss can in some cases be delayed or possibly avoided.
