This invention was made at least in part with U.S. Government support under contract number N00019 06 C 0081 awarded by the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present invention is related to hold up circuits and in particular to a system and method of recording performance and detecting failures in hold up circuits.

Hold up circuitry is employed in a variety of applications to keep a unit or device functional for a limited period of time following the interruption of input power. Hold up circuitry includes a power storage device such as a capacitor that stores power during normal operation and supplies the stored power to the unit or device following interruption of input power. The limited amount of power provided by the power storage device allows the unit or device to perform any necessary functions before shutting down completely.

Failures in the power storage device are traditionally difficult to detect. Oftentimes a failure of the power storage device is only detected when the device fails to supply power for the time required during a failure of the input power thus resulting in a latent failure of the system.

A fault detection circuit is utilized to automatically detect faults in hold up power storage devices. The fault detection circuit includes a hold up monitoring circuit connected to monitor output of the hold up power storage device wherein the hold up monitoring circuit measures a duration of time that the hold up power storage device provides sufficient power following a loss of normal power and detects faults based on the measured duration of time.

The present invention provides a system and method for automatically detecting faults associated with hold up power storage circuits or devices. In particular faults are detected by measuring the amount of time that the hold up power storage device provides sufficient power following a loss of normal power.

System power is provided via diode D to input of power supply . Power supply converts distributes the power supplied by system power to one or more outputs or loads not shown via output terminals and . At least one of the outputs e.g. output of power supply is provided to charge hold up power storage device . During normal operation when system power is On hold up power storage device is fully charged and remains fully charged until system power turns Off.

Power monitor monitors the system power to detect a loss of system power. Loss of power refers both to catastrophic losses of power due to a failure and regular loss of power associated with normal shutdown of a system. Monitoring of the system power may include monitoring the voltage current or a combination thereof supplied by system power to power supply . Upon detecting a loss of system power power monitor closes switch circuit to connect hold up power storage device to input of power supply thereby maintaining power to power supply and those loads connected to power supply for a limited amount of time. The power supplied by hold up power storage device allows power supply and systems receiving power from power supply to remain functional for a specified minimum amount of time and then shut down in an orderly fashion. Included in systems receiving power from power supply is fault detection circuit which must remain powered during loss of system power.

Fault detection circuit measures the storage capacity of power storage device . The measurement by fault detection circuit is performed during the power down cycle e.g. when system power is lost either through a fault or shut down and is based on the duration of time that hold up power storage device provides the desired amount of power. In general hold up monitoring circuit monitors the state of system power and in response to a loss of system power starts timer . Hold up monitoring circuit monitors the power supplied by hold up power storage device and when the monitored power falls below a threshold value hold up monitoring circuit stops timer . The value stored by timer is an indication of the storage capacity of power storage device . The measured timer value is stored in memory .

In the embodiment shown in the output provided by hold up power monitor circuit to switching circuit is also provided to hold up monitoring circuit . In this way monitoring circuit is not responsible and does not need to include circuitry for directly monitoring system power but rather relies on the monitoring provided by power monitor circuit . When power monitor circuit detects a loss of system power this is communicated to both switching circuit and hold up monitoring circuit . In response hold up monitoring circuit begins the timer used to measure the storage capacity of hold up power storage device . In other embodiments hold up monitoring circuit directly monitors the system power to detect a loss of system power. In this embodiment hold up monitoring circuit may utilize the same threshold utilized by power monitor circuit to detect loss of system power such that both circuits trigger at the same threshold level.

In response to a detected loss of system power hold up monitoring circuit starts timer which may be implemented in software hardware or a combination thereof. Hold up monitoring circuit monitors power supplied by hold up power storage device which may include monitoring voltage current or a combination thereof and compares the monitored power to a threshold value. In one embodiment the threshold value is selected so as to provide sufficient time for monitoring circuit to stop timer and store the value associated with timer to memory before all power is lost. Upon reaching the threshold value hold up monitoring circuit stops timer and causes the value of timer to be stored to memory . The stored timer value is representative of the storage capacity of power storage device . In one embodiment memory only stores a single timer value which is rewritten with each new power down cycle. In other embodiments memory is capable of storing a plurality of timer values collected over successive power down cycles. Storing a plurality of timer values allows fault detection circuit to monitor changes in storage capacity over time and make determinations regarding the health of power storage unit based on historical data.

Hold up monitoring circuit generates a fault signal indicating a fault in power storage device . In one embodiment hold up monitoring circuit compares the timer value provided by timer and stored to memory to a threshold timer value also stored in memory to determine whether storage capacity has diminished beyond an acceptable level. If the timer value is less than the threshold timer value then hold up monitoring circuit generates a fault signal. The fault signal may be communicated to a higher level controller or system for reporting to a user or maintenance system. In addition hold up monitoring circuit may communicate timer values stored to memory either all timer values or only those indicative of a fault condition for subsequent review or processing by the higher level controller or system. In another embodiment hold up monitoring circuit only provides timer values as an output and leaves higher level controllers not shown to process the values and determine whether storage capacity has degraded.

At time the measure of hold up power reaches a threshold value indicating that only a limited amount of power remains which triggers stopping of the timer. This threshold may vary based on the application but typically represents the point at which only enough power remains to shut down systems gracefully. The difference between time and time represents the hold up time and is a measure of the storage capacity associated with power storage device . At time nearly all power has been depleted from power storage device and the system resets as indicated by system reset waveform.

In the embodiment shown in the process starts at step with monitoring for loss of system power. At step fault detection circuit monitors whether a loss of system power has been detected. Fault detection circuit may monitor system power directly or may monitor for a signal provided by another circuit such as power monitor circuit indicating that loss of system power has been detected. If no loss of system power has been detected then monitoring continues at step . If loss of system power has been detected at step then fault detection circuit starts the timer at step .

At step fault detection circuit monitors the power supplied by power storage device . This may include monitoring the voltage current or a combination thereof. At step fault detection circuit determines whether the monitored power provided by the power storage device is less than a threshold value indicating near total discharge of power storage device . If the monitored power is not less than a threshold value then monitoring continues at step . If the monitored power is less than a threshold value then at step fault detection circuit stops timer thereby setting the duration of the hold up time. At step the timer value is stored to memory just prior to all power being lost. In other embodiments storing the timer value may also include communicating the timer value to a higher level controller or comparing the timer value to a threshold value to determine whether or not to generate a fault condition. In some embodiments the fault condition is generated prior to total shutdown of the system and in other embodiments the fault condition is not generated until the next power up cycle at which time fault detection circuit retrieves the stored timer value from memory compares it to a threshold value and generates a corresponding fault condition if required.
