title: Method and apparatus of heat treating an integrally bladed rotor
abstract: A process for heat treating selected portions of an integrally bladed rotor (IBR) having a plurality of blades, the process using an IBR on a fixture having a rotor engaging portion that moves the IBR into an environmental chamber. An IR heater is placed on one of the IBR blades and heat treated after air has been removed from the chamber and an inert gas is added. The IR heater is lifted from the blade and indexed to position another blade on the IBR. The process is repeated until all the IBR blades are heat treated.

This invention is a continuation in part of an application titled Local Heat Treatment of IBR Blade Using Infrared Heating filed Jul. 18 2011 and having Ser. No. 13 184 733 the disclosure of which in incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under F33657 03 D 0016 0010 awarded by the United States Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Heat treatment of integrally bladed rotors IBR or bladed disks blisk is required to obtain appropriate material properties and to relieve residual stresses due to fusion welding processes such as for example electron beam welding laser welding or arc welding as well as solid state bonding processes such as linear friction welding.

Heat treatment is typically performed by exposing the entire IBR or a portion of the IBR e.g. the weld region to a predetermined thermal cycle. The technique of heat treating the entire IBR is commonly known in the art of IBR manufacture.

During blade repair operations it may be necessary to locally heat treat the repaired areas of the integrally bladed rotors that have been exposed to elevated temperatures resulting from repair operations. In the finished machine condition conventional heat treatment is not always possible due to concerns with part distortion. Additional risk factors for conventional heat treatment of a repaired finished machined integrally bladed rotor are a it may create unnecessary risk due to the potential for surface contamination throughout the entire part and b some areas of the IBR should not be exposed to additional temperature exposure that results in material property debit. Because of these concerns local heat treatment has been considered to be a preferred option.

IBRs are typically made of either titanium alloys such as Ti 6 4 Ti 6 2 4 2 Ti 6 2 4 6 alloys or nickel based alloys such as Alloy 718 alloy or IN 100. The IBR is a critical rotating component within an engine and the engineering materials manufacturing and quality requirements are extremely rigorous.

There are two major technical challenges associated with the local heat treatment of an IBR in addition to the business challenge that the manufacturing process be affordable. First the selected portion of the IBR receiving heat treatment must meet a prescribed thermal cycle and the remaining IBR component must not be exposed to temperatures that exceed a specific peak temperature to ensure that the material properties meet engineering requirements. Second the selected portion of the IBR receiving localized heat treatment must be protected from oxidation due to exposure to high temperature.

The present invention comprises a process and system for using a directional focused infrared IR heater to heat treat specific areas on the blades of IBR devices using a holding fixture for mounting the IBR an environmental chamber for performing the heat treatment a heater support unit that positions the heater on the IBR blades and a control unit for precisely indexing the support unit on to successive blades until all the repaired blades are heat treated.

This heat treatment is done using a heater that is capable of placement of infrared heat sources on the individual integral blades in an inert environment which in one form uses parabolic minors to focus heat only onto the desired area.

The process of this invention provides for localized heat treatments for integrally bladed rotors IBR as shown in . The IBR to be treated is loaded on a holding fixture as seen in step . The heater support unit is mounted onto the IBR holding fixture and the IR heater is lowered on to the first blade of the IBR in step . The IBR is then placed in an environmental chamber in step . The chamber is closed evacuated and backfilled with an inert gas such as for example argon or helium in step . The selected blade is heat treated in step . In step the heater is lifted the IBR is indexed to present the next repaired blade the heater is lowered and that blade is heat treated. Step is repeated so that all of the individual repaired blades on the IBR are heat treated. Once this is done the chamber is opened and the IBR is removed as noted in step .

Loaded mounting fixture is placed on tracks and is moved into environmental chamber . Tracks can be configured in other manners as long as it is capable of moving mounting fixture into and out of chamber as needed.

Door is closed and chamber is evacuated via vent . Both door and back wall of chamber have windows so the operation can be observed as heater is lowered on to successive blades of .

The process and system of this invention provides a means for critical hardware such as IBR units to receive the desired thermal cycle at the specific location where it is needed. An indexing component of the process and system treats every blade without opening the chamber. The heat treatment takes place in a protective environment to avoid formation of undesirable constituents such as alpha case. The process and system of this invention is suitable for OEM manufacture and for repair of existing IBR systems.

Heater is described in the co pending application identified in paragraph 0001 above. In addition other heaters having other designs may be used. It is necessary that the heater be able to be placed on and removed from each IBR blade as the blades are sequentially indexed. The heater must be able to heat treat the desired region of each blade without allowing undesired heat to affect the remaining portion of the blade. Following is a description of from the above identified parent application.

Device is positioned proximate an integrally bladed rotor IBR airfoil for heating a portion of the IBR airfoil and thereby eliminate overall part exposure to heat. Device includes a pair of infrared IR lamp housings and each with an IR lamp generating IR rays that are reflected off parabolic mirrors and respectively to contact IBR and heat treat that blade without exposing any other part of IBR airfoil to unwanted heat.

Device also includes tubes or passages shown more clearly in that are connected to a source of water or other cooling medium not shown to cool portions of device to prevent distortion and a resulting uneven heating. Other cooling devices such as fans and refrigerants may also be used.

Also shown in are dotted lines that represent the extent of unfocused IR rays from lamps and dashed lines represent the extent of IR rays focused by minors and onto the portion of airfoil that is to be heat treated such as to relieve stress in the metal after welding airfoil to rotor hub .

It is known that heat treatment in the presence of oxygen can cause titanium alloys to become embrittled if the temperature exceeds 1 000 F. 538 C. . In addition to embrittlement the material properties of titanium alloys changes if it is exposed to a temperature exceeding 800 F. 427 C. but as will be understood the actual temperature depends on the specific alloy. Oxygen contamination at referenced temperatures can be avoided by proper protection such as the use of inert shielding gas such as argon and helium. The present invention ensures that the portion s of the product being treated will receive desired thermal treatment but generally remain below 1 000 F. 538 C. and even below 800 F. 427 C. .

The present invention was used to heat treat and stress relieve a plurality of IBR blades without adversely heating other critical areas of the IBR. In addition replacement blades have been attached to an IBR by focusing the heat only at the desired location e.g. where the replacement blade is attached to the IBR. The device of this invention is suitable for OEM manufacture and for repair of existing IBR systems.

While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment s it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment s disclosed but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
