The operating system is also a program which provides an application programming interface hereinafter referred to as API for each program to command hardware or to obtain information that is calculated by the inclination sensor and other components.

The storage portion includes a set value storage area and the image file storage area . The set value storage area stores for example a file type flag a selected image page number and a display setting which will be described below. The file type flag is information which represents a file type of an image file to be displayed namely a to be displayed image file or a display target image file. Examples of the file type include a book file which contains a plurality of image data respectively representative of a plurality of images. Every consecutive two of some or all of these images constitute a pair of right and left pages in other words these images have a two page spread relationship. The selected image page number is a page number which indicates a page number i.e. an order number of an image to be displayed as a selected image G among the plurality of images respectively based on the plurality of image data contained in the image file. It is noted that page numbers are sequentially assigned to the respective images.

The display setting is a setting for a layout of the image s displayed on the panel . The display setting includes a one page layout a right binding two page spread layout and a left binding two page spread layout . The one page layout is a layout in which a single image is displayed on the panel . The right binding two page spread layout is a layout in which when two consecutive images are displayed on the respective right and left pages the page number of the image increases from the right page to the left page that is a page number of the right image is smaller than that of the left image. The right binding two page spread layout is mainly used when the panel displays an image that contains texts written vertically. The left binding two page spread layout is an layout in which when two consecutive images are displayed on the respective right and left pages the page number of the image increases from the left page to the right page that is the page number of the left image is smaller than that of the right image. The left binding two page spread layout is mainly used when the panel displays an image that contains texts written horizontally.

The image file storage area is an area which stores a plurality of image files. Each of the image files contains a plurality of image data. Each of the plurality of image data is used for displaying a corresponding one of different images. In the following explanation the images based on the image data contained in the image file may be described as images contained in the image file.

Examples of the image file include a file that is obtained by scanning printed materials in the form of a bound book or document. In this case images obtained by scanning pages of the book are the plurality of images contained in the image file. An order of the page numbers of the plurality of images contained in the image file corresponds to that of page numbers of the book.

Each of the plurality of images contained in the image file may be a portrait image. The portrait image is an image that is arranged in an orientation in which the user facing a display surface of the panel can properly view or read the image where the panel having a rectangular display region is positioned such that its short sides extend in a horizontal direction and its long sides extend in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction. This state of the mobile phone is called a vertical orientation. On the other hand a landscape image which differs from the portrait image in its orientation is an image that is arranged in an orientation in which the user facing the display surface of the panel can properly view or read the image where the panel having the rectangular display region is positioned such that its long sides extend in the horizontal direction and its short sides extend in the direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction. This state of the mobile phone is called a horizontal orientation.

The panel displays thereon various functional information of the mobile phone . The display surface of the panel is the rectangular display region having the short sides and the long sides. The inclination sensor is a sensor which detects an angular velocity to measure an inclination angle of the mobile phone with respect to a horizontal plane.

The mobile phone is a vertical and horizontal model. The vertical and horizontal model is a model in which the user can operate the mobile phone properly even where the panel is in a vertical orientation or a horizontal orientation. The vertical orientation of the panel having the rectangular display region is an orientation in which its short sides extend in the horizontal direction and its long sides extend in the direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction. The horizontal orientation of the panel having the rectangular display region is an orientation in which its long sides extend in the horizontal direction and its short sides extend in the direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction. It is noted that in a case where there are a plurality of image data which represent portrait images numbers are respectively assigned to the plurality of image data in order. The numbers assigned to the respective image data may be assigned in an order of scanning when the printed materials are scanned or in an order of obtainment when images are obtained by taking with a digital camera or a download through an Internet for example. Also the numbers may be numbers that are intentionally assigned by a user of an application of e.g. a PC to data created by the application. These numbers may be indicated by file names of the respective image data by headers of the respective image data or by management data that differs from the image data and contains information about management of the image data.

There will be next explained operations of the mobile phone according to the first embodiment with reference to .

There will be explained with reference to a processing for obtaining and storing the image file using the scan application . When the user operates the input button portion to activate the scan application the CPU activates the scan application and a flow in begins.

At S the CPU judges whether the user has instructed the mobile phone to command the MFP to perform a scanning operation. When the instruction has not been received S NO this flow repeats S. When the instruction is received S YES this flow goes to S at which the CPU transmits a command for performing the scanning operation to the MFP using the wireless communication . Upon receipt of the command the MFP scans a document placed on a document table not shown to create an image file.

At S the CPU judges whether the mobile phone has received from the MFP the image file created by the MFP . The image file may contain any type of the image data for example may contain image data created using JPEG Joint Photographic Experts Group compression. When the image file has not received S NO this flow repeats S and when the image file is received S YES this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU judges whether the image file received is an image file that can employ an exchangeable image file format hereinafter referred to as Exif . The image file that can employ Exif is a file which can contain additional information such as a type of image data and a date and time taken. Where the image file received is not the image file that can employ Exif S NO this flow ends and when the image file received is the image file that can employ Exif S YES this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU judges whether the type of the image file is the book file. At this step the CPU may judge whether the type of the image file is the book file by judging whether the user has input information that the document to be scanned is a book when the mobile phone at S has received the instruction to perform the scanning operation for example. At S the CPU attaches information of this image file being the book file as the additional information to the image file that can employ Exif and this flow ends.

There will be next explained with reference to a processing using the viewer application for displaying a plurality of images contained in one image file. When the user operates the input button portion to activate the viewer application the CPU activates the viewer application and a flow in begins.

At S the CPU judges which of the plurality of image files stored in the image file storage area has been selected as the to be displayed image file. For example icons representative of the respective image files are displayed on the panel and the CPU judges whether the user has touched any of the icons. When the to be displayed image file has not been selected S NO this flow repeats S and when the to be displayed image file is selected S YES this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU sets the selected image page number to 1 . As a result a front image of the plurality of images contained in the to be displayed image file is selected as the selected image G that is an image to be displayed.

At S the CPU executes a book file determination processing. Here the book file determination processing will be explained with reference to . The book file determination processing is a processing for judging whether the to be displayed image file is the book file.

At S the CPU judges whether a format of the to be displayed image file is a format for an electronic book. Examples of the format for the electronic book include an EPUB and an XMIDF ever eXtending Mobile Document Format . Where the format of the to be displayed image file is the format for the electronic book S YES the CPU determines that the image file is the book file and the processing goes to S at which the CPU sets the file type flag to the book file. Upon completion of S the book file determination processing ends.

On the other hand the format of the to be displayed image file is not the format for the electronic book S NO this flow goes to S at which the CPU judges whether the to be displayed image file contains the additional information according to Exif. Where the to be displayed image file does not contain the additional information S NO this flow goes to S and where the to be displayed image file contains the additional information S YES this flow goes to S. At S the CPU reads the additional information contained in the to be displayed image file and judges whether the additional information contains the information that the image file is the book file. Where the additional information contains the information that the image file is the book file S YES the CPU determines that the image file is the book file and the processing then goes to S at which the CPU sets the file type flag to the book file. Upon completion of S the book file determination processing ends.

On the other hand where the additional information does not contain the information that the image file is the book file S NO this flow goes to S at which the CPU judges whether a size of the document used for the creation of the images contained in the image file is equal to or smaller than A4 size. The judgment of the size of the document is executed for a front image in the image file for example. It is noted that where the CPU at S judges that the format of the to be displayed image file is the format for the electronic book the CPU judges that the plurality of images contained in the to be displayed image file have the two page spread relationship in which every consecutive two of some or all of these images constitute a pair of right and left pages. In this case the CPU sets the file type flag of the to be displayed image file to the book file. In the present embodiment the images contained in the image file other than the images corresponding to the first and last pages have the two page spread relationship.

The judgment of the size of the document may be executed based on a resolution and the number of pixels of each of the images based on the image data for example. Here this judgment is explained assuming that the image has X pixels along its short sides and Y pixels along its long sides and has a resolution of a dpi dots per inch . In this case a length of the document along its short sides is X a inches while a length of the document along its long sides is Y a inches. Meanwhile a length of the A4 size along its short sides is about 8.27 inches while a length of the A4 size along its long sides is about 11.69 inches. Therefore the CPU needs to judge whether each of the lengths of the document along its short sides and long sides is shorter than a corresponding one of the lengths of the A4 size along its short sides and long sides. Where the size of the document is equal to or smaller than the A4 size S YES the plurality of images contained in the image file are judged to have the two page spread relationship and the processing goes to S at which the CPU sets the file type flag to the book file. Upon completion of S the book file determination processing ends. It is noted that the CPU at S judges that the to be displayed image file contains the additional information according to Exit and the additional information contains the information that the image file is the book file the CPU judges that the plurality of images contained in the to be displayed image file have the two page spread relationship. In this case the CPU sets the file type flag of the to be displayed image file to the book file.

On the other hand where the size of the document is larger than the A4 size S NO the CPU judges that the image file is a file that is different from the book file and this flow goes to S at which the CPU sets the file type flag to file different from book file . Upon completion of S the book file determination processing ends.

Returning now to the flow in the CPU at S judges whether the to be displayed image file is the book file. Specifically the CPU reads the file type flag to execute this judgment. Where the to be displayed image file is the book file S YES this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU judges whether the selected image G being indicated or selected by the selected image page number is a front or top image i.e. a front or top page in the image file. Where the selected image G is not the front image S NO this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU displays the selected image G and an associated image G on the panel in a two page spread layout. The associated image G is an image which is associated with the selected image G and whose page number follows or precedes that of the selected image G. In other words the page number of the selected image G is consecutive to that of the associated image G. The two page spread layout is a layout as shown in in which the selected image G and the associated image are displayed on the panel such that the selected image G is displayed as an image for one of the right and left pages while the associated image G is displayed as an image for the other of the right and left pages. It is noted that shows one example of the display in which the selected image G and the associated image G are displayed in the two page spread layout on the panel being in the vertical orientation. shows another example of the display in which the selected image G and the associated image G are displayed in the two page spread layout on the panel being in the horizontal orientation.

At S the CPU judges whether the user has performed a displayed page change operation which includes an operation to move forward the current page to the next page and an operation to move back the current page to the preceding page. For example the user performs the displayed page change operation by a flick operation on the panel . When the displayed page change operation has not been performed S NO this flow repeats S and when the displayed page change operation is performed S YES this flow goes to S at which the CPU executes a displayed page change processing. Specifically when the CPU moves forward the current page to the next page the CPU adds 2 to a current selected image page number. When the CPU moves back the current page to the preceding page the CPU subtracts 2 from the current selected image page number. Upon completion of S this flow goes to S.

On the other hand when the CPU at S judges that the selected image G being indicated by the selected image page number is the front image i.e. the front page in the image file S YES this flow goes to S. At S the CPU displays only the selected image G on the panel in the one page layout that differs from the two page spread layout. The one page layout is a layout as shown in in which only the selected image G is displayed on the panel . A book is often designed such that a front cover i.e. a front or first page is in the one page layout and second and subsequent pages are in the two page spread layout. In the present embodiment the image of the front page is displayed in the one page layout whereby the display layout of the images contained in the image file corresponds to the layout of the book. It is noted that shows one example of the display in which the selected image G is displayed in the one page layout on the panel being in the vertical orientation. shows another example of the display in which the selected image G is displayed in the one page layout on the panel being in the horizontal orientation.

At S the CPU judges whether the user has performed the displayed page change operation. When the displayed page change operation has not been performed S NO this flow repeats S and when the displayed page change operation is performed S YES this flow goes to S at which the CPU executes the displayed page change processing. Specifically when the CPU moves forward the current page to the next page the CPU adds 1 to the current selected image page number. When the CPU moves back the current page to the preceding page the CPU subtracts 1 from the current selected image page number. Upon completion of S this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU judges whether the image file contains an image that corresponds to the selected image page number changed by the displayed page change operation. Where the image file contains the image of interest S YES this flow returns to S and where the image file does not contain the image of interest S NO this flow goes to S. At S the CPU displays a message Front Page or Last Page on the panel and this flow ends.

On the other hand where the CPU at S judges that the to be displayed image file is not the book file S NO this flow goes to S shown in . At S the CPU judges whether the panel of the mobile phone is in the horizontal orientation. Specifically the CPU uses the API to obtain from the inclination sensor sensor information indicative of an inclination of a housing of the mobile phone . The CPU then judges based on the sensor information which of the horizontal direction and the direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction is nearer to a direction along the long sides of the panel . Where the panel is in the horizontal orientation S YES this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU displays the selected image G and the associated image G in the two page spread layout. In this case as shown in the selected image G and the associated image G are displayed on the panel being in the horizontal orientation.

At S the CPU judges whether the user has performed the displayed page change operation. At S the CPU executes the displayed page change processing. It is noted that the processings in S and S are respectively similar to the above described processings in S and S and an explanation thereof is omitted.

On the other hand where the CPU at S judges that the panel is in the vertical orientation S NO this flow goes to S. At S the CPU displays only the selected image G in the one page layout. In this case as shown in only the selected image G is displayed on the panel being in the vertical orientation. Also since the selected image G is the portrait image the selected image G can be displayed in larger size in the case where the selected image G is displayed on the panel being in the vertical orientation as shown in than in the case where the selected image G is displayed on the panel being in the horizontal orientation as shown in . At S the CPU judges whether the user has performed the displayed page change operation. At S the CPU executes the displayed page change processing. It is noted that the processings in S and S are respectively similar to the above described processings in S and S and an explanation thereof is omitted.

At S the CPU judges whether the image file contains an image that corresponds to the selected image page number changed by the displayed page change operation. Where the image file contains the image of interest S YES this flow returns to S and where the image file does not contain the image of interest S NO this flow goes to S. At S the CPU displays the message Front Page or Last Page on the panel and this flow ends 

There will be next explained effects of the mobile phone according to the first embodiment. In the mobile phone according to the first embodiment where the to be displayed image file is the book file S YES the selected image G and the associated image G are displayed at S on the panel in the two page spread layout as shown in . Also where the to be displayed image file is not the book file S NO only the selected image G is displayed at S on the panel in the one page layout as shown in . That is the number of the images displayed on the panel can be automatically changed depending upon whether the to be displayed image file is the book file. Therefore the plurality of images can be displayed on the panel in such a layout that the user can view or recognize the images most easily which enhances convenience for the user.

In the mobile phone according to the first embodiment the CPU at S judges whether the to be displayed image file is the book file on the basis of the size of the document used for the creation of the images contained in the to be displayed image file. Therefore the CPU can judge whether the to be displayed image file is the book file by the simple processing.

In the mobile phone according to the first embodiment where the to be displayed image file is the book file S YES when the image of the front page is displayed S YES only the image of the front page is displayed at S an the panel in the one page layout as shown in . Also when the images of the second and subsequent pages are displayed S NO the selected image G and the associated image G are displayed at S on the panel in the two page spread layout as shown in . When the portrait image or images are displayed on the panel being in the vertical orientation each image can be displayed in larger size in the case where the one image is displayed in the one page layout as shown in than in the case where the two images are displayed in the two page spread layout as shown in . Therefore the images can be displayed such that the image of the front page that is not displayed in the two page spread layout is displayed in relatively large size and the images to be displayed in the two page spread layout are displayed so as to be arranged side by side.

In the mobile phone according to the first embodiment even where the to be displayed image file is not the book file S NO where the panel is in the horizontal orientation S YES the two images are displayed next to each other at S as shown in . Since the largest size of each image to be displayed is determined by the short sides of the panel being in the horizontal orientation when the portrait image or images are displayed on the panel being in the horizontal orientation a larger number of images having the same size can be displayed in the case where the two images are displayed as shown in than in the case where the one image is displayed as shown in .

At S the CPU judges which of the plurality of image files stored in the image file storage area has been selected as the to be displayed image file. When the to be displayed image file has not been selected S NO this flow repeats S and when the to be displayed image file is selected S YES this flow goes to S. At S the CPU sets the selected image page number to 1 . At S the CPU executes the book file determination processing. It is noted that the book file determination processing at S is similar to that in S in and an explanation thereof is omitted.

At S the CPU judges based on the file type flag whether the to be displayed image file is the book file. Where the to be displayed image file is not the book file S NO this flow goes to S at which the CPU displays only the selected image G in the one page layout. At S the CPU judges whether the user has performed the displayed page change operation. At S the CPU executes the displayed page change processing. Upon completion of S this flow goes to S. It is noted that the processings in S S and S are respectively similar to the above described processings in S S and S and an explanation thereof is omitted.

On the other hand where the to be displayed image file is the book file S YES this flow goes to S. At S the CPU executes an optical character recognition processing hereinafter referred to as OCR processing on the selected image G being indicated by the selected image page number. In this OCR processing it is recognized that texts contained in the selected image G are written vertically or horizontally. In other words it is recognized that a direction of arrangement of the texts is the vertical direction or horizontal direction. In the OCR processing the page number displayed on the selected image G is also recognized. It is noted that this OCR processing uses a common method and an explanation thereof is omitted.

At S in the CPU judges whether the page number of the selected image G recognized in the OCR processing is an even number.

Specifically the CPU displays the selected image G and the associated image G such that the selected image G of the even number page having the smaller page number is displayed on the left side while the associated image G of the odd number page having the larger page number is displayed on the right side.

On the other hand when the CPU at S judges that the page number of the selected image G recognized in the OCR processing is an odd number S NO this flow goes to S. At S the CPU judges based on the result of the OCR processing whether the texts contained in the selected image G are written horizontally. Where the texts are written vertically S NO this flow goes to S.

At S the CPU displays the selected image G and the associated image G on the panel in the right binding two page spread layout. In this layout one of the selected image G and the associated image G which one has a smaller page number than that of the other image is located on a right side of the other image.

On the other hand when the CPU at S judges that the texts are written horizontally S YES this flow goes to S. At S the CPU displays the selected image G and the associated image G on the panel in the left binding two page spread layout. In this layout one of the selected image G and the associated image G which one has a smaller page number than that of the other image is located on a left side of the other image. Specifically the CPU displays the selected image G and the associated image G such that the associated image G of the even number page having the smaller page number is displayed on the left side while the selected image G of the odd number page having the larger page number is displayed on the right side.

At S the CPU judges whether the user has performed the displayed page change operation. At S the CPU executes the displayed page change processing. It is noted that the processings in S and S are respectively similar to the above described processings in S and S and an explanation thereof is omitted.

At S the CPU judges whether the image file contains an image that corresponds to the selected image page number changed by the displayed page change operation. Where the image file contains the image of interest S YES this flow returns to S and where the image file does not contain the image of interest S NO this flow goes to S. At S the CPU displays the message Front Page or Last Page on the panel and this flow ends.
