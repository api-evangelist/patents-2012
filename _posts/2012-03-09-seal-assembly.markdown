In the example shown liner section comprises a forward exhaust liner section liner section comprises an intermediate exhaust liner section and element comprises a rearward exhaust liner section. Between each pair of adjacent exhaust liner sections is a seal assembly . The seal assembly comprises a seal carrier a seal body and a resilient member as shown in . The seal body slides relative to the seal carrier to expand and contract as the resilient member is compressed or expanded. The seal carrier and seal body comprise annular members that define a center axis A. In the example shown the resilient member comprises a wave spring however other types of springs could also be used. Further while a single resilient member is shown a plurality of resilient members could also be installed between the seal carrier and seal body .

The prior art seal assembly of includes a seal carrier a seal body and a resilient member . The seal carrier is L shaped in cross section and the seal body is U shaped in cross section. The seal carrier includes a first leg that is fixed to the first plate and a second leg that extends toward the seal body . The first leg is shorter than the second leg . The seal body includes a first leg and a second leg that are connected to each other by a base portion to form the U shape. The base portion slides on top of the second leg of the seal carrier to define a plane of travel.

The first leg abuts against the second plate . The resilient member has a first end that reacts against the first leg of the seal carrier at the first plate and a second end that reacts against the second leg of the seal body . The resilient member pre loads the seal body against the second plate . A retainer has a first portion fixed to the first plate and an arm portion that extends over the resilient member and overlaps the second leg and at least a portion of the base portion of the seal body . The retainer prevents the resilient member and seal body from dis assembling from the second plate .

This configuration has several disadvantages. First there is a lack of sufficient axial travel length between the seal body and the seal carrier as the resilient member moves between retracted and expanded positions. Second there is a tendency for the resilient member to rotate causing the resilient member to slide underneath the seal body along the plane of travel.

The seal assembly of provides a configuration with increased travel and positive spring retention all within the same amount of packaging space as that of . As discussed above the seal assembly includes a seal carrier a seal body and a resilient member . The seal body slides relative to the seal carrier to expand and contract the joint as the resilient member is compressed or expanded. The seal carrier and seal body comprise annular members that define a center axis A.

The seal carrier is mounted to the first plate and the seal body overlaps at least a portion of the seal carrier to define a plane of travel P between the seal body and the seal carrier . The plane of travel P comprises an area of sliding contact along an axial direction between the seal body and seal carrier . The resilient member is configured to bias the seal body against the second plate . The seal carrier includes an indented portion that extends radially inward of the plane of travel P.

The seal carrier comprises a carrier body having a first linear portion fixed to the first plate and a second linear portion in sliding engagement with the seal body along the plane of travel P. The indented portion provides a transition between the first and second linear portions.

The carrier body includes an inner surface facing the center axis A and an outer surface facing away from the center axis A. The distance between the inner surface and the outer surface defines the thickness of the carrier body . The outer surface at the indented portion is spaced radially inwardly toward the center axis A and away from the plane of travel P by a distance D. The indented portion comprises a U shape where a bottom of the U shape is radially closer to the center axis A than the first and second linear portions.

The first and second linear portions are orientated transversely relative to each other. In one example the first linear portion is generally perpendicular to the second linear portion .

The seal body comprises a J shape. The J shape comprises a first leg biased against the second plate a second leg sliding along the plane of travel P and a radiused portion R transitioning between the legs . The first leg is shorter than the second leg . The seal body has an outer surface and an inner surface that are separated by a seal thickness. The inner surface of the second leg rests directly on top of the outer surface of the carrier body . The second leg of the seal body slides along the fixed second linear portion of the carrier body as the resilient member moves between contracted and expanded positions.

A clip is fixed to the seal body such that the clip and seal body move together as a unitary piece. In one example the clip is brazed or welded to the seal body however other attachment methods could also be used. The resilient member has a first end reacting against the first linear portion of the carrier body at the first plate and a second end reacting against the clip .

The clip includes a first linear portion that is spaced apart from and generally parallel to the first plate and a second linear portion that is fixed to the outer surface of the seal body . An S shaped connecting portion connects the first linear portion to the second linear portion . The S shaped connecting portion forms a concave pocket area that receives the second end of the resilient member . Thus the S shaped connecting portion prevents the resilient member from moving away from the seal carrier in a radial direction.

A retainer has a base portion fixed to the first plate and an arm portion that extends outwardly from the base portion over the resilient member and further extends to overlap at least a portion of the clip . The arm portion extends generally parallel to the second linear portion of the carrier body . A distal end portion of the arm portion extends radially inwardly toward the axis A. The distal end portion is spaced apart from and axially faces the first linear portion of the clip .

The seal carrier includes a plurality of holes configured to meter flow into an exhaust gas flow path through the gap . In one example the plurality of holes is formed within the indented portion . The holes are circumferentially spaced apart from each other about the axis A. Flow from a bypass flow B is directed through the holes and into a core flow C. The forward exhaust liner section and the intermediate exhaust liner section define the exhaust gas flow path which comprises the core flow C. In one example the liner sections form part of the augmentor section of an engine. The bypass flow B flows externally to these liner sections.

In another example the bypass flow path B is provided external to connecting sections of a gas turbine engine and is defined within a fan nacelle schematically indicated at of a commercial engine. The bypass flow B is between an inner surface of the fan nacelle and an outer surface of the connecting sections . In one example the seal assembly is used in a variable area nozzle of the engine.

The configuration of offers several advantages over the configuration shown in . The resilient member is effectively captured by the seal body and clip . By locating the second end of the resilient member in the pocket i.e. in an area between a bottom surface of the clip and the outer surface of the seal body the resilient member cannot slide underneath the seal body .

The J section of the seal body allows increased travel in combination with positive retention. There is no longer wasted space in the radius. Further there is increased travel in both the expansion and contraction directions. Moving the radius of the seal carrier radially inwardly by the distance D i.e. providing the indented portion increases compression travel distance while eliminating the back radius portion leg of the prior seal configuration increases expansion travel distance as there is less of a tendency for the spring to ride underneath this portion of the seal.

Additionally the indented portion of the seal carrier i.e. the dropped radius portion on the seal carrier allows full motion to backing plane with no interference in the bend radius. Further the metered flow control holes in the indented portion can be used to purge internal cavities.

Although an example embodiment has been disclosed a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of the claims. For that reason the following claims should be studied to determine their true scope and content.
