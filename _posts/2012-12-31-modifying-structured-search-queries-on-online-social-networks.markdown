This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

In particular embodiments in response to a text query received from a user a social networking system may generate structured queries comprising query tokens that correspond to identified social graph elements. By providing suggested structured queries in response to a user s text query the social networking system may provide a powerful way for users of an online social network to search for elements represented in a social graph based on their social graph attributes and their relation to various social graph elements.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may receive an unstructured text query from a user. In response the social networking system may access a social graph and then parse the text query to identify social graph elements that corresponded to n grams from the text query. The social networking system may then access a grammar model such as a context free grammar model. The identified social graph elements may be used as terminal tokens query tokens in the grammars of the grammar model. Any grammar that can utilize all of the identified query tokens may be selected. These grammars may be identified by first generating a semantic tree corresponding to the text query and then analyzing a grammar forest to find sub trees that match the semantic tree. The selected grammars may then be used to generate natural language structured queries that include query tokens referencing the identified social graph elements. The structured queries may then be transmitted and displayed to the user where the user can then select an appropriate query to search for the desired content.

In particular embodiments in response to a structured query the social networking system may generate one or more search results corresponding to the structured query. These search results may be transmitted to the querying user as part of a search results page. Each search result may include one or more snippets where the snippet may be contextual information about social graph entity that corresponds to the search result. For example a snippet may be information from the profile page associated with a node. Each search result may also include at least one snippet providing social graph information for the search result. These snippets may contain references to the query tokens from the structured query used to generate the search result.

In particular embodiments in response to a structured query the social networking system may generate one or more query modifications for the structured query. Each query modification may include references to modified nodes or modified edges from the social graph which may be used to add or replace query tokens in the structured query. The query modifications may be displayed on the search results page allowing a user to view the search results and then select one or more query modifications to refine or pivot the structured query and generate new search results. After modifying a structured query with a particular query modification an appropriate grammar may be used to generate a new natural language structured query that includes reference to the social graph elements used in the query modification. The social networking system may also generate alternative structured queries that may be displayed on the search results page. These alternative structured queries include suggested queries broadening queries and disambiguation queries.

As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system . In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments an advertisement may be text which may be HTML linked one or more images which may be HTML linked one or more videos audio one or more ADOBE FLASH files a suitable combination of these or any other suitable advertisement in any suitable digital format presented on one or more webpages in one or more e mails or in connection with search results requested by a user . In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may be one or more sponsored stories e.g. a news feed or ticker item on social networking system . A sponsored story may be a social action by a user such as liking a page liking or commenting on a post on a page RSVPing to an event associated with a page voting on a question posted on a page checking in to a place using an application or playing a game or liking or sharing a website that an advertiser promotes by for example having the social action presented within a pre determined area of a profile page of a user or other page presented with additional information associated with the advertiser bumped up or otherwise highlighted within news feeds or tickers of other users or otherwise promoted. The advertiser may pay to have the social action promoted.

In particular embodiments an advertisement may be requested for display within social networking system webpages third party webpages or other pages. An advertisement may be displayed in a dedicated portion of a page such as in a banner area at the top of the page in a column at the side of the page in a GUI of the page in a pop up window in a drop down menu in an input field of the page over the top of content of the page or elsewhere with respect to the page. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may be displayed within an application. An advertisement may be displayed within dedicated pages requiring the user to interact with or watch the advertisement before the user may access a page or utilize an application. The user may for example view the advertisement through a web browser.

A user may interact with an advertisement in any suitable manner. The user may click or otherwise select the advertisement. By selecting the advertisement the user may be directed to or a browser or other application being used by the user a page associated with the advertisement. At the page associated with the advertisement the user may take additional actions such as purchasing a product or service associated with the advertisement receiving information associated with the advertisement or subscribing to a newsletter associated with the advertisement. An advertisement with audio or video may be played by selecting a component of the advertisement like a play button . Alternatively by selecting the advertisement the social networking system may execute or modify a particular action of the user. As an example and not by way of limitation advertisements may be included among the search results of a search results page where sponsored content is promoted over non sponsored content. As another example and not by way of limitation advertisements may be included among suggested search query where suggested queries that reference the advertiser or its content products may be promoted over non sponsored queries.

An advertisement may include social networking system functionality that a user may interact with. For example an advertisement may enable a user to like or otherwise endorse the advertisement by selecting an icon or link associated with endorsement. As another example an advertisement may enable a user to search e.g. by executing a query for content related to the advertiser. Similarly a user may share the advertisement with another user e.g. through social networking system or RSVP e.g. through social networking system to an event associated with the advertisement. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may include social networking system context directed to the user. For example an advertisement may display information about a friend of the user within social networking system who has taken an action associated with the subject matter of the advertisement.

In particular embodiments one or more client side and or backend server side processes may implement and utilize a typeahead feature that may automatically attempt to match social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges to information currently being entered by a user in an input form rendered in conjunction with a requested webpage such as for example a user profile page a concept profile page a search results webpage or another suitable page of the online social network which may be hosted by or accessible in the social networking system . In particular embodiments as a user is entering text to make a declaration the typeahead feature may attempt to match the string of textual characters being entered in the declaration to strings of characters e.g. names descriptions corresponding to user concepts or edges and their corresponding elements in the social graph . In particular embodiments when a match is found the typeahead feature may automatically populate the form with a reference to the social graph element such as for example the node name type node ID edge name type edge ID or another suitable reference or identifier of the existing social graph element.

In particular embodiments as a user types or otherwise enters text into a form used to add content or make declarations in various sections of the user s profile page home page or other page the typeahead process may work in conjunction with one or more frontend client side and or backend server side typeahead processes hereinafter referred to simply as typeahead process executing at or within the social networking system e.g. within servers to interactively and virtually instantaneously as appearing to the user attempt to auto populate the form with a term or terms corresponding to names of existing social graph elements or terms associated with existing social graph elements determined to be the most relevant or best match to the characters of text entered by the user as the user enters the characters of text. Utilizing the social graph information in a social graph database or information extracted and indexed from the social graph database including information associated with nodes and edges the typeahead processes in conjunction with the information from the social graph database as well as potentially in conjunction with various others processes applications or databases located within or executing within social networking system may be able to predict a user s intended declaration with a high degree of precision. However the social networking system can also provides user s with the freedom to enter essentially any declaration they wish enabling users to express themselves freely.

In particular embodiments as a user enters text characters into a form box or other field the typeahead processes may attempt to identify existing social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered in the user s declaration as the user is entering the characters. In particular embodiments as the user enters characters into a form box the typeahead process may read the string of entered textual characters. As each keystroke is made the frontend typeahead process may transmit the entered character string as a request or call to the backend typeahead process executing within social networking system . In particular embodiments the typeahead processes may communicate via AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or other suitable techniques and particularly asynchronous techniques. In particular embodiments the request may be or comprise an XMLHTTPRequest XHR enabling quick and dynamic sending and fetching of results. In particular embodiments the typeahead process may also transmit before after or with the request a section identifier section ID that identifies the particular section of the particular page in which the user is making the declaration. In particular embodiments a user ID parameter may also be sent but this may be unnecessary in some embodiments as the user may already be known based on the user having logged into or otherwise been authenticated by the social networking system .

In particular embodiments the typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching social graph elements. In particular embodiments when a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings or descriptions of the matching social graph elements as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user entering the characters pok into a query field the typeahead process may display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes such as a profile page named or devoted to poker or pokemon which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to declare the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node. As another example and not by way of limitation upon clicking poker the typeahead process may auto populate or causes the web browser to auto populate the query field with the declaration poker . In particular embodiments the typeahead process may simply auto populate the field with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu. The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on his or her keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration.

More information on typeahead processes may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 162 filed 19 Apr. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the typeahead processes described herein may be applied to search queries entered by a user. As an example and not by way of limitation as a user enters text characters into a search field a typeahead process may attempt to identify one or more user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered search field as the user is entering the characters. As the typeahead process receives requests or calls including a string or n gram from the text query the typeahead process may perform or causes to be performed a search to identify existing social graph elements i.e. user nodes concept nodes edges having respective names types categories or other identifiers matching the entered text. The typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching nodes or edges. When a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the matching nodes as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching nodes. The typeahead process may then display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes and displays names of matching edges that may connect to the matching user nodes or concept nodes which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to search for the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node or to search for users or concepts connected to the matched users or concepts by the matching edges. Alternatively the typeahead process may simply auto populate the form with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu . The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on a keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration. Upon user confirmation of the matching nodes and edges the typeahead process may transmit a request that informs the social networking system of the user s confirmation of a query containing the matching social graph elements. In response to the request transmitted the social networking system may automatically or alternately based on an instruction in the request call or otherwise search a social graph database for the matching social graph elements or for social graph elements connected to the matching social graph elements as appropriate. Although this disclosure describes applying the typeahead processes to search queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates applying the typeahead processes to search queries in any suitable manner.

In connection with search queries and search results particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node an unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into query field as illustrated in . As the first user enters this text query into query field the social networking system may provide various suggested structured queries as illustrated in drop down menus . As used herein an unstructured text query refers to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simple text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Furthermore the text query may be unstructured with respect to formal query syntax. In other words a simple text query will not necessarily be in the format of a query command that is directly executable by a search engine. Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may parse the unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends stanford to identify the following n grams friends stanford friends stanford. As another example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends in palo alto to identify the following n grams friends in palo alto friends in in palo palo alto friend in palo in palo also friends in palo alto. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the text query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine or calculate for each n gram identified in the text query a score that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a probability score also referred to simply as a probability that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element such as a user node a concept node or an edge of social graph . The probability score may indicate the level of similarity or relevance between the n gram and a particular social graph element. There may be many different ways to calculate the probability. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable method to calculate a probability score for an n gram identified in a search query. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. The probability p may be calculated as the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X. In other words the probability may be calculated as p k X . As an example and not by way of limitation a probability that an n gram corresponds to a social graph element may calculated as an probability score denoted as p. The input may be a text query X x x . . . x and a set of classes. For each i j and a class k the social networking system may compute p p class x k X . As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford California 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. As another example and not by way of limitation the n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. In particular embodiments the social networking system may user a forward backward algorithm to determine the probability that a particular n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. For a given n gram within a text query the social networking system may use both the preceding and succeeding n grams to determine which particular social graph elements correspond to the given n gram. In particular embodiments the identified social graph elements may be used to generate a query command that is executable by a search engine. The query command may be a structured semantic query with defined functions that accept specific arguments. As an example and not by way of limitation the text query friend me mark could be parsed to form the query command intersect friend me friend Mark . In other words the query is looking for nodes in the social graph that intersect the querying user me and the user Mark i.e. those user nodes that are connected to both the user node of the querying user by a friend type edge and the user node for the user Mark by a friend type edge . Although this disclosure describes determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using a particular type of score this disclosure contemplates determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using any suitable type of score.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more edges having a probability greater than an edge threshold probability. Each of the identified edges may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to an edge k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified edges may be connected to at least one of the identified nodes. In other words the social networking system may only identify edges or edge types that are connected to user nodes or concept nodes that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Edges or edge types that are not connected to any previously identified node are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these edges and edge types the social networking system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing for a text query containing went to Stanford where an identified concept node is the school Stanford the social networking system may identify the edges corresponding to worked at and the edges corresponding to attended both of which are connected to the concept node for Stanford. Thus the n gram went to may be identified as corresponding to these edges . However for the same text query the social networking system may not identify the edges corresponding to like or fan in the social graph because the Stanford node does not have any such edges connected to it. Although this disclosure describes identifying edges that correspond to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying edges that correspond to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more user nodes or concept nodes having a probability greater than a node threshold probability. Each of the identified nodes may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to a node k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified user nodes or concept nodes may be connected to at least one of the identified edges . In other words the social networking system may only identify nodes or nodes types that are connected to edges that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Nodes or node types that are not connected to any previously identified edges are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these nodes and node types the social networking system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation for a text query containing worked at Apple where an identified edge is worked at the social networking system may identify the concept node corresponding to the company APPLE INC. which may have multiple edges of worked at connected to it. However for the same text query the social networking system may not identify the concept node corresponding to the fruit type apple which may have multiple like or fan edges connected to it but no worked at edge connections. In particular embodiments the node threshold probability may differ for user nodes and concept nodes and may differ even among these nodes e.g. some concept nodes may have different node threshold probabilities than other concept nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an n gram may be identified as corresponding to a user node k if p p while an n gram may be identified as corresponding to a concept node k if p p. In particular embodiments the social networking system may only identify nodes that are within a threshold degree of separation of the user node corresponding to the first user i.e. the querying user . The threshold degree of separation may be for example one two three or all. Although this disclosure describes identifying nodes that correspond to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying nodes that correspond to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may access a context free grammar model comprising a plurality of grammars. Each grammar of the grammar model may comprise one or more non terminal tokens or non terminal symbols and one or more terminal tokens or terminal symbols query tokens where particular non terminal tokens may be replaced by terminal tokens. A grammar model is a set of formation rules for strings in a formal language. In particular embodiments the plurality of grammars may be visualized as a grammar forest organized as an ordered tree with the internal nodes corresponding to non terminal tokens and the leaf nodes corresponding to terminal tokens. Each grammar may be represented as a sub tree within the grammar forest where the grammars are adjoining each other via non terminal tokens. Thus two or more grammars may be a sub forest within the grammar forest. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular grammars this disclosure contemplates any suitable grammars.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more strings using one or more grammars. To generate a string in the language one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol. The production rules are then applied in any order until a string that contains neither the start symbol nor designated non terminal symbols is produced. In a context free grammar the production of each non terminal symbol of the grammar is independent of what is produced by other non terminal symbols of the grammar. The non terminal symbols may be replaced with terminal symbols i.e. terminal tokens or query tokens . Some of the query tokens may correspond to identified nodes or identified edges as described previously. A string generated by the grammar may then be used as the basis for a structured query containing references to the identified nodes or identified edges. The string generated by the grammar may be rendered in a natural language syntax such that a structured query based on the string is also rendered in natural language. A context free grammar is a grammar in which the left hand side of each production rule consists of only a single non terminal symbol. A probabilistic context free grammar is a tuple N S P where the disjoint sets and N specify the terminal and non terminal symbols respectively with S N being the start symbol. P is the set of productions which take the form E p with E N N and p PR E the probability that E will be expanded into the string . The sum of probabilities p over all expansions of a given non terminal E must be one. Although this disclosure describes generating strings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating strings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may identify one or more query tokens corresponding to the previously identified nodes and edges. In other words if an identified node or identified edge may be used as a query token in a particular grammar that query token may be identified by the social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation an example grammar may be user user filter school . The non terminal symbols user user filter and school could then be determined based n grams in the received text query. For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar as for example friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . As another example and not by way of limitation an example grammar may be user user filter location . For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar as for example friends who live in Stanford California . In both the example cases above if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens then these query tokens may be identified by the social networking system . Although this disclosure describes identifying particular query tokens in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable query tokens in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may select one or more grammars having at least one query token corresponding to each of the previously identified nodes and edges. Only particular grammars may be used depending on the n grams identified in the text query. So the terminal tokens of all available grammars should be examined to find those that match the identified n grams from the text query. In other words if a particular grammar can use all of the identified nodes and edges as query tokens that grammar may be selected by the social networking system as a possible grammar to use for generating a structured query. This is effectively a type of bottom up parsing where the possible query tokens are used to determine the applicable grammar to apply to the query. As an example and not by way of limitation for the text query friends stanford the social networking system may identify the query tokens of friends and Stanford University . Terminal tokens of the grammars from the grammar model may be identified as previously discussed. Any grammar that is able to use both the friends and the Stanford University tokens may then be selected. For example the grammar user user filter school may be selected because this grammar could use the friends and the Stanford University tokens as query tokens such as by forming the strings friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . Thus if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens in the grammars then these grammars may be selected by the social networking system . Similarly if the received text query comprises n grams that could not be used as query tokens in the grammar that grammar may not be selected. Although this disclosure describes selecting particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may select one or more grammars by analyzing a grammar forest formed by a plurality of grammars. The grammar forest may be organized as an ordered tree comprising a plurality of non terminal tokens and a plurality of terminal tokens. Each grammar may be represented as a sub tree within the grammar forest and each sub tree may adjoin other sub trees via one or more additional non terminal tokens. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may start by identifying all the terminal tokens i.e. query tokens in the grammar forest that correspond to identified nodes and edges corresponding to portions of a text query. Once these query tokens in the grammar forest have been identified the social networking system may then traverse the grammar forest up from each of these query tokens to identify one or more intersecting non terminal tokens. Once a non terminal token has been identified where paths from all the query tokens intersect that intersecting non terminal token may be selected and the one or more grammars adjoined to that intersecting non terminal token in the grammar forest may then be selected. Although this disclosure describes selecting grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for each selected grammar. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. The score may be based on the individual scores or probabilities associated with the query tokens used in the selected grammar. A grammar may have a higher relative score if it uses query tokens with relatively higher individual scores. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior examples the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford California 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. The n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. Thus the grammar user user filter school may have a relatively high score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the school Stanford University generating for example the string friends who go to Stanford University both of which have relatively high individual scores. In contrast the grammar user user filter user may have relatively low score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the user Allen Stanford generating for example the string friends of Allen Stanford since the latter query token has a relatively low individual score. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a selected grammar based on the lengths of the paths traversed in order to identify the intersect token corresponding to the selected grammar. Grammars with lower cost multi paths i.e. shorter paths may be scored more highly than grammars with high cost multi paths i.e. longer paths . In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a selected grammar based on advertising sponsorship. An advertiser such as for example the user or administrator of a particular profile page corresponding to a particular node may sponsor a particular node such that a grammar that includes a query token referencing that sponsored node may be scored more highly. Although this disclosure describes determining particular scores for particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable scores for any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine the score for a selected grammar based on the relevance of the social graph elements corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar to the querying user i.e. the first user corresponding to a first user node . User nodes and concept nodes that are connected to the first user node directly by an edge may be considered relevant to the first user. Thus grammars comprising query tokens corresponding to these relevant nodes and edges may be considered more relevant to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept node connected by an edge to a first user node may be considered relevant to the first user node . As used herein when referencing a social graph the term connected means a path exists within the social graph between two nodes wherein the path may comprise one or more edges and zero or more intermediary nodes. In particular embodiments nodes that are connected to the first user node via one or more intervening nodes and therefore two or more edges may also be considered relevant to the first user. Furthermore in particular embodiments the closer the second node is to the first user node the more relevant the second node may be considered to the first user node. That is the fewer edges separating the first user node from a particular user node or concept node i.e. the fewer degrees of separation the more relevant that user node or concept node may be considered to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford is connected to the user node corresponding to User C and thus the concept Stanford may be considered relevant to User C. As another example and not by way of limitation the user node corresponding to User A is connected to the user node corresponding to User C via one intermediate node and two edges i.e. the intermediated user node corresponding to User B and thus User A may be considered relevant to User C but because the user node for User A is a second degree connection with respect to User C that particular concept node may be considered less relevant than a user node that is connected to the user node for User C by a single edge such as for example the user node corresponding to User B. As yet another example and not by way of limitation the concept node for Online Poker which may correspond to an online multiplayer game is not connected to the user node for User C by any pathway in social graph and thus the concept Online Poker may not be considered relevant to User C. In particular embodiments a second node may only be considered relevant to the first user if the second node is within a threshold degree of separation of the first user node . As an example and not by way of limitation if the threshold degree of separation is three then the user node corresponding to User D may be considered relevant to the concept node corresponding to the recipe Chicken Parmesan which are within three degrees of each other on social graph illustrated in . However continuing with this example the concept node corresponding to the application All About Recipes would not be considered relevant to the user node corresponding to User D because these nodes are four degrees apart in the social graph . Although this disclosure describes determining whether particular social graph elements and thus their corresponding query tokens are relevant to each other in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether any suitable social graph elements are relevant to each other in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether particular query tokens corresponding to user nodes and concept nodes are relevant to a querying user this disclosure contemplates similarly determining whether any suitable query token and thus any suitable node is relevant to any other suitable user.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine the score for a selected grammar based social graph information corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation when determining a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element the calculation of the probability may also factor in social graph information. Thus the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X and social graph information G may be calculated as p k X G . The individual probabilities for the identified nodes and edges may then be used to determine the score for a grammar using those social graph elements as query tokens. In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the degree of separation between the first user node and the particular social graph element used as a query token in the grammar. Grammars with query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are closer in the social graph to the querying user i.e. fewer degrees of separation between the element and the first user node may be scored more highly than grammars using query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are further from the user i.e. more degrees of separation . As an example and not by way of limitation referencing if user B inputs a text query of chicken a grammar with a query token corresponding to the concept node for the recipe Chicken Parmesan which is connected to user B by an edge may have a relatively higher score than a grammar with a query token corresponding to other nodes associated with the n gram chicken e.g. concept nodes corresponding to chicken nuggets or funky chicken dance that are not connected to user B in the social graph . In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the identified edges corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. If the social networking system has already identified one or more edges that correspond to n grams in a received text query those identified edges may then be considered when determining the score for a particular parsing of the text query by the grammar. If a particular grammar comprises query tokens that correspond to both identified nodes and identified edges if the identified nodes are not actually connected to any of the identified edges that particular grammar may be assigned a zero or null score. In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the number of edges connected to the nodes corresponding to query tokens of the grammar. Grammars comprising query tokens that corresponding to nodes with more connecting edges may be more popular and more likely to be a target of a search query. As an example and not by way of limitation if the concept node for Stanford California is only connected by five edges while the concept node for Stanford University is connected by five thousand edges when determining the score for grammars containing query tokens corresponding to either of these nodes the social networking system may determine that the grammar with a query token corresponding to the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively higher score than a grammar referencing the concept node for Stanford California because of the greater number of edges connected to the former concept node . In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the search history associate with the first user i.e. the querying user . Grammars with query tokens corresponding to nodes that the first user has previously accessed or are relevant to the nodes the first user has previously accessed may be more likely to be the target of the first user s search query. Thus these grammars may be given a higher score. As an example and not by way of limitation if first user has previously visited the Stanford University profile page but has never visited the Stanford California profile page when determining the score for grammars with query tokens corresponding to these concepts the social networking system may determine that the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively high score and thus the grammar using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for the school. As another example and not by way of limitation if the first user has previously visited the concept profile page for the television show Friends when determining the score for the grammar with the query token corresponding to that concept the social networking system may determine that the concept node corresponding to the television show Friends has a relatively high score and thus the grammar using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for that television show. Although this disclosure describes determining scores for particular grammars based on particular social graph information in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining scores for any suitable grammars based on any suitable social graph information in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may select one or more grammars having a score greater than a grammar threshold score. Each of the selected grammars may contain query tokens that correspond to each of the identified nodes or identified edges which correspond to n grams of the received text query . In particular embodiments the grammars may be ranked based on their determined scores and only grammars within a threshold rank may be selected e.g. top seven . Although this disclosure describes selecting grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries corresponding to the selected grammars e.g. those grammars having a score greater than a grammar threshold score . Each structured query may be based on a string generated by the corresponding selected grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends stanford the grammar user user filter school may generate a string friends who go to Stanford University where the non terminal tokens user user filter school of the grammar have been replaced by the terminal tokens friends who go to and Stanford University respectively to generate the string. In particular embodiments a string that is generated by grammar using a natural language syntax may be rendered as a structured query in natural language. As an example and not by way of limitation the structured query from the previous example uses the terminal token who go to which uses a natural language syntax so that the string rendered by grammar is in natural language. The natural language string generated by a grammar may then be rendered to form a structured query by modifying the query tokens corresponding to social graph element to include references to those social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation the string friends who go to Stanford University may be rendered so that the query token for Stanford University appears in the structured query as a reference to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford University where the reference may be include highlighting an inline link a snippet another suitable reference or any combination thereof. Each structured query may comprise query tokens corresponding to the corresponding selected grammar where these query tokens correspond to one or more of the identified edges and one or more of the identified nodes. Generating structured queries is described more below.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more query modifications for a structured query using a context free grammar model. Query modifications are discussed more below. A query modification may reference one or more additional nodes or one or more additional edges. This type of query modification may be used to refine or narrow the structured query. Alternatively a query modification may reference one or more alternate nodes or one or more alternate edges. This type of query modification may be used to pivot or broaden the structured query. Collectively these may be referred to as modifying nodes and modifying edges where the modification is to either add or replace a particular query token corresponding to a social graph element. The references in the query modification to additional or alternate nodes and edges may be used to add or replace query tokens in a structured query respectively. To identify possible query modifications for a structured query the social networking system may identify one or more grammars having query tokens corresponding to the selected nodes and selected edges from the original structured query. In other words the social networking system may identify the grammar actually used to generate that particular structured query other grammars that could have produced that structured query and grammars that could have that structured query as portion of another structured query. The social networking system may then identify query tokens in those grammars that may be added or replaced in the structured query. These additional or alternate query tokens may then be used to generate suggested query modifications which may be transmitted to the querying user as part of a search results page. The querying user may then select one or more of these query modifications and in response the social networking system may generate a new structured query and corresponding search results . This new structured query may include the modifying query tokens i.e. additional or alternate query tokens as appropriate. Although this disclosure describes generating query modifications in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating query modifications in any suitable manner.

More information on using grammar models with search queries may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 674 695 filed 12 Nov. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries that each comprise the query tokens of the corresponding grammar where the query tokens may correspond to one or more of the identified user nodes or one or more of the identified edges . The generated structured queries may be based on natural language strings generated by one or more context free grammars as described previously. This type of structured search query may allow the social networking system to more efficiently search for resources and content related to the online social network such as for example profile pages by searching for content connected to or otherwise related to the identified user nodes and the identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query show me friends of my girlfriend the social networking system may generate a structured query Friends of Stephanie where Friends and Stephanie in the structured query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements. The reference to Stephanie would correspond to a particular user node while the reference to friends would correspond to friend edges connecting that user node to other user nodes i.e. edges connecting to Stephanie s first degree friends . When executing this structured query the social networking system may identify one or more user nodes connected by friend edges to the user node corresponding to Stephanie. In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate a plurality of structured queries where the structured queries may comprise references to different identified user nodes or different identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query photos of cat the social networking system may generate a first structured query Photos of Catey and a second structured query Photos of Catherine where Photos in the structured query is a reference corresponding to a particular social graph element and where Catey and Catherine are references to two different user nodes . Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries that each comprise query tokens corresponding to the identified concept nodes and one or more of the identified edges . This type of structured search query may allow the social networking system to more efficiently search for resources and content related to the online social network such as for example profile pages by search for content connected to or otherwise related to the identified concept nodes and the identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends like facebook the social networking system may generate a structured query My friends who like Facebook where friends like and Facebook in the structured query are query tokens corresponding to particular social graph elements as described previously i.e. a friend edge a like edge and a Facebook concept node . In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate a plurality of structured queries where the structured queries may comprise references to different identified concept nodes or different identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the previous example in addition to the structured query My friends who like Facebook the social networking system may also generate a structured query My friends who like Facebook Culinary Team where Facebook Culinary Team in the structured query is a query token corresponding to yet another social graph element. In particular embodiments social networking system may rank the generated structured queries. The structured queries may be ranked based on a variety of factors. In particular embodiments the social networking system may ranks structured queries based on advertising sponsorship. An advertiser such as for example the user or administrator of a particular profile page corresponding to a particular node may sponsor a particular node such that a structured query referencing that node may be ranked more highly. Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may transmit one or more of the structured queries to the first user i.e. the querying user . As an example and not by way of limitation after the structured queries are generated the social networking system may transmit one or more of the structured queries as a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the referenced social graph elements other query limitations e.g. Boolean operators etc. as well as potentially other metadata associated with the referenced social graph elements. The web browser on the querying user s client system may display the transmitted structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in . In particular embodiments the transmitted queries may be presented to the querying user in a ranked order such as for example based on a rank previously determined as described above. Structured queries with better rankings may be presented in a more prominent position. Furthermore in particular embodiments only structured queries above a threshold rank may be transmitted or displayed to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the structured queries may be presented to the querying user in a drop down menu where higher ranked structured queries may be presented at the top of the menu with lower ranked structured queries presented in descending order down the menu. In the examples illustrated in only the seven highest ranked queries are transmitted and displayed to the user. In particular embodiments one or more references in a structured query may be highlighted e.g. outlined underlined circled bolded italicized colored lighted offset in caps in order to indicate its correspondence to a particular social graph element. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the references to Stanford University and Stanford California are highlighted outlined in the structured queries to indicate that it corresponds to a particular concept node . Similarly the references to Friends like work at and go to in the structured queries presented in drop down menu could also be highlighted to indicate that they correspond to particular edges . Although this disclosure describes transmitting particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates transmitting any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from the first user i.e. the querying user a selection of one of the structured queries. Alternatively the social networking system may receive a structured query as a query selected automatically by the system e.g. a default selection in certain contexts. The nodes and edges referenced in the received structured query may be referred to as the selected nodes and selected edges respectively. As an example and not by way of limitation the web browser on the querying user s client system may display the transmitted structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in which the user may then click on or otherwise select e.g. by simply keying enter on his keyboard to indicate the particular structured query the user wants the social networking system to execute. Upon selecting the particular structured query the user s client system may call or otherwise instruct to the social networking system to execute the selected structured query. Although this disclosure describes receiving selections of particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving selections of any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

More information on structured search queries may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more search results corresponding to a structured query. The search results may identify resources or content e.g. user profile pages content profile pages or external resources that match or are likely to be related to the search query. In particular embodiments each search result may correspond to a particular user node or concept node of the social graph . The search result may include a link to the profile page associated with the node as well as contextual information about the node i.e. contextual information about the user or concept that corresponds to the node . As an example and not by way of limitation referencing the structured query My friends who work at Facebook in query field generated the various search results illustrated in results field . Each search result in results field shows a link to a profile page of a user illustrated as the user s name which contains an inline link to the profile page and contextual information about that user that corresponds to a user node of the social graph . As another example and not by way of limitation referencing the structured query Photos of my friends from Tennessee in query field generated the various search results illustrated in results field . Each search result illustrated in shows a thumbnail of a photograph that corresponds to a concept node of the social graph. In particular embodiments each search result may correspond to a node that is connected to one or more of the selected nodes by one or more of the selected edges of the structured query. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing if user C submits a structured query Friends who like the Old Pro which references the friend type edge and the concept node of the location Old Pro the social networking system may return a search result corresponding to user B because the user node of user B is connected to the user node of user C by a friend type edge and also connected to the concept node of the location Old Pro by a like type edge . In particular embodiments the social networking system may also transmit advertisements or other sponsored content to the client system in response to the structured query. The advertisements may be included in as part of the search results or separately. The advertisements may correspond to one or more of the objects referenced in the search results. In particular embodiments the social networking system may filter out one or more search results identifying particular resources or content based on the privacy settings associated with the users associated with those resources or content. Although this disclosure describes generating particular search results in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable search results in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments a search result may include one or more snippets. A snippet is contextual information about the target of the search result. In other words a snippet provides information about that page or content corresponding to the search result. As an example and not by way of limitation a snippet may be a sample of content from the profile page or node corresponding to the search result. A snippet may be included along with search results for any suitable type of content. In particular embodiments the snippets displayed with a search result may be based on the type of content corresponding to the search result. As an example and not by way of limitation if the querying user is searching for users then the snippets included with the search results may be contextual information about the users displayed in the search results like the user s age location education or employer. As another example and not by way of limitation if the querying user is searching for photos then the snippets included with the search results may be contextual information about the photos displayed in the search results like the names of people or objects in the photo the number of likes views of the photo or the location where the photo was taken. As yet another example and not by way of limitation if the querying user is search for a location then the snippets included with the search results may be contextual information about the locations displayed in the search results like the address of the location operating hours of the location or the number of likes check ins at the location. The information provided in a snippet may be selected by the owner administrator of the target page or may be selected automatically be the social networking system . Snippets may be used to display key information about a search result such as image thumbnails summaries document types page views comments dates authorship ratings prices or other relevant information. In particular embodiments a snippet for a search result corresponding to users concepts in an online social network may include contextual information that is provided by users of the online social network or otherwise available on the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation a snippet may include one or more of the following types of information privacy settings of a group number of members in a group sponsored messages e.g. an inline ad unit rendered as a snippet page categories physical address biographical details interests relationship status sexual orientation preference sex gender age birthday current city education history political affiliations religious beliefs work history applications used comments tags other suitable contextual information or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments a snippet may include references to nodes or edges from the social graph . These snippets may be highlighted to indicate the reference corresponds to a social graph element. As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates a search result for the user Sol where one of the snippets for that search result is Likes Reposado The Slanted Door and 12 others. The terms Reposado and The Slanted Door are both highlighted underlined in this example to indicate that they are references to concept nodes corresponding to the concepts Reposado and The Slanted Door which are restaurants liked by the user Sol i.e. the user node for Sol is connected to the concept nodes for Reposado and The Slanted Door by a like type edge . The highlighted references in this example also contain inline links to the concept profile pages corresponding to Reposado and The Slanted Door . In particular embodiments the social networking system may filter out one or more snippets for a search result based on the privacy settings associated with the user identified by the search result. Although this disclosure describes particular types of snippets this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of snippets.

In particular embodiments a search result may include at least one snippet comprising one or more references to the selected nodes and the selected edges of a structured search query. In other words in response to a structured search query the social networking system may generate a search result with a snippet providing contextual information related to how the search result matches the search query. These may be referred to as lineage snippets since they provide social graph information node edge relationship information contextualizing how the particular search result is related to the social graph elements of the structured query. In other words a lineage snippet is a way of providing proof to the querying user that a particular search result satisfies a structured query. As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates a search results page for the structured query My friends who work at Facebook and work at Acme as software engineers. The social graph elements referenced in the structured query include my friends i.e. user nodes connected to the querying user s node by a friend type edge who work at Facebook i.e. user nodes connected to the concept node for Facebook by a work at type edge and work at Acme i.e. user nodes connected to the concept node for Acme by a work at type edge . The first search result illustrated in for Luke includes a snippet stating Director of Engineering at Facebook which corresponds to the who work at Facebook token from the structured query. Thus this snippet shows that the search result for Luke satisfies the who work at Facebook requirement of the structured query because Luke is Director of Engineering at Facebook. Other snippets in the Luke search result provide further context showing how that search result satisfies the other criteria of the structured query. In other words the user node for Luke is connected to the concept node for Facebook by a work at type edge . In particular embodiments a lineage snippet may include one or more of the following types of social graph information school attended worked in at pages liked apps used subscribing to subscribed by family relationships relationship connections married to dating etc. lives in near places checked into places visited by number of friends that live at a location number of friends that study at a location friends that are members of a group number of likes number of people talking about a page number of subscribers friends using an application number of users of an application people tagged in media people commented on in media people who created media other suitable social graph information or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments one or more of the references to the selected nodes or the selected edges in the lineage snippet may be highlighted to indicate that the reference corresponds to a selected node or a selected edge. Although this disclosure describes particular types of lineage snippets this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of lineage snippets.

In particular embodiments a search result may include a snippet comprising a reference to one or more nodes that are connected to the user node of the querying user by one or more edges . In other words the search result may include a snippet with contextual information about how the search result is related to the querying user s friends or related to concept nodes connected to the user. These may be referred to as social snippets since they provide social graph information node edge relationship information contextualizing how the particular search result is connected to the querying user and or the user s friends interests. As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates a search results page for the structured query My friends who work at Facebook and work at Acme as software engineers. The first search result illustrated in for Luke includes a snippet stating Your friend since April 2009 . This snippet provides contextual information about how the Luke search result is related to the querying user. In other words the user node for Luke is connected to the querying user s node by a friend type edge . The Luke search result also includes a snippet stating 197 mutual friends included Sol and Steven. This snippet provides contextual information about how the Luke search result is related to other nodes connected to the querying user. In other words both the user node of the querying user and the user node for Luke are connected to the same 197 user nodes by friend type edges . In particular embodiments the search result may include multilevel lineage snippet. A multilevel lineage snippet provides contextual information about how users or concepts references in the snippet may be related to the query tokens from the structured query. This may be used in response to complex structured queries. As an example and not by way of limitation user A and user D may be connected in the social graph by a brother type edge indicating that they are brothers . In response to a structured query for Show people who are brothers of Acme employees the social networking system may generate a search result for user A with a snippet stating Brother of User D. User D is a software engineer at Acme . This snippet provides contextual information about how the user A search result is related to user D they are brothers connected by a brother type edge and how user D is related to Acme user D is connected to Acme by a worked at type edge . Although this disclosure describes particular types of social snippets this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of social snippets.

In particular embodiments a search result may include a snippet that includes a customized structured query. This may be presented for example as an inline link within the snippet. The querying user may then be able to click or otherwise select once of a customized structured queries to transmit the query to the social networking system . In particular embodiments the customized structured query may be customized based on the associated search result such that the customized structured query includes a reference to the node corresponding to the search result and possible references to other social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing the search result for Paul includes a snippet reading Browse his Photos Friends Interests where Photo Friends and Interests are each customized structured queries to search for Photos of Paul i.e. concept nodes of photos that are connected to the user node of Paul by a tagged in type edge Friends of Paul and Interests of Paul i.e. concept nodes that are connected to the user node of Paul by an interested in type edge respectively. In particular embodiments the customized structured query may be customized based on the associated search result and the selected nodes edges from the original structured query i.e. the structured query that was used to produce the search result . These customized structured queries would then include a reference to the node corresponding to the search result and references to the selected nodes and the selected edges from the original structured query. These may be referred to as lineage pivot snippets since they are based on the social graph elements from the original structured query like a lineage snippet as well as the node corresponding to the search result thus pivoting the query based on the search result. As an example and not by way of limitation again referencing the structured query People who currently work for Facebook and like Unicycling generated the search results illustrated in results field . The search result for Tom could include a snippet with a structured query Friends of Tom who like Unicycling thus referencing both the user node of the search result i.e. the user node of Tom and a selected node and selected edge from the original structured query i.e. the concept node for Unicycling connected by a like type edge . As another example and not by way of limitation referencing the structured query People who like mexican restaurants in Palo Alto Calif. generated the search results illustrated in results field . The search result for Sol includes a snippet Like Reposado The Slanted Door and 12 others where Reposado and The Slanted Door are both reference to concept nodes for particular Mexican restaurants in Palo Alto. Similarly the reference to 12 others could be an inline link for a structured query Mexican restaurants liked by Sol in Palo Alto Calif. thus referencing both the user node of the search result i.e. the user node of Sol and a selected node and selected edge from the original structured query i.e. the concept node for Palo Alto Calif. and the like type edge . Although this disclosure describes generating particular snippets with customized structured queries this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable snippets with customized structured queries.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may score one or more snippets corresponding to a search result or snippets corresponding to a node or profile page that is the target of the search result . In response to a structured query the social networking system may identify nodes corresponding to the query and then access one or more snippets corresponding to each of these identified nodes. The social networking system may then determine for each search result a score for each of the snippets corresponding to the search result. When generating a search result only those snippets having a score greater than a snippet threshold score may be included in the search result. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a ranking for each snippet where only the top five ranked snippets are included in a particular search result. Alternatively the social networking system may score each snippet and include all available snippets with the search result presented in ranked order by score possibly bypassing a ranking threshold to display a greater number of snippets with a search result . Furthermore different search results may include different numbers of snippets. For example a first search result may only have two snippets associated with it and both snippets might be displayed in ranked order by score while a second search result may have nine snippets associated with it and all nine snipped may be displayed in ranked order by score. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a snippet based on the social relevance of the snippet to the structured query. Snippets that reference social graph elements that are more closely connected or otherwise relevant to the querying user may be scored more highly than snippets that reference social graph elements that are not as closely connected or are otherwise less relevant to the querying user. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a snippet based on the textual relevance of the snippet to the structured query. The textual relevance of a particular snippet may be based on how the terms and number of terms in the particular snippet match to the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a snippet based on a search history associated with the querying user. Snippets referencing social graph elements that the querying user has previously accessed or are relevant to nodes profile pages the querying user has previously accessed may be more likely to be relevant to the user s structured query. Thus these snippets may be given a higher relative score. As an example and not by way of limitation if the querying user has previously search for My female friends who are single then the social networking system may determine that the querying user is interested in the relationship status of people he is searching for because of the query modifier who are single in the query which will search for users having a relationship status of single . Thus in response to subsequent queries e.g. Facebook engineers who went to Stanford University as illustrated in the social networking system may score snippets showing the relationship status of the search result more highly than other snippets because of the querying user s history of interest in that type of contextual information thus the search results illustrated in may have scored the snippets showing the relationship statues for each search result more highly such as for example in a relationship or married . In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a snippet based on a category of the search. Searches may be categorized based on the type of content that is the subject of the search. Snippets that are more relevant to the type of content being searched for may be scored more highly than less relevant snippets. As an example and not by way of limitation when searching for user snippets that include personal information about the user e.g. location relationship status etc. may be scored more highly than other types of snippets since personal information may be considered more relevant to a querying user searching for other users. As another example and not by way of limitation when searching for concepts snippets that include social graph information about the concept e.g. number of subscribers fan number of likes number of check ins reviews etc. may be scored more highly than other types of snippets since social graph information may be more relevant to a querying user searching for concepts. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a snippet based on advertising sponsorship. An advertiser such as for example the user or administrator of a particular profile page corresponding to a particular node may sponsor a particular node such that a snippet referencing that node may be scored more highly. Although this disclosure describes scoring snippets in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring snippets in any suitable manner.

As discussed previously illustrate example search results pages. The structured query used to generate a particular search results page is shown in query field and the various search results generated in response to the structured query are illustrated in results field . In response to a structured query received from a querying user the social networking system may generate one or more query modifications that may be used to refine or pivot the query. The query modifications may reference particular social graph elements allowing the querying user to add or replace the social graph elements referenced in a structured query. In particular embodiments one or more query modifications may be presented on a search results page in a modifications field a suggested searches field an expanded searches field or a disambiguation field . Query modifications may be used to refine or narrow a structured query by adding additional terms to the query. In general adding additional terms to a structured query will reduce the number of search results generated by the query. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the structured query My friends who go to Stanford University the social networking system may generate query modifications to the My friends term such as for example My male female friends to filter the search results by sex or My single married friends to filter the search results by relationship status. Query modifications may also be used to pivot or broaden a structured query by changing one or more terms of the query. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the structured query My friends who work at Facebook the social networking system may generate the query modification work at Acme which can replace the work at Facebook term thereby pivoting the query from searching one set of users to searching another set. By providing these suggested query modifications to the querying user the social networking system may provide a powerful way for users to search for exactly what they are looking for. Once a query modification is selected by the querying user a new structured query may be generated using an appropriate grammar such that the new structured query is also rendered using a natural language syntax. The social networking system may also generate alternative structured queries that may be displayed on the search results page. These alternative structured queries include suggested queries broadening queries and disambiguation queries which are described more below. Although this disclosure describes generating querying modifications in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates query modifications in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes presenting query modifications to users in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates presenting query modifications to users in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more query modifications. The query modifications may be generated in response to receiving a first structured query such that the query modification may be used to modify the first structured query. A query modification may be any type of term that can be used to modify a search query. For example a query modification may be a text string an n gram a terminal query token a value a property a query operator another suitable type of term or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments the query modifications may be organized by category. As an example and not by way of limitation the modifications field illustrated in shows query modifications for Employer School Current City Hometown Relationship Status Interested in Friendship Gender Name and Likes . In particular embodiments the query modifications may be transmitted to the querying user as part of the search results page. As an example and not by way of limitation the search results pages illustrated in and F all illustrate lists of query modifications displayed in drop down menus in the modifications field . The query modifications listed in these drop down menus may be used to add or replace terms in the structured query displayed in search field . In particular embodiments a customized query modification may be generated in conjunction with a typeahead process. Rather than selecting from a list of pre generated query modifications a user may input a text string and the typeahead process may identify social graph elements that correspond to one or more of the n grams from the inputted text string. The social networking system may then present one or more possible matches. As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates the querying user inputting the string Harvard into an input field for the School category in the modifications field . In response the typeahead process has generated several possible matching query modifications including Harvard Harvard Law School and Harvard Westlake among others. These listed schools displayed in the drop down menu are references to concept nodes in the social graph that correspond to these schools. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular categories of query modifications this disclosure contemplates any suitable categories of query modifications.

In particular embodiments a query modification may include references to one or more modifying nodes or one or more modifying edges from the social graph . A modifying node or a modifying edge may be used to add or replace a reference to a node or edge in the first structured query. The querying user may then selected one or more of these query modifications to add the modifying nodes edges to the first structured query or by replacing nodes edges in the structured query with one or more of the modifying nodes edges. As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates an example search results page generated by the structured query My friends who work at Facebook and work at Acme as software engineers . The querying user may want to refine the search by also specifying a school attended by the users identified by the search query. To specify a school the querying user may click on the School drop down menu as illustrated in which may display a list of query modifications generated by the social networking system . In this case the drop down menu in lists the schools Stanford University Menlo Atherton High and UC Berkeley among others. These listed schools displayed in the drop down menu are references to concept nodes in the social graph that correspond to these schools. The querying user may then select one or more of these query modifications to add the referenced school to the structured query thereby filtering the search results by school. In response to the selection from the querying user the social networking system may modify the structured query to include a reference to the selected school. As another example and not by way of limitation illustrates an example search results page generated by the structured query My friends who work at Facebook . The reference to my friends corresponds to user nodes connected to the querying user by a friend type edge while the reference to Facebook corresponds to the concept node for the company Facebook. These references to particular nodes and edges in the structured query are shown in the modifications field illustrated in where the category for Employer already has the term Facebook selected while the category for Friendship already has the term My friends selected. However the querying user may want to pivot the search to instead search for friends at another company. To modify the query the querying user may select the Employer category to change the reference from Facebook to another company such as for example Acme. When the querying user selects the Employer category the social networking system may display a list of query modifications that have been generated for that category. In response to a selection from the querying user the social networking system may then modify the structured query and replace the reference to Facebook with a reference to Acme such that the new structured query would be My friends who work at Acme thereby pivoting the search from one set of friends to another. Although this disclosure describes using particular query modifications in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates using any suitable query modifications in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate a second structured query in response to a selection of one or more of the query modifications. The querying user may select one or more of the query modifications from the menus illustrated in modifications field for example by clicking or otherwise selecting a particular query modification. In particular embodiments the query modification may reference additional nodes or additional edges for the first structured query. In this case the social networking system may generate a second structured query comprising references to the selected nodes and the selected edges from the first structured query and each modifying node or modifying edge referenced in the selected query modification. As an example and not by way of limitation for the first structured query My friends in San Jose the social networking system may receive the query modification work at Acme which references connections to the concept node for Acme by a worked at type edge . The social networking system may then generate a second structured query My friends in San Jose who work at Acme which incorporates the addition node and additional edge referenced in the query modification. In particular embodiments the query modification may reference alternative nodes or alternative edges for the first structured query. In this case the social networking system may generate a second structured query comprising references to the selected nodes and the selected edges from the first structured query except each reference to an alternative node replaces a reference to a selected node of the first structured query. Similarly each reference to an alternative edge replaces a reference to a selected edge of the first structured query. As an example and not by way of limitation for the first structured query My friends in San Jose the social networking system may receive the query modification in San Francisco which references connections to the concept node for the city San Francisco by live in type edges . The social networking system may then generate a second structured query My friends in San Francisco which replaces the reference to the selected node edge in San Jose from the first structured query with the alternative node edge in San Francisco . Although this disclosure describes generating particular modified structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable modified structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may score one or more query modifications for a first structured query. In response to a structured query the social networking system may identify one or more query modifications that may be used to modify structured query. The social networking system may then determine a score for each of the identified query modifications. When generating a set of query modifications to transmit to a querying user only those query modifications having a score greater than a query modification threshold score may be included in the set of query modifications that are actually transmitted. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a ranking for each query modification where only the top six ranked query modifications are included in a particular search result. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a query modification based on the social relevance of the query modification to the structured query. Query modifications that reference social graph elements that are more closely connected or otherwise relevant to the querying user may be scored more highly than query modifications that reference social graph elements that are not as closely connected or are otherwise less relevant to the querying user. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a query modification based on the number of possible search results corresponding to the query modification. Query modifications that would generate more results i.e. filter out fewer results may be scored more highly than query modifications that generate fewer results. In other words a query modification that when used to modify to the first structured query will match more results or more of the current results may be scored more highly than a query modification that will match fewer results. As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates possible query modifications for the School category in modification field . The query modification referencing Stanford University may be ranked highly in this list of suggested query modifications because many search results match this limitation. In other words of the user nodes corresponding to the search results in results field many of those user nodes may be connected to the concept node for Stanford University by an edge . Thus if a reference to the concept node for Stanford University was added to the structured query illustrated in query field many of the current search results would still match the structured query i.e. few would be filtered out . Similarly lower ranked schools in the drop down menu such as Carnegie Mellon University and Santa Clara University may match fewer of the current results i.e. would filter out more results and as such are ranked lower. Pivoting query modifications may be scored similarly. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a query modification based on a search history associated with the querying user. Query modifications referencing social graph elements that the querying user has previously accessed or are relevant to nodes profile pages the querying user has previously accessed may be more likely to be relevant to the user s structured query. Thus these query modifications may be given a higher relative score. As an example and not by way of limitation if the querying user has previously search for My friends at Stanford University then the social networking system may determine that the querying user is interested in user nodes connected to the concept node for Stanford University. Thus in response to subsequent queries the social networking system may rank query modifications referencing Stanford University more highly than other query modifications because of the querying user s history of interest in that type of contextual information thus the search results illustrated in may have ranked the query modifications for Stanford University more highly . In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a score for a query modification based on advertising sponsorship. An advertiser such as for example the user or administrator of a particular profile page corresponding to a particular node may sponsor a particular node such that a query modification referencing that node may be scored more highly. Although this disclosure describes scoring query modifications in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring query modifications in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments in response to a first structured query the social networking system may generate one or more second structured queries to pivot the structured query. Each of these second structured queries may be based on the first structured query. These may be referred to as suggested queries. These suggested queries may be variations of the first structured query where the suggested query uses at least some of the same query tokens as the first structured query. However in order to pivot the query one or more of the query tokens from the first structured query may be replaced with alternative query tokens. In other words the social networking system may replace one or more references to selected nodes edges from the first structured query with one or more references to alternative nodes edges in order to generate one or more second structured queries. The alternative query tokens may be determined by identifying query tokens that if substituted into the first structured query would produce similar search results. As an example and not by way of limitation for the first structured query My friends who go to Stanford University the social networking system may identify one or more query tokens that may be substituted into the first structured query. For example the query token for Stanford University may be replaced by other schools. As another example the query tokens for who go to and Stanford University may both be replaced by query tokens for who live in and Palo Alto . This latter example may produce many of the same search results as the first structured query because of the high overlap between users who live in the city Palo Alto and users who attend the school Stanford University since the school is geographical proximate to the city i.e. in the social graph there may be a large overlap between user nodes that are connected to the concept node for Stanford and the concept node for Palo Alto . The alternative query tokens may also be determined by using templates based on the original query. As an example and not by way of limitation if the first structured query is search for users the suggested queries may also be searches for user. Similarly if the first structured query is a search for photos the suggested queries may also be searches for photos. In particular embodiments the suggested queries may be transmitted to the querying user as part of the search results page. As an example and not by way of limitation the search results page illustrated in shows some example suggested queries in the suggested searches field . In response to the first structured query My friends who work at Facebook the social networking system generated the suggested structured queries My friends of friends who like Facebook and My friends who live in Palo Alto Calif. among others which are shown in suggested searches field . These suggested queries may have been generated based on the first structured query where one or more of the query tokens from the first structured query have been replaced. Although this disclosure describes generating structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments in response to a first structured query the social networking system may generate one or more second structured queries to broaden the structured query. These may be referred to as broadening queries. These broadening queries may be variations of the first structured query where the broadening query uses less query tokens than the first structured query or replaces particular query tokens in order to generate more search results. In other words the social networking system may delete one or more references to selected nodes edges from the first structured query in order to generate one or more second structured queries. Similarly the social networking system may replace one or more references to selected nodes edges from the first structured query with one or more references to alternative nodes edges in order to generate one or more second structured queries. In this case the alternative query tokens may be determined by identifying query tokens that if substituted into the first structured query would produce more search results than the original query token. In particular embodiments broadening structured queries may be generated when the search results corresponding to the first structured query are below a threshold number of search results. Structured queries with too many limitations or that use query tokens that do not match many social graph entities may produce few or no results. When a structured query produces too few results it may be useful to provide suggests for how to modify that query to generate additional result. The social networking system may analyze the first structured query and provide suggestion for how to modify the query so that it produces more results. The threshold number of search results may be any suitable number of results and may be determined by the social networking system or be user defined. In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more second structured queries comprising references to zero or more selected nodes and zero or more selected edges from the first structured query where each second structured query comprises at least one fewer reference to the selected nodes or the selected edges than the first structured query. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing in response to the first structured query People who currently work for Facebook and like Unicycling the social networking system generated the broadening queries People who like Unicycling and Current Facebook employees in expanded searched field . These broadening queries may have been generated based on the first structured query where one more or of the query tokens from the first structured query have been removed i.e. the references to Facebook and Unicycling have been removed respectively . By removing limitations from the first structured query more users should satisfy the query and thus these queries should generate more search results. In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more second structured queries comprising references to zero or more selected nodes and zero or more selected edges from the first structured query where each second structured query comprises replaces at least one reference to a selected node or a selected edge of the first structured query with an alternative node or an alternative edge respectively. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing again the social networking system generated the broadening queries People interested in Unicycling Facebook used to employ and People interested in Unicycling Facebook ever employed . These broadening query may have been generated based on the first structured query where the currently work for query token has been replaced by used to employ and ever employed query tokens respectively thereby filtering search results using a different timeframe which may expand the types of connecting edges that may satisfy this query from work at type edges to also include worked at type edges . In particular embodiments the broadening queries may be transmitted to the querying user as part of the search results page. As an example and not by way of limitation the search results page illustrated in shows some example broadening queries in the expanded searches field which have been discussed above. Although this disclosure describes generating particular broadening queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable broadening queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments in response to a first structured query the social networking system may generate one or more second structured queries to disambiguate the structured query. These may be referred to as disambiguation queries. These disambiguation queries may be variations of the first structured query where the disambiguation query uses some of the query tokens from the first structured query but may also replace some of the query tokens with alternative query tokens. This may happen where certain nodes may correspond to the same n gram from an unstructured text query from the querying user e.g. the n gram for stanford could correspond to the concept node for either the school Stanford University or the city Stanford California . Disambiguation may also be helpful when the referenced edge types or the relationships between referenced nodes are unclear in the structured query. The social networking system may determine that particular structured queries are ambiguous in that the natural language syntax of the structured query may be interpreted in different ways by the querying user. Consequently when selecting a particular structured query the social networking system may generate search results that are unexpected or not what the querying user was looking for. In these cases the social networking system may provide an explanation of how the structured query was parsed and how it identified the displayed search results. Additionally the social networking system may provide variations of the original query to help the querying user find what he or she is looking for. In particular embodiments the disambiguation queries may be transmitted to the querying user as part of the search results page. As an example and not by way of limitation the search results page illustrated in illustrates an example disambiguation query displayed in disambiguation field . In response to the first structured query Photos of my friends from Tennessee the social networking system generated the disambiguation query Photos in Tennessee by my friends . The social networking system also provided an explanation of how it parsed the first structured query stating that These results show photos that belong to friends of yours from Tennessee . In other words the social networking system parsed the first structured query to identify concept nodes corresponding to photos that were connected to user nodes by a tagged in type edge and where these user nodes were connected to a concept node for Tennessee by a lived in or from type edge . In contrast the suggested disambiguation query would identify concept nodes corresponding to photos that were connected to the concept node for Tennessee by a taken in type edge where the concept nodes for the photos were also connected to user nodes of the querying user s friends. Although this disclosure describes generating particular disambiguation queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable disambiguation queries in any suitable manner.
