title: Data detection and protection policies for e-mail
abstract: Systems and/or methods for deploying and implementing data loss prevention (DLP) policy definition that may encapsulate the requirements, control objectives and directives, and/or the definitions of sensitive data types as stipulated directly or indirectly by the regulatory policy are disclosed. In one embodiment, DLP policies may be identified by an organization to run on top of a set of electronic file systems (e.g., email systems, file systems, web servers and the like). Organizations and their administrators may implement a set of DLP policy instance which are derived from DLP policy templates. DLP policy templates may comprise both structure and meaningâ€”and may acquire a given DLP policy by the replacement of parameterized expressions with desired parameter values. In another embodiment, the state of the DLP policy instance may change according to the lifecycle of the policy instance deployment.
