The present inventive concepts relate to the field of fiber optics and more particularly to systems and methods for processing optical fibers.

The advancement of the state of the art of fiber laser technology has been quite rapid over the past decade. The increasing availability of efficient powerful pump laser diodes and the development of pump combiner devices and attendant optical matching components has pushed attainable output power and radiance to previously unseen levels. However the tools for constructing such devices have not kept pace. Assembly of high power fiber lasers and their components has remained a skilled craft requiring lengthy manual processes and delivering low production yields.

Due to the high optical power levels involved and especially with the development of cladding pumped designs the requirements for alignment cleave quality cleanliness and correct splice taper and diffusion geometry are more stringent than even the most critical of previous lower power applications. Cleave angle specifications for 125 m telecom splices typically allow 1 or more of deviation from the perpendicular compared to a high power splice which might require 

In the 1990 s several manufacturers introduced fiber preparation and fusion splicing machines that enabled the high volume production of EDFA s for the telecom boom. These machines employed varying degrees of fixturing and automation to drastically reduce the time and skill required to make low loss high strength splices. However by design these tools were limited to relatively small fibers typically 250 m maximum cladding diameter. Before these developments hand alignment under optical microscopes and flame heat sources were the means used to splice fibers just as they often are for the large diameter fibers of today s laser applications.

As fiber lasers begin to move from research and development R D to volume production there is a need to simplify improve and automate the steps required for their assembly as was done for telecom applications. New cleaving and heat source technologies implemented in a well designed workstation comprise a substantial step forward in making high power laser manufacturing a high yield repeatable process. Flexible capabilities including multi axis positioning wide field optics and multi application control software enable splicing bundling tapering cleaving and end cap attachment to be performed on the same machine. However even with such advancements there remain limitations due to heat sources typically used in optical fiber processing which increased automation have not resolved.

These terms are used to distinguish one element from another but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example a first element can be termed a second element and similarly a second element can be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being on or connected or coupled to another element it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion e.g. between versus directly between adjacent versus directly adjacent etc. .

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

In accordance with aspects of the present invention provided is a multi stage fiber processing system configured for providing an extended heat zone along an axis of at least one optical fiber. The extended heat zone may have various utilities such as for example tapering the fiber where one or both ends of the fiber can be pulled to create a desired taper originating in the extended heat zone. Such multi stage fiber processing systems can also be useful in other contexts and applications such as annealing diffusion splicing and ablation.

The extended heat zone delivers a substantially isothermic or uniform distribution of heat about the fiber. In a presently preferred embodiment the extended heat zone is formed using two 3 electrode heat sources where the gap distances between the electrodes is the same. When properly configured a total of 9 arcs are created among the six electrodes. Three arcs are generated between the three electrodes of each heat source which account for six total arcs. And 3 arcs are generated between the two 3 electrode heat sources which can be controlled to rotate about the fiber in either of a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The 9 arcs create a vortex having a substantially isothermic profile.

Fiber may be secured at two points with first and second holding devices and . For a tapering configuration both of devices and may be or include a clamp coupled to a translation mechanism such as a stepper motor. However in some embodiments it is possible that only one of holding devices and includes a translation mechanism while the other device can be a stationary clamp. In yet other embodiments each of devices and can be stationary clamps although this would not be particularly useful for tapering.

A controller can be attached to one or both of holding devices and to controller their movement. A monitoring system e.g. a vision system can be used to monitor changes to fiber e.g. for tapering or diffusion purposes and provide feedback to controller . For example when tapering a vision system can be used to ensure the desired taper has been achieved. The heat sources HS and HS can also be coupled to a controller so control various aspects thereof. For example when HS and HS are multi electrode heat sources the control can control the input power to the electrodes which could be done on an individual electrode basis. The controller could be used to control the direction and intensities of arcs formed between the two or more 3 electrode heat sources or other adjustable parameters of other heat sources. Such devices and controller can be coupled to a workstation or other computer for setting parameters operator control program control and measurement analysis and monitoring.

In some embodiments the heat sources HS and HS can be disposed in at least a partial vacuum . As an example heat sources HS and HS can be disposed in a 22 to 24 Hg gauge vacuum 200 to 150 torr absolute. As another example heat sources HS and HS can be disposed in an oxygen enriched partial vacuum with plasma at a temperature of not more than about 400 C.

In the preferred embodiment the heat sources HS and HS include multi electrode heat sources. Such multi electrode heat sources can each include at least three electrodes. Three electrode heat sources have proven useful in a variety of fiber optic processing as developed by 3SAE Technologies Inc. Franklin Tennessee which are also the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 7 670 065 entitled Multi Electrode System which is referred to as the Ring of Fire and can achieve fiber temperatures from less than 100 C. to greater than 3000 C. The actual temperature will be chosen based on fiber and the intended operation e.g. tapering diffusion splicing annealing and so on.

In a multi electrode heat source includes three electrodes and arranged in a Y configuration where an arc is generated between each adjacent pair of electrodes. For example an arc is generated between electrodes and an arc is generated between electrodes and and an arc is generated between electrodes and . The three arcs and create a heated field surrounding the fiber . The heated field is preferably a substantially isothermic heated field. In some embodiments the heated field is a substantially uniform heated plasma field.

In a multi electrode heat source includes three electrodes and arranged in a T configuration where an arc is generated between each adjacent pair of electrodes. For example as with multi electrode heat source an arc is generated between electrodes and an arc is generated between electrodes and and an arc is generated between electrodes and . The three arcs and create a heated field surrounding the fiber . The heated field is preferably a substantially uniform heated field. In some embodiments the heated field is a substantially uniform heated plasma field.

The heat zone created by a 3 electrode arrangement can be relatively narrow e.g. 1 mm in width at max . Using multiple stages of 3 electrode heat sources effectively adds a 3dimension to the heat zone creating the extended heat zone or vortex. A wider heat zone has the advantage of reducing variation in the diameter of the tapered zone. The thermal profile of the extended heat zone can be controlled based on the spacing between heat sources and the power delivered to them. The axially narrow heat zone of a single stage of the three phase Ring of Fire which is shown in and B has advantages for many applications but a broader heat source benefits applications such as Thermally Expanded Core splicing post splice fire polishing and high ratio tapers. For such applications the three electrode system can be expanded to a six electrode configuration. In the six electrode system there are two heat source stages HS and HS each with three electrodes.

In the view provided by it can be seen that arcs are produced by the six electrodes and . Three arcs are generated between electrodes and and three arcs are generated between electrodes and . Additionally 3 arcs are created between the two heat sources HS and HS to generate heat zone as a substantially isothermic heated field around fiber . For the 3 arcs formed between the heat sources one arc is formed between one electrode in heat source HS and one electrode of heat source HS. As an example a different arc can be formed between electrode and electrode and and electrode and for a total of 3 arcs formed between heat sources HS and HS. The forming of these arcs can be accomplished to create an effect of the arcs or heated field rotating clockwise or counterclockwise around fiber . This is shown in .

In the preferred embodiments the multi electrode heat source includes a digitally controlled three phase high voltage source driving three tungsten electrodes . The points of the electrodes form an equilateral triangle and the resulting plasma discharge forms in a substantially triangular shape about their mutual center and perpendicular to the fiber axis. In the preferred embodiments the electrode spacing can be varied from 1 mm to 3 mm or more depending on the desired transverse width of the heat zone. Closer spacing provides more stability at lower input power. Wider spacing provides even heating of larger fibers. The system can be adjusted from very low power suitable for splicing of 

A multiphase drive circuit drives the six electrodes 3 per heat source stage to form a three dimensional glow discharge in the form of extend heat zone completely surrounding the fiber for a length of easily up to 0 mm to 10 mm as is shown by the Gaussian heat distribution of . The preferred heat zone width may be about 3 mm. There is no inherent limitation of the heat zone width and more than two stages of heat sources could be used to further expand the heat zone. The two triangular sets of three electrodes can be aligned and driven 120 displaced in phase or rotationally offset by 60 with their tips forming an irregular octahedron. The spacing between the two sets may be adjusted to control the axial extent of the heated plasma vortex. Electronic adjustments to the drive waveforms can significantly alter the heat distribution transferred to the fiber or device. This system can also be operated as one or two independent three phase planar systems.

With most conventional heat sources including the Ring of Fire the axial distribution of heat is essentially Gaussian and the width of the effective heat zone cannot be changed during operation. The six electrode system opens new possibilities as the heat distribution is controlled by the relative phase of different features of the drive waveforms and can be altered asymmetrically and in real time. This will provide more flexible heat application for dissimilar fiber splices and tapering. As described previously for a narrow symmetrical heat source the geometry of a taper is defined by the motion and acceleration of the two segments of fiber on either side of the molten zone. A heat source with an axial extent of several millimeters and an asymmetrical heat zone can produce tapers defined by temperature distribution rather than acceleration.

In the example there is an arc present between electrodes and at time 0 s see plots and . At approximately 6 s the arc shifts to the space between electrodes and see plots and . At 13 s the arc moves to electrodes and see plots and and so forth. At any given time an arc should be present between two electrodes with the greatest potential difference between them. The rotating phase sequence takes place so rapidly that the arc appears to be constantly on and substantially constant heating is provided as the thermal time constants of the fiber and surrounding air are substantially longer than the oscillation period of the arc.

It can be extremely difficult to actually control the voltage at the electrodes. However a far more practical method of controlling current to the primary of the step up transformer can be applied in the illustrative embodiment. shows graph having a preferred waveform for the current applied to the transformer primaries. This system of drive currents will produce output voltage waveforms roughly corresponding to those shown in producing a controllable three phase arc.

The primary drive currents for the transformers require three waveforms disposed at 0 degrees phase 120 degrees phase and 240 degrees phase. These can be generated by well known digital or analog means such as a ring counter. In graph plot is for electrode plot is for electrode and plot is for electrode .

The required voltages could be generated from three separate 10CT 780 high voltage transformers and or from a tuned LC configuration wound on a single core. It is also possible for the three transformer and secondaries to be connected in a delta configuration wherein the secondary coils are connected between adjacent pairs of electrodes rather than being referenced to ground as in .

In MOSFETS and drive transformers and . In accordance with various aspects of the invention the multi electrode system can include a dead band feature to increases efficiency and reduce dissipation in the drive transistors MOSFETs and by preventing overlap in conduction between the positive driving and negative driving devices. The dead band feature can also provide a mechanism for adjusting arc power e.g. by varying the width of the dead band . The dead band feature can also enable cleaner transitions between states of the arcs by allowing an existing arc to extinguish momentarily before establishing the next arc in the phase sequence.

The dead band feature can be implemented by producing the controlled current waveforms to include two dead bands of 1 to 49 of the period of the cycle wherein there is substantially no current flow through the transformer primary.

Another embodiment of a three electrode system can generate an arc of substantially the same properties as that of the three electrode system described above with respect to B A and B but with one grounded electrode and only two powered electrodes.

In one embodiment electrodes and are powered and electrode is grounded. At a particular degree of phase separation between 0 and 180 between the voltage waveforms applied to electrodes and with electrode grounded all three arcs would be formed at substantially equal intensity. A theoretical analysis based on vector mathematics suggests that this would occur at 60 relative phase. In implementation it has been found necessary to vary the phase between approximately 40 and 160 depending on various implementation factors such as the frequency and power of the drive waveforms and the spacing and condition of the electrodes.

In the embodiment of the signals which turn the drive MOSFETs and on and off can be generated by a programmable microcontroller unit and provided via buffers and . As examples the MOSFET drivers and can be MC34151 or similar MOSFETs and the microcontroller can be a PAL18F2520 manufactured by Microchip Inc. This circuit of this embodiment allows real time control and adjustment of the duration and phase relationship of the drive signals. The real time adjustments can be made with the goal of maintaining arcs and substantially equal in intensity or to deliberately alter their relative intensity for various purposes.

In order for the microcontroller to be able to sense the arc intensities small value resistors R for example 100 Ohm resistors can be connected in series with the ground return of each drive signal. A voltage develops across the resistor R in direct proportion to the arc current delivered by the electrode . A sense resistor R is provided for each electrode. For example a 20 mA current from electrode would result in a 2V signal across the 100 Ohm sense resistor R.

The sense resistor signals are in the form of high frequency AC voltages. It is possible to rectify and filter these signals to produce DC voltages which are more suitable for measurement by the microcontroller unit .

The simple rectification filtering networks shown include a diode D two resistors R and R and a capacitor C and are provided for each of the three electrodes. This network produces a voltage proportional to the arithmetic mean i.e. average of the absolute value of the sense resistor voltage. If greater accuracy is required well known means can be used to produce a voltage proportional to the quadratic mean e.g. root mean square or RMS of the sense resistor voltage. The RMS value is a better measurement of the power delivered into the arc which may be important in some applications.

An additional improvement to the embodiment can be to make the power supply adjustable which is shown as 12V in . An adjustable buck regulator circuit well known in the art can adjust the voltage downward from 12V to a very low voltage e.g. 1V or any desired intermediate voltage. This can be useful when an arc of very low power is required as it has been found that very low pulse widths to the MOSFET s the previous method of obtaining low power operation can result in unstable arc operation. Alternatively a lower input voltage and or lower transformer step up ratio can be used in conjunction with a boost type regulator to provide an equivalent range of voltages.

In some embodiments each of the 6 electrodes in can be driven by its own transformer. For instance each heat source HS and HS could use the circuitry of or .

In yet other embodiments two electrodes one from each 3 electrode heat source can share a transformer and the other four electrodes can each have its own transformer. For example referring to each heat source HS and HS could share the third transformer for electrode in each 3 electrode heat source. And electrodes and could have their own respective transformers.

Tapering can be accomplished in step by selectively translating the first and second fiber holder away from each other. The method can further comprise cleaving the at least one fiber step and splicing the at least one fiber with only one of the plurality of heat sources step .

It will be apparent that there are other possible arrangements of the electrodes that are within the spirit and scope of the invention. These alternative arrangements may be preferable in circumstances where it is desired to change the pattern of heating of the fiber or where an alternative arrangement facilitates the positioning of the electrodes with respect to other equipment in a larger system.

In various embodiments more than two stages of heat sources could be used and each heat source does not have to be of the same type. The heat source can take the form of any known or later developed heat source. For example the heat source can be a two electrode heat source. The heat source can include a flame. The flame can be applied directly to the fiber or applied to a crucible that surrounds the fiber. The heat source can be a filament heat source that substantially surrounds the fiber. The filament heat source can include a Tungsten or graphite filament. The laser can be a 10 m CO2 laser. Preferably the heat sources provide a substantially uniform heated field about the fiber unless there is a particular reason not to have a uniform field. Multi electrode heat sources are narrow and highly controllable so lend themselves to a relatively high degree of control.

The various techniques known for improving and controlling arc performance with conventional two electrode systems can also be applied or adapted to embodiments including pulse width modulation ion injection feedback control etc. The electrodes can also be fitted with shields or focusing sleeves or other technologies intended to alter arc distribution. Known arc bending techniques utilizing dielectrics inserted near the plasma field can also be used.

The principles of the present invention could also be extended to a system of four or more electrodes as example but three electrodes provide a deterministic arc sequence and substantially even heating. The system could also use 2 electrode heat sources but again three electrode heat sources are presently preferred.

It is intended by the following claims to claim that which is literally described and all equivalents thereto including all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of each claim.
