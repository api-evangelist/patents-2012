The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to a fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool. More specifically but without limitation the present invention is for use when performing maintenance on the F 35 fighter specifically when removing and replacing the fueldraulic actuator.

A fueldraulic actuator is an apparatus in a jet engine which uses pressurized fuel to move the main thrust vectoring nozzle. In the F 35 military jet fighter in order to replace the actuator an engine roll back must first be performed. This is due to the tight clearances inside the engine bay. An engine roll back requires parts of the engine and other related parts to be removed from the engine bay. This creates a long cycle time for replacing an actuator.

For the foregoing reasons there is a need for a fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool that allows quick and easy removal and replacement of the fuel actuator without performing an engine roll back.

The present invention is directed to a fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool that meets the needs enumerated above and below.

The present invention is directed to a fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool that includes a base an actuator chassis and at least one articulating arm. The actuator chassis is able to communicate with a jet fueldraulic actuator located in a jet engine bay such that the actuator can be removed from the jet engine bay. The actuator chassis is connectable to the actuator at three predetermined points on the actuator. The at least one articulating arm which is attached to the base communicates with the actuator chassis such that the actuator chassis can be moved forward frontwards and backwards left and right oriented at different inclines and adjusted to allow the actuator chassis to align and interface with the jet fueldraulic actuator.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide a fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool that allows replacement of the actuator without performing an engine rollback.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool that reduces cycle time as well as man power required to maintain and replace the fueldraulic actuator.

The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . As shown in the fueldraulic actuator installation and removal tool includes a base an actuator chassis an inclined plane section a first articulating arm and a second articulating arm . The actuator chassis is able to communicate with a jet fueldraulic actuator not shown located in a jet engine bay not shown such that the actuator can be removed from the jet engine bay. The actuator chassis is connectable to the actuator at three predetermined points on the actuator. The inclined plane section communicates with the actuator chassis . As shown in the inclined plane section has an inclined portion . In particular the actuator chassis communicates with the inclined portion . The first articulating arm communicates with the inclined plane section such that the actuator chassis can be moved left to right and adjusted to allow the actuator chassis to align and interface with the jet fueldraulic actuator. The second articulating arm communicates with the first articulating arm such that the actuator chassis to align and interface with the jet fueldraulic actuator. The second articulating arm communicates with the base .

The base is attachable to a universal jack such that the tool can be positioned by the universal jack . The universal jack primarily moves the actuator chassis as well as the tool in an up and down motion.

As seen in the actuator chassis includes a plate and an elbow extending from the plate . As stated earlier the three predetermined points on the actuator include a first point a second point and a third point. The plate has two attachment points allowing attachment to two of the three predetermined points on the actuator. In the preferred embodiment the plate has two pairs of plate projections each located at the first and the second points of attachment. The elbow has a first end and a second end . The first end of the elbow is attached to the plate while the second end of the elbow has an elbow attachment point for attachment to the other predetermined point on the actuator. In the preferred embodiment the elbow has a pair of elbow projections located at the elbow attachment point for attachment to the third point on the actuator. Each of the projections has a projection hole . For each pair of projections each pair together can be deemed to be an actuator chassis bushing system the projection holes correspond such that a pin can correspond with the projection holes and allow the actuator to be secured to the actuator chassis at the predetermined points. The actuator chassis may be manufactured from one continuous piece of metal. The actuator may be attached to the actuator chassis via the plate projections and elbow projections utilizing steel pins.

In the preferred embodiment the tool includes a bushing jack screw system wherein the inclined plane section the first articulating arm and the second articulating arm communicate with the bushing jack screw system such that locations of the first articulating arm and the second articulating arm can be moved such that the actuator chassis location can be adjusted.

The preferred embodiment of the bushing jack screw system is described herein. The inclined plane section has an inclined plane section pivot bushing system the first articulating arm has two first articulating arm pivot bushing systems the second articulating arm has a second articulating arm pivot bushing system . The tool further includes two adjustment jack screws a first adjustment jack screw and a second adjustment jack screw . The first adjustment jack screw communicates with the inclined plane section pivot bushing system and one of the first articulating arm pivot bushing systems such that the actuator chassis can be moved from left to right by manipulating the first adjustment jack screw . In the preferred embodiment the inclined section pivot bushing system is also pivotally attached to the first articulating arm via a first pivot bolt . The second adjustment jack screw communicates with other first articulating arm pivot bushing system and the second articulating arm pivot bushing system such that the actuator chassis can be moved from font to back frontwards and backwards by manipulating the second adjustment jack screw . In the preferred embodiment the other first articulating arm pivot bushing system the system communicating with the second articulating arm pivot bushing system is also pivotally attached to the second articulating arm via a second pivot bolt .

In the preferred embodiment each pivot bushing system includes a pair of corresponding rounded parallel bushing projections with an arbor . Within each bushing system the arbor axially extends across from one corresponding bushing projection to the other corresponding bushing projection with each of the bushing projections holding the arbor . The arbors are cylindrical in shape with a threaded arbor hole . The arbor hole is perpendicular to the cylindrical axis of the arbor . Each screw jack has two corresponding arbors disposed within the communicating pivot bushing systems. For instance the first adjustment jack screw corresponds to the arbor in the inclined plane section pivot bushing system and the arbor in one of the first articulating arm pivot bushing systems . The second adjustment jack screw corresponds to the arbor in the other first articulating arm pivot bushing system and the arbor in the second articulating arm pivot bushing system . For each jack screw one arbor in each corresponding arbor pair has a right hand threaded hole the opposing arbor has a reverse or left handed threaded hole. The cylindrical shape of the arbor corresponds to a hole that is bored in the corresponding bushing projections . Each screw jack has a middle section with a hexagonal cross section shape. Axially extending from the middle section are two partially threaded fingers disposed on opposite ends of the middle section . All three arm axially aligned all three axis lined up form a straight line . One finger has a right handed thread and the other finger has a left handed or reverse thread. The fingers are traded into the correspondingly threaded arbors holes . Each finger is threaded to a corresponding arbor . When adjustment jack screw is turned the pivot bushings system are either pushed further apart or pulled closer together due to the interaction of the threads. This causes the actuator chassis to move correspondingly.

As seen in the plate includes four plate holes that correspond to fasteners that connect the actuator chassis to the inclined plane section . The incline plane section particularly located on the inclined portion has four corresponding inclined plane section holes for accepting the fasteners . The fasteners can be screws bolts dowels or any type of fasteners that are practicable.
