title: Method and apparatus for starting supersonic compressors
abstract: A supersonic gas compressor with bleed gas collectors, and a method of starting the compressor. The compressor includes aerodynamic duct(s) situated for rotary movement in a casing. The aerodynamic duct(s) generate a plurality of oblique shock waves for efficiently compressing a gas at supersonic conditions. A convergent inlet is provided adjacent to a bleed gas collector, and during startup of the compressor, bypass gas is removed from the convergent inlet via the bleed gas collector, to enable supersonic shock stabilization. Once the oblique shocks are stabilized at a selected inlet relative Mach number and pressure ratio, the bleed of bypass gas from the convergent inlet via the bypass gas collectors is effectively eliminated.

This application relates to compressors for efficiently compressing various gases and more specifically method s for starting gas compressors for stable operation at supersonic conditions and to apparatus in which such method s are employed.

The development of improved highly efficient compression processes have become increasingly important in view of ever increasing costs for energy. Further in various power generation processes including some of those integrated with fuel synthesis processes the compression of residual or by product various gases including carbon dioxide is expected to become more important and increasingly prevalent as the call for sequestration of carbon dioxide becomes more urgent. Thus a reduction in gas compression costs by providing a gas compressor having high efficiency would be desirable in a variety of gas compression applications. When compressing high molecular weight gases energy reduction and thus cost reduction become especially important.

In general design methods associated with prior art supersonic compressors have encountered various difficulties. Some structures previously suggested have had or would have difficulty as a practical matter in ingesting an oblique leading edge shock pattern and thus have not been suitable for reliable starting in supersonic operation. Most such difficulties are problematic since in order to maintain low shock losses at increased relative Mach numbers the use of some sort of oblique shock system is generally required. However an oblique shock wave system is of value in supersonic gas compression since it ultimately enables the maintenance of an operational pre normal shock Mach number that is sufficiently low so that the total pressure loss at the terminal normal shock wave is minimized thus preserving efficiency.

As a consequence of trying to provide low loss supersonic shock compression while maintaining a self starting compressor design compressor designs have had a practical compression ratio upper limit. This is because the level of geometric contraction required to achieve a low loss supersonic compression process upstream of the normal shock wave results in a throat size i.e. the cross sectional flow area of minimum size of the aerodynamic duct in which supersonic compression occurs that will not start at inlet relative Mach numbers required to achieve pressure ratios above about 2.5 to 1. In other words in prior art designs known to me the area of the throat of a compression duct compared to the area of capture at the inlet of such compression has needed to remain relatively large roughly in the 85 range or higher in order to enable such a design to self start with respect to the supersonic shock waves attendant to such designs.

Due to the above mentioned limitations inherent in self starting supersonic compressor design a method for the design of a supersonic compressor that enables the simultaneous provision of high pressure ratios at least in the range above about 2.5 to 1 and moreover from that threshold up to a range of about 25 to 1 or more and with high adiabatic efficiency has not heretofore been provided.

Consequently there remains a need for a method of design for an easily started supersonic compressor that is capable of operating at high compression ratios in a stable and highly efficient manner under supersonic conditions. In order to meet such need and achieve and provide a method for the design of supersonic compressors that can achieve such operations it has become necessary to address the basic technical challenges by developing new methods for starting such a supersonic compressor system. Thus it would be advantageous to provide supersonic compressors that achieve supersonic shock capture in a suitably configured apparatus while providing very high gas compression efficiencies in normal operation. Moreover it would be advantageous to accomplish such goals while providing a compressor with high pressure ratios suitable for a single stage compressor design.

The foregoing figures being merely exemplary contain various elements that may be present or omitted from actual apparatus that may be constructed to practice the methods taught herein. An attempt has been made to draw the figures in a way that illustrates at least those elements that are significant for an understanding of the various methods taught herein for design construction and operation of high efficiency supersonic compressors. However various other elements for the design of supersonic compressors using removal of a portion of bypass gas for starting of the compressor may be utilized in order to provide a versatile gas compressor that minimizes or eliminates starting difficulties and or efficiency losses heretofore inherent in supersonic compressor designs.

An exemplary method for the design and construction of a high compression ratio and highly efficient supersonic gas compressor such as compressor depicted in is set forth herein. Throughout this specification there is discussion of the term inlet relative Mach number M as well as of a Mach number in the minimum cross sectional passageway or throat of an aerodynamic duct. For purposes of this specification unless expressly set forth otherwise or unless another interpretation is required by the specific context mentioned the various Mach numbers as discussed and described in detail herein are provided as mass averaged values wherein the term mass averaged means that the local Mach numbers throughout the flow area of interest are weighted by the local mass flow and are subsequently averaged by the total flow. Mathematically this expression can be described by the following equation 

Attention is directed to which provides a section view of an exemplary aerodynamic duct that provides a bounding passage in which supersonic compression occurs in a supersonic gas compressor see configured according to the design techniques taught herein. The aerodynamic duct includes a convergence inlet portion having a compression ramp that may be oriented to compress an incoming gas as designated by reference arrow in an outward direction as indicated by reference arrow which outward direction is at least partially radially outward with respect to the rotation of compressor. This can be appreciated by reference to as well as to both of which have been marked to depict the differential between radius R from a shaft centerline axis of rotation to a floor of an aerodynamic duct in a position upstream of compression ramp and radius R from a shaft centerline to a position on a compression ramp after at least some outward compression has been achieved .

Returning now to shown within the converging inlet portion is a plurality of oblique shock waves S S S etc. resulting from supersonic compression of a gas. The oblique shocks S S S etc. serve to efficiently reduce the velocity of the incoming gas while increasing its pressure and its temperature. During stable compressor operation at or near design conditions a stable normal shock wave S is positioned at a suitable location usually at or shortly after the gas passes through the minimum area cross sectional area designated as a throat in design terms used for aerodynamic ducts or more broadly as the gas emerges into or travels within a divergent outlet portion of the aerodynamic duct . In any event the design of the converging inlet portion of the aerodynamic duct is configured to produce a series of oblique shock waves S S S et cetera to shock wave Sx not shown wherein X is a positive integer which series of shock waves slows the inlet flow of captured gas in the converging inlet portion from a selected design point inlet relative Mach number to a Mach number of between about 1.2 and about 1.5 at a reference location prior to or at the location of a normal shock wave S. The selected design point inlet relative Mach number is selected of course at a value above the reduced Mach number at the reference location prior to or at the normal shock wave. For practical purposes useful inlet relative Mach numbers may be considered to be at about Mach 1.8 or higher or in another embodiment at about Mach 2 or higher or in another embodiment at about Mach 2.5 or higher. Techniques for the production of multiple oblique shock waves to accomplish such reduction in Mach number with an attendant increase in static pressure and static temperature is adequately described in various prior art patents and literature for example the techniques set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3 777 487 entitled Method and Apparatus for Reaction Propulsion issued Dec. 11 1973 to Norman et al which patent is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference should be more than sufficient to allow one of ordinary skill in the art and to which this specification is addressed to provide such multiple oblique shock waves in a suitable apparatus.

Further in exit conduits as defined by interior sidewalls are shown penetrating through first bounding portion of aerodynamic duct from a bounding side to an exit side . In other words a first bounding portion of aerodynamic duct includes perforations defined by interior sidewalls that provide exit conduits . These exit conduits are provided in sufficient size shape and quantity and consistent with acceptable and manageable aerodynamic loss as further discussed below in order to provide a bypass gas quantity within an acceptable range with respect to a selected design operating envelope as also further discussed below. For embodiments of practical commercial attention the sizing and quantity of such exit conduits provide for removal of a bypass gas quantity during startup which increases as the inlet relative Mach number increases. Further the bypass gas quantity required to be removed during starting as a function of a particular inlet relative Mach number is graphically set forth in . By cursory analysis of it can be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art to whom this specification is directed that the quantities of bypass gas removed for a given design operating envelope indicated as starting bleed fraction i.e. the ratio of mass of bleed bypass gas m to the mass of captured gas m entering one or more aerodynamic ducts is in excess and increasingly so at increasing inlet relative Mach number of an amount of bleed that might be used in an aerodynamic technique for boundary layer control for reducing aerodynamic loss at high speed operation during operation. More precisely the quantity of bypass gas fraction m m used at a selected inlet relative Mach number at a given design point in selected operating envelope may be bounded by 

Due to the presence of exit conduits when the compressor control system valve V is open see a quantity of bypass gas indicated by reference arrows migrates toward the exit conduits and thence through the exit conduits as indicated by reference arrows in and into bypass gas collectors . Thus a bypass gas passageway see is provided that is of increasing capacity i.e. can conduct more mass given the conditions of size gas temperature differential pressure etc. as the inlet relative Mach number increases as generally graphically depicted in for example. The bypass gas collectors direct the bypass gas away from the aerodynamic duct by in one embodiment as seen in directing the bypass gas through further bypass gas passageways toward the low pressure gas inlet of the compressor . As can be appreciated from the cross sectional view in and from the exploded perspective view provided in in an embodiment the bypass gas collectors are configured in a generally parallelepiped shape as defined by a a bottom or floor that is provided by exit side of a first bounding portion of aerodynamic duct see b opposing collector boards and more specifically a flow preventive collector board on one side and an overflow collector board on the other side over which bypass gas flows as noted by reference arrow in c opposing ribs and d a ceiling provided by a portion of the interior of rotor shroud . In an embodiment the inlet to the bypass gas collectors is defined by exit conduits . In an embodiment the outlet to bypass gas collectors is defined a axially along opposing ribs and b radially between the upper end of overflow collector board and an interior roof portion of ceiling of interior of rotor shroud .

Other structural details of the aerodynamic duct include a second bounding portion shown at the throat and downstream as a roof in the diverging outlet portion . In an embodiment along the diverging outlet portion the use of ribs may be maintained for connection to the rotor shroud . In an embodiment opposing the floor upstream of compression ramp a third bounding portion may be provided similarly using opposing ribs and rotor shroud .

Overall operation of a shrouded wheel supersonic compressor is as shown in A B and C is in many respects similar to the unshrouded compressor wheel design illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 7 293 955 issued Nov. 13 2007 to Lawlor et. al for a Supersonic Gas Compressor the disclosure of which including the specification drawing figures and claims is incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference. More specifically a compressor wheel rotates in the direction of reference arrow as noted in . As seen in in an embodiment one or more helical strakes K are provided adjacent each of one or more compression ramps . In one embodiment the one or more helical strakes K extend from leading edge . Helical strakes K have a height Khave inlet interior walls Kand outlet interior walls Kthat form lateral bounds of passageway provided by aerodynamic duct . Compression ramp and first bounding portion form radial bounds for a portion of the passageway provided by aerodynamic duct . Similarly throat and floor of diverging outlet portion act with second bounding portion to form radial bounds for a portion of the passageway provided by aerodynamic duct .

Strakes K effectively separate the low pressure inlet gas from high pressure compressed gas downstream at each one of the aerodynamic ducts . In an embodiment strakes K are provided in a generally helical structure extending radially outward from an outer surface portion of rotor to an outward bounding region of the passageways provided by aerodynamic ducts . As noted above in an embodiment first bounding portion and second bounding portion form a significant portion of such outward bounding region. In an embodiment the third bounding portion may also provide a portion of such outward bounding region. In an embodiment the number of strakes K is equal to the number of compression ramps . In an embodiment a compression ramp may be provided for each aerodynamic duct . The number of aerodynamic ducts may be selected as appropriate for the required service gas being compressed mass flow pressure ratio etc. as most advantageous for a given service. In some embodiments the number of aerodynamic ducts provided for rotary motion on a single stage rotor may be 3 or 5 or 7 or 9.

As shown in during starting compressor via valve V in a compressor control system opens a bypass gas passageway between the aerodynamic duct and the low pressure gas inlet . A selected quantity of bypass gas is thus routed from the aerodynamic duct to the low pressure gas inlet . Once the compressor reaches a stable operating condition with the oblique shock waves stabilized then the bypass gas is reduced and ultimately eliminated thus enabling the compressor to operate at high pressure ratios while maintaining high efficiency.

As earlier noted above provides a graphic illustration of a suitable range for starting bypass gas removal requirements noted on the vertical axis as starting bleed fraction defined by mass of bypass gas bleed divided by mass of inlet gas captured for a aerodynamic duct for a supersonic compressor operating at a selected inlet relative Mach number. Thus for a desired target inlet relative Mach number the bypass gas removal passageways including exit conduits and bypass gas collectors need to be sized and shaped to receive therethrough the required quantity of bypass gas. With respect to selection of a desired target inlet relative Mach number provides the range of inlet relative Mach numbers achievable by some embodiments for a compressor configured according to the teachings herein.

In addition to the embodiment for an aerodynamic duct as noted in above other configurations may be feasible and several additional embodiments are noted herein for providing advantageous wheel mounted bounding passageways for supersonic compression.

Attention is directed to wherein a cross sectional view of an embodiment for a compressor utilizing a rotor that has thereon aerodynamic duct s as just described above in the discussion with respect to . At time of starting not illustrated functionally in but rather in the exit conduits positioned in the floor side of aerodynamic duct s accept therethrough an amount of bypass gas as indicated by reference arrow . A bypass gas passageway is provided that has a selected design size of increasing gas flow capacity i.e. can conduct more mass given the conditions of passageway physical size gas temperature differential pressure etc. as the design inlet relative Mach number increases. The bypass gas sent through exit conduits in the floor located bypass gas collectors see is directed away from the aerodynamic duct s as indicated by reference arrow and into lower bypass gas passageway . In an embodiment as seen in the collected bypass gas as indicated by reference arrow passes through further portions of bypass gas passageways and travels through valve then through lower bypass gas outlet and on toward the low pressure gas inlet of the compressor .

Similarly in yet another embodiment for an exemplary aerodynamic duct is provided for use in a supersonic gas compressor such as compressor . In this figure use of opposing compression ramps and is indicated in converging inlet . The compression ramp structure is oriented to compress gas at least partially radially inward as indicated by reference arrow . Compression ramp is oriented to compress gas at least partially radially outward as indicated by reference arrow . Efficient compression is accomplished utilizing a plurality of oblique shock waves S S S and S S S etc. which serve to efficiently reduce the velocity of the incoming gas while increasing pressure and temperature. For starting in such an embodiment exit conduits and are provided and bypass gas collectors and are provided functionally and structurally these are substantially the same as noted above with respect to the exit conduits and the collectors described in detail in relation to .

Attention is directed to wherein a cross sectional view of an embodiment for a compressor utilizing a rotor that has thereon aerodynamic duct s as just described above in the discussion with respect to . At time of starting not illustrated functionally in but rather in the exit conduits and positioned in the roof side compression ramp and in the floor side compression ramp respectively accept therethrough bypass gas as indicated by reference arrows and respectively. The bypass gas as indicated by reference arrows sent through exit conduits in the roof located bypass gas collectors is directed away from the aerodynamic duct and into bypass gas passageway . The collected bypass gas as indicated by reference arrow passes through further portions of bypass gas passageways and travels toward the low pressure gas inlet of the compressor . The lower bypass gas passageway is provided that has a selected design size of increasing gas flow capacity i.e. can conduct more mass given the conditions of passageway physical size gas temperature differential pressure etc. as the design inlet relative Mach number increases. The bypass gas sent through exit conduits in the bypass gas collectors see located in floor is directed away from the aerodynamic duct s as indicated by reference arrow and into lower bypass gas passageway . In an embodiment as seen in the collected bypass gas as indicated by reference arrow passes through further portions of bypass gas passageways and travels through valve then through lower bypass gas outlet and on toward the low pressure gas inlet of the compressor .

In any event once the gas being compressed passes the aerodynamic duct or other suitable embodiments such as described in or in the high speed compressed gas exits the rotor through a passageway as indicated by reference arrow and then in an embodiment may pass through an array of diffusers and as indicated by reference arrow before entering a volute as indicated by reference arrows in which the velocity slows and static pressure is accumulated.

The compressor described herein may be utilized for compression of various gases. Benefits of using such a compressor design are especially seen with gases in which the speed of sound at standard aerodynamic conditions 1 atmosphere 60 F. is at or about that of nitrogen or lower. Also gases with high molecular weight may be compressed with compressors designed as set forth herein with significant benefit especially when handling those gases with a molecular weight of nitrogen or higher. Some of such gases may include hydrocarbons such as ethane propane butane pentane and hexane as well as other high molecular weight compounds such as carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide or very high molecular weight compounds such as uranium hexafluoride.

In short compressors provided according to the designs provided herein are particularly well suited to applications involving gases with low sound speeds where high pressure ratios are required such as carbon dioxide or propane where high Mach number compression designs are advantageous. For example compression of carbon dioxide to a discharge pressure of from between about 1500 psia to about 2200 psia can be accomplished in a cost effective manner. Similarly propane compression for natural gas liquefaction requires propane compression at pressure ratios of from about 16 1 to about 50 1 depending upon the details of the process selected. The combination of relatively low speed of sound in propane and high pressure ratios required make such service an ideal candidate for the compressor designs taught herein.

For most designs of compressors according to the teachings herein at the design operating point the Mach number before a normal shock at the design position location is in a range of from about 1.2 to about 1.5.

High efficiency at high gas compression ratio is one hallmark of the most advantageous portions of a design operating envelope achievable by compressors designed as taught herein. However compressors may be provided wherein the design operating envelope comprises a gas compression ratio of at least 3.

While the exact design of an aerodynamic duct may vary in various design configurations for ease of construction it may be useful and save materials weight and space if the bypass gas collectors are at least partially defined by a floor exit side that is also an exterior portion of a third bounding portion of an aerodynamic duct as shown in . As better seen in the bypass gas collectors may also be at least partially defined by axially oriented and radially extending opposing ribs . Also the bypass gas collectors may be at least partially defined by opposing collector boards said opposing collector boards provided in pairs wherein an upstream collector board substantially prevents flow of bypass gas thereby and wherein a downstream collector board defines at least a portion of a bypass gas outlet from the bypass gas collector .

In a method for starting a supersonic gas compressor a compressor is provided including a rotor having one or more aerodynamic ducts mounted for rotary movement wherein the aerodynamic ducts have converging inlet portions and diverging outlet portions. The aerodynamic ducts include one or more structures that at supersonic inflow conditions generate oblique shock waves in a gas within the converging inlet portion and a normal shock wave in a gas as said gas enters or passes through the diverging outlet portion. The aerodynamic duct provided has an inlet relative Mach number for operation associated with a design operating point selected within a design operating envelope for a selected gas composition gas quantity and gas compression ratio. A method of starting includes initiating engagement of the converging inlet portion of the aerodynamic ducts with an inlet gas stream to be compressed. Then a selected quantity of bypass gas is removed from the converging inlet portion as the aerodynamic duct increases in velocity while the gas therein transforms from a subsonic inflow condition to a supersonic condition at an inlet relative Mach number associated with a design operating point. The selected quantity of bypass gas removed increases as the inlet relative Mach number increases as selected for the desired design operating point. Generally the quantity of bypass gas removed is selected from a range of a from about 11 by mass to about 19 by mass of the inlet gas captured by the converging inlet portion for operation at an inlet relative Mach number of about 1.8 to b from about 36 by mass to about 61 by mass of the inlet gas captured by the converging inlet portion for operation at an inlet relative Mach number of about 2.8. Exemplary operating conditions for such bypass gas removal amounts are suggested in . When the oblique shock waves are effectively stabilized within the design operating envelope of the supersonic gas compressor the removal of a quantity of bypass gas from the converging inlet portion is effectively eliminated. In an embodiment the removal of said bypass gas is completely terminated after the aerodynamic duct has reached a selected inlet relative Mach number for the design operating point. Thereafter normal operation of the compressor occurs without removal of bypass gas.

In one aspect the compressor startup method taught herein may be practiced in a compressor configuration wherein one of the converging inlet portions comprise exit conduits therein and wherein removal of the bypass flow is conducted by removing gas through such exit conduits .

In short the novel supersonic gas compressor described and claimed herein and the method and apparatus for starting the same can provide a significant benefit in compressor designs for high efficiency operation. The supersonic gas compressor described and claimed herein may be utilized to compress a variety of suitable gases. In an embodiment such a compressor may be utilized to compress carbon dioxide. In another embodiment the compressor may be utilized to compress propane.

In summary whether for application for carbon dioxide sequestration air separation hydrocarbon processing or other gas compression operation and especially for gases having low sonic velocities and or high molecular weights a novel supersonic gas compressor design has now been developed. Initial calculations have indicated that significant improvements in efficiency may be attained in such a design. And an important consideration is that efficiency is increased since after starting using a significant bleed fraction the bleed amount is reduced to little or nothing i.e. essentially zero as the compressor design and especially the rotor design is able to achieve stable operation in a desired very high compression ratio design range without ongoing removal of bypass bleed gas.
