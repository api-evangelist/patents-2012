No. 12 435 944 claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 050 419 entitled Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Decision Support System filed on May 5 2008 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Aspects of the present invention relate to decision support systems and more particularly to decision support systems that employ hybrid rules based and case based reasoning.

Decision support systems DSSs are typically designed to provide users with near real time access to complex bodies of knowledge. Often the users of DSSs are themselves experts in the bodies of knowledge at which the DSS is targeted and these users harness the DSS to better apply their knowledge to a particular set of facts. Thus conventional DSSs accept a set of facts and based on these facts and the content of the pertinent body of knowledge provide potential conclusions drawn from application of the pertinent body of knowledge.

A DSS may be broadly categorized according to how the DSS stores and applies or reasons with a body of knowledge. Conventionally there are at least three such categorizes of DSS reasoning. These categories include rule based reasoning RBR case based reasoning CBR and hybrid RBR CBR. RBR uses facts derived from a well constructed domain theory to produce knowledge. In rules based systems rules stored in the form of logical implications or if then statements form the building blocks of the decision making process.

CBR recognizes the power of individual solutions and solves problems by retrieving cases from a database of prior cases and adapting the solutions of the retrieved cases to fit the use case data. In CBR instead of using general domain knowledge to solve a current case specific knowledge from previous cases is used. Conventionally CBR systems share the following cycle 

Conventionally cases are represented using a variety of data structures. One popular technique is the dynamic memory model where cases with similar structure are organized in a general structure known as a generalized episode GE . A GE contains norms which are features common to all cases and indices which are features that discriminated between cases. Another popular technique is the category and exemplar model which organizes the cases in a network of categories semantic relationships cases and index pointers.

Conventional case indexing schemes include case indexing by the features with the most predictive power difference based indexing and explanation based generalization methods. When indexing by the features with the most predictive power features that are responsible for providing a solution to the case are indexed. Difference based indexing uses indices that differentiate cases from other similar cases. Explanation based generalization methods form an abstract case from common features and the abstract case is indexed via these common features.

A number of CBR systems have been developed in both industry and academia. These CBR systems include CBR Express ART Enterprise from Inference Corporation which are used primarily for help desk applications Remind from Cognitive Systems Inc. and ReCall from ISoft. Non commercial CBR systems for specific applications such as clinical audiology heart failure and meal planning have also been developed.

Hybrid RBR CBR systems developed in response to the deficiencies of RBR and CBR when each is applied individually. Systems using this reasoning approach typically marshal reasoning activates between RBR and CBR engines in an attempt to reap the benefits of both.

According to some aspects of the invention it is appreciated that in a clinical care environment clinicians are required to make decisions based on partial information and identify salient clues in a maze of clinical data. When available traditional evidence based knowledge and standardized guides may support off line clinical decisions however there is a significant need for real time access to evidence based knowledge. In addition despite the fact that modern hospitals are well equipped with patient monitoring and data collection devices salient patient data to a large extent remain unutilized for information extraction purposes related to patient care.

In broad overview aspects and embodiments disclosed herein provide for a system that overcomes or alleviates some of the problems associated with conventional DSSs and that may identify new knowledge not yet considered in a clinical situation. Embodiments may provide for decision support systems that utilize CBR and RBR to a represent patient case bases in a compact way that captures frequency of appearance of both cases and rules so that information may be harvested efficiently b implement a quality metric for case usefulness that is based on tracking of case look up and actual case usage in new problems c employ useful cases to update the importance of rules in the rule based engine and d employ a similarity metric that encompasses semantic temporal and quantitative aspects of cases while also taking into account ontological relationships.

Other embodiments provide for a clinical DSS that utilizes RBR integrated with multi context CBR. The DSS may be an evidence based system and the system may be individualized to a specific patient and integrated with the flow of clinical practice. The system may serve to reduce risk and identify clinical problems in an early stage by minimizing decision errors of omission in situations of clinical uncertainty.

The distributed systems illustrated by may include numerous components each of which has a specific function to perform in the context of a patient care episode. As shown system includes a data search collection engine a data fusion engine an electronic health record EHR data warehouse a case query engine a rule query engine a case base a rule base a case miner a rule miner a decision tree constructor and an NCODES runtime engine .

Information may flow between the elements components and subsystems depicted in using any technique. Such techniques include for example passing the information over the network via TCP IP passing the information between modules in memory and passing the information by writing to a file database or some other non volatile storage device. In addition pointers or other references to information may be transmitted and received in place of or in addition to copies of the information. Conversely the information may be exchanged in place of or in addition to pointers or other references to the information. Other techniques and protocols for communicating information may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.

In the embodiment shown the data search collection engine receives semantic diagnostic information and provides that information to data fusion engine . The data fusion engine receives semantic diagnostic information clinical path flow information patient clinical information and patient historic EHR information and provides this information to EHR data warehouse . The data fusion engine is described in greater detail below with regard to . The EHR data warehouse houses a variety of information including formal knowledge experimental knowledge and observational knowledge. The EHR data warehouse provides information to both the case query engine and the rule query engine .

In the embodiment shown the case query engine organizes and indexes this information by case and provides the organized and indexed case information to the case base . In a similar fashion the rule query engine organizes and indexes the information provided by the EHR data warehouse by rule and provides the organized and indexed rule information to the rule base . In addition the case query engine may exchange i.e. both receive and provide information with the rule query engine .

As depicted by the case base provides case information to the case miner and the decision tree constructor . The rule base provides rule information to the rule miner and the decision tree constructor . Both the case miner and the rule miner respectively mine the case base and the rule base for information using a variety of data mining techniques. For instance according to at least one embodiment illustrated by the case miner and the rule miner employ among others techniques frequency pattern matching.

Frequent pattern fp tree building is a technique used in frequency pattern mining of databases. According to frequent pattern tree building efficiency of mining is achieved by compressing a database of transactions into a compact structure with the most frequent items close to the root of the tree. Under this structure multiple scans of the database are avoided because when a number of database transactions share an identical set of items they may be merged into a generalized transaction. This generalized transaction may include an attribute termed a count that indicates the number of transactions that share the common item sets.

According to various embodiments illustrated by the decision tree constructor builds clinical decision support trees. In some embodiments these trees include frequent case FC and frequent rule FR trees. Both of these tree types are discussed further below. In addition the decision tree constructor exchanges information including decision support trees with the NCODES runtime engine . The NCODES runtime engine supports a variety of client related data manipulation functions such as receiving active clinical case information and providing a variety of user interfaces to clinicians.

According to various embodiments system may operate in a client server configuration with the server performing computationally significant tasks such as the functions performed by the data fusion engine the case query engine and the rule query engine and the client performing user data entry and client specific decision support tasks. The engines shown in provide support for the search extraction transformation and fusion of domain knowledge into multiple domain specific ontologies.

In the embodiment shown the data fusion engine includes several knowledge base data integration agents. These integration agents may include among other agents a guideline based knowledge agent a literature based knowledge agent an outcomes based knowledge agent a patient specific based knowledge agent and a knowledge evolution agent. As illustrated these integration agents each receive and parse information from a data source and process in conjunction with the knowledge evolution agent the data for storage in one or more ontologies included in the ontologies database . In the embodiment shown the data sources that supply data to the integration agents include established medical guidelines literature case analysis and patient EHR analysis. Other embodiments may include other integration agents and other data sources without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The ontologies built by the data fusion engine may help to establish a common representation and understanding of domain knowledge from a variety of levels. They may aid in separating domain knowledge from operational knowledge characterize constraints concerning the use of data objects establish correspondence or relationships between different domains and aid in defining data provenance pedigree lineage relevance localization accuracy and timeliness of extracted information. According to the embodiment shown the collected annotated and or fused information may be stored in a domain data warehouse referred to in as the HIMS data warehouse for use within the system.

With combined reference to in some embodiments the HIMS data warehouse may be used by the rule and case query engines and to extract diagnosis related group DRG specific information and to construct generic and patient specific cases which may include patient care event sequences. This may be followed by construction of derived case composite rules both generic and patient specific. The results of this phase of operation may be stored into the rule and case bases and in the form of ontology instances for either a rule or an entire case. These stored information elements may then used to build frequent case FC and frequent rule FR trees which are discussed further below.

The databases and may take the form of any logical construction capable of storing information on a computer readable medium including flat files indexed files hierarchical databases relational databases or object oriented databases. In addition links pointers indicators and other references to data may be stored in place of or in addition to actual copies of the data. The data may be modeled using unique and foreign key relationships and indices. The unique and foreign key relationships and indices may be established between the various fields and tables to ensure both data integrity and data interchange performance. Also according to various embodiments the databases and may be individual databases or combined into one or more databases. For example according to one embodiment the EHR data warehouse and the HIMS data warehouse are incorporated into a single database.

The illustrated clinical process model begins operations in act with a patient s entry into a system based on recognition of symptoms and initial entry by a clinician or other user. In one embodiment the system may then execute an initial assessment module that upon detecting a new patient identity would extract the patient s health history from the knowledge base and the HIMS data warehouse . The system may then accept user requests to assess patient symptoms or provide interventions for consideration if a diagnosis has already been determined During initial assessment the system may use the clinical DSS to query the clinician for measurement and entry of a variety of typical symptoms. Symptoms may be used along with the patient s health history to initiate matching to prior cases including similar symptoms using suitable rules.

Similarity searches may be initiated using various techniques. In one embodiment rules may be used to search for similar cases following DRG situated decision trees where the DRGs are specified by the clinician. There may be two types of such trees FR trees and FC trees. According to another embodiment similar cases may be found by following FC trees to the leaves which include DRGs. FR trees FC trees and FC trees with DRGs included in leaves will be discussed further below. If initial assessment does not produce an acceptable match further testing and exams may be requested to further refine the possible diagnosis.

In one embodiment once a refined assessment has been completed in act the system may use past patient history an ontological stored DRG and case and rule prioritizations along with stored case and rule instances to isolate to the most probable diagnosis. Using these diagnoses salient interventions may be proposed in act along with hypothesized outcomes for the clinician to select based on ontological presented best evidence. Upon intervention selection the system may wait in act for inputs from intervention symptom measurements to be used in assessing the effectiveness of a selected intervention. Upon completion of intervention assessment the system may detect changes in act by performing an outcome assessment which looks to match actual patient symptoms against those of past patients and ontological norms for determination of a positive or negative outcome. If a positive result is found the case may be added to the data store and data structures such as FC trees FR trees and related indices may be updated in act . Likewise if a negative result is found data structures and indices may be altered to negatively highlight the case in act .

As stated above according to some embodiments cases may be represented in FR and FC trees. In these trees the pathways may be constructed based on the descending frequency of cases or case attributes such as rules. Attributes of the case may include patient data such as temperature values blood pressure values and or patient symptoms such as chest pain. In an embodiment the procedure for the construction of the tree may be similar to the construction of an fp tree as described above. To date fp trees have not been used for the organization of cases in case based reasoning or for iterative growth of frequent patterns. In some embodiments the case base may be divided in DRGs and each group may have its own FC tree and FR tree. In addition there may be FC trees that exist outside a DRG space which are termed non DRG FC trees.

Within DRG FR trees may exist within a DRG. For example there may be an FR tree for the DRG pneumonia and a separate tree for the DRG emphysema. illustrates data structures including an FR tree according to various embodiments. In addition illustrates the relationship between the FR tree and an IR index and an FR index . The IR index orders rules by rule risk factor weight i.e. their ability to confirm or exclude a high risk prognosis. According to some embodiments the rule risk rate is received from the HIMS data warehouse . The FR index orders rules by frequency of occurrence within the case base . In the embodiment shown the most frequent attributes such as rules interventions and outcome assessments of DRG may be R R R R R and R in that order. The FR tree may be organized as a set of nodes representing the rules encountered during the processing of a given patient care episode or case. The node counts may represent the number of individual cases which have utilized a specific attribute such as a rule in determining the appropriate diagnosis intervention and outcome sequence. The leaves of the tree may represent one or more instances of a given complete case. The cases may be stored in the database and indices to them may be stored at the leaves.

The cases at the leaf nodes may be positive or negative exemplars of the DRG. For example a case at the end of the path R R R in may have all these attributes and exhibit pneumonia or have all these attributes and exhibit another condition such as asthma. According to this embodiment cases may constitute entries into other DRG trees that the clinician should consider due to the strong similarity of the DRGs.

To aid in discovering which DRG tree to further investigate for similarity embodiments may store case frequencies and related DRGs as an alternative FC tree. These trees may include merged cases that span many DRGs and the number of spanned DRGs may decrease as the tree is traversed towards its leaves. The leaves of these trees may include specific DRGs. For example in such a tree fever and cough constitute a merged case near the top of the tree.

The aforementioned non DRG tree may help in the construction of another type of tree i.e. FC trees within DRGs. In an embodiment FC trees within DRGs may be constructed by identifying which case is most heavily represented in a given DRG which collection of cases are related within a DRG by traversing the path from root to leaf and or which sequences of cases for a specific patient s show up with regularity. These FC trees may indicate possible trends to consider for patient care.

According to various embodiments a computer system may perform multi context case indexing where a case is indexed under a number of different contexts. These context indices may include among other indices semantic quantitative temporal qualitative ontological and temporally ontological. Semantic indexing may indicate the DRG that the case belongs to as discussed with regard to above. Quantitative indexing includes indexing of symptoms and patient data values at the time the case was recorded as discussed with regard to the rule nodes in above. Both semantic indexing and quantitative indexing are discussed further below.

Ontological indexing may be based on clinical term taxonomies and it may put a case in different classes such as a medication class an interventions class etc. For example a case with the Advil medication index may also have the pain reliever ontological index.

Temporal indexing may describe the history for the patient and may include temporal attributes i.e. attributes with a start and end time that represent temporal events and or attributes with a single time that represent temporal occurrences. For example temporal indexing of a case may be age date of birth Mar. 9 1931 heart attack Jun. 15 1999 heart attack related hospitalization Jun. 15 1999 to Jul. 20 1999 diabetes diagnosed Sep. 1 2000 Glucotrol medication Sep. 1 2000 to Jun. 5 2002 severe hypoglycemic episode Mar. 10 2001 severe hypoglycemic episode Mar. 10 2002 severe hypoglecemic episode Mar. 10 2003 and Glucophage medication June 2002 to present . Temporal indices may be stored as separate dimension table indices on warehoused fact tables. This indexing scheme may allow a system to extract build and analyze trends for a specific patient related to a new care event.

Temporally ontological indexing may be used to indicate trends and durations of temporal attributes. For example the above patient history may have the following temporally ontological indexing hospitalization that lasted for more than a week frequent hypoglecemic episodes on Glucophage medication for five years Glucotrol medication ended on it for 2 years . Such data may be stored in the specific EHR for a specific patient which is part of the EHR data warehouse .

Qualitative indexing may indicate how useful the case has been in providing consultation in previous cases. Each case may have a hit count index and a link count index where a hit means that the case was found similar by the system to an incoming patient case and presented to the user. A link means that the case was affirmed to have actually provided a useful recommendation for an incoming patient case. Each case may also have a quality ranking Q which will be a function of the hits links and outcome of the case. A potential form of the function is sum of links sum of hits Outcome

where Outcome is a numerical indication of the case s outcome. High quality cases include those with a good outcome for example quick hospital discharge and with many links. Low quality cases include cases with many hits and a few links. According to one embodiment the system may also provide link propagation in the sense that the link count under a specific context of the case gets incremented if cases that contain its link become links for other cases for the same context.

According to one embodiment the system may provide for multi context similarity computation. At the end of the similarity computation process rules from the top K most similar cases may be displayed to the user where K is the number that may be configured by the user. The rules may be an intervention a diagnosis or need for additional assessment depending on the stage of the patient assessment. The similarity between the current patient case and the retrieved patient cases may be computed under different contexts and presented to the user as the Quality Controlled Similarity Vote which is computed as follows F Semantic Similarity Quantitative Similarity Temporal Similarity Q 

where F is a function of the similarity sum and the quality ranking Q. For example if the quality ranking is a number A and the above sum is indicated as S then a possible function is SA or S A or S A. The different types of similarity may be computed as described below.

Semantic similarity may be computed based on the DRG. If the current patient case diagnosis is diabetes then the case may be considered similar to cases within the diabetes DRG. In the case of multiple simultaneous DRGs such as for example diabetes and neuropathy then the case may be considered similar to cases within the diabetes DRG and cases within the neuropathy DRG. The clinician may indicate on the system whether diagnosis is determined or not. If the diagnosis of the current case is uncertain then semantic similarity may not play a role. Semantic similarity may also have an ontological dimension in the sense that cases that are related taxonomically may also have a degree of similarity in the system. For example bronchitis and asthma may have a degree of similarity because they both are subclasses of the respiratory disease class.

The next context is quantitative where embodiments may compute the similarity between individual features of the current case and features of the retrieved case with a formula similar to the similarity equation in the background section. Features may include symptoms such as fatigue or cough and patient data values such as high glucose level and temperature and or interventions such as insulin administration. In one embodiment the weights of the features are based upon their risk factor. Note that the same feature may have a different weight within different DRGs. For example cough for an otherwise healthy patient with nasal allergies may have a different weight than for a patient with congestive heart failure. If the current patient has a suspected or confirmed DRG quantitative similarity of the current case may be computed with cases at the leaves of the DRGs FR tree. These leaves may be found at the end of a path that contains the attributes of the current case. As mentioned above at the leaves of the FR tree there may be not only cases that belong to this DRG such as positive exemplars but also cases that do not belong to this DRG that contain all the attributes of the path. Therefore quantitative similarity may be computed with these cases as well.

Temporal similarity may be computed for cases with a high enough quantitative vote. Temporal similarity may compute the similarity of the current case s patient history and retrieved cases patient history. Because temporal information is complex temporal similarity may be guided by the user to look for the right piece of information in the temporal and temporal ontological indices. For example in a case of a patient where hospitalization is in its 10th day the clinician may enter hospitalization duration to guide the temporal search and the system may retrieve for similarity computation among others cases with the temporal ontological index hospitalization more than a week. In another example for a diabetic patient currently on Avandia the user may enter similar medications in the last three years. The system may use medication ontologies and may bring up histories of patients on Avandia and Actos which is a similar substance and may translate the last 3 years into a start and end date to obtain the appropriate temporal indices.

In one embodiment the system may enter the new patient case in the case base and update the link and hit count of cases that contributed to a clinical decision. Specifically in one embodiment a case A may be linked as a contributor to the diagnosis of a new case B if the following is true a case A is found similar by the system to case B b the diagnosis of case A is presented to the user as a potential choice and c a similar diagnosis for case B was confirmed by the user. Similarly a case A may be linked as a contributor to the choice of an intervention of a new case B if the following is true a case A is found similar by the system to case B b the intervention of case A is presented to the user as a potential choice for case B and c a similar intervention is chosen for case B. Similarity here also may have an ontological dimension. Cases whose rules were presented to the user but that did not contribute to the solution of the case may get an incremented hit count. In addition the system may indicate in the record of the new case an identifier of the case that contributed to its solution to allow link propagation in the future.

According to another embodiment an intelligent agent may be utilized to evolve the case base by performing a process including the following acts among others. The agent may monitor new cases to obtain or update the outcome. The duration of this monitoring activity may range from a few hours to months. The agent may update the frequencies and reorganize the FR and FC trees of the DRG trees as new cases are introduced to the system. The agent may update the indices as new medical information becomes available such as new medications or temporal constraints as might be driven by performance demands for example. The agent may bring to the attention of the clinician rules such as choice of specific interventions that are included in cases with a high hit count and very small or zero link count. This combined with a possible negative outcome may indicate a potentially problematic rule.
