This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61 496 772 filed on Jun. 14 2011 the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference.

The disclosed systems and methods relate to authentication. More particularly the disclosed systems and methods relate to the authentication of objects using various parameter value sensors for discerning attributes of an object and a data processing system and associated data storage for comparing sensed parameters to stored criteria that are associated with authenticity.

Counterfeit goods are damaging to the owners of name brand products as well as damaging to unknowing purchasers of such goods. For example brand name owners or manufacturers suffer as they lose out on revenue from the sale of counterfeit goods and such goods can also damage the reputation of the brand name owner if the goods are shoddily made. Consumers can be damaged by unknowingly over paying for counterfeit goods that they believe are authentic.

In some embodiments a system includes a machine readable storage medium a processor in communication with the machine readable storage medium communication circuitry in communication with the processor and a plurality of sensors in communication with the processor. Each of the plurality of sensors is configured to generate an electrical signal in response to receiving wave energy. The processor is configured to control data acquisition for authenticating an object using at least a subset of the plurality of sensors calculate an authentication value based on signals received from the subset of the plurality of sensors and cause the communication circuitry to transmit an authentication request including the authentication value to an authentication entity.

In some embodiments an authentication method includes performing a plurality of data acquisition processes on an object using sensors configured to generate electrical signals in response to receiving wave energy calculating an authentication value based on signals received from at least a subset of the sensors and transmitting an authentication request including the authentication value to an authentication entity.

In some embodiments a machine readable storage medium is encoded with program code wherein when the program code is executed by a processor the processor performs a method. The method includes performing a plurality of data acquisition processes on an object using sensors configured to generate electrical signals in response to receiving wave energy calculating an authentication value based on signals received from at least a subset of the sensors and transmitting an authentication request including the authentication value to an authentication entity.

This description of the exemplary embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings which are to be considered part of the entire written description.

The disclosed systems and methods advantageously provide the ability to authenticate objects referred to herein as authentic real things ART using mobile and stationary devices. The number and type of objects that can be authenticated are not limited and examples of such objects include but are not limited to apparel footwear fashion accessories consumer electronics consumer appliances collectibles dolls sport paraphernalia etc. pharmaceuticals medical devices and large assemblies like cars trucks and planes to list but only a few possibilities.

In some embodiments WAAL s are implemented using one or more computers or servers on which database and SC are implemented. Database can be implemented as a relational database that stores data of ART that are used to define True Artifacts TAs that are described in greater detail below. Version history information lineage and other details about an ART and TA for validation and tracking are also stored in database .

SC includes one or more processors and software and or program s configured to manage the communication indexing activities and functions of the WAAL . Examples of such functions include but are not limited to authentication calculations registration and record management of TAs and their respective digital fingerprints communications with ITRs and PPLs and generating reports and analytics to users of local terminals or remote terminals . In some embodiments SC provides an application programming interface API for WAAL . The API provides for access and bulk processing of a large number of requests from ITRs and PPLs . Online retailers such as online retailer can access database and have WAAL authenticate goods via network by communicating with WAAL via the API.

SC is configured to perform analytics on data stored in database and or on data received from ITRs and or PPLs via network . Such analytics involve determining whether attributes or combinations of attributes of objects which attributes have been sensed or reported qualify the objects as authentic real things ART or as true artifacts TA . In addition to comparing sensed or reported attributes versus stored values that definitively distinguish objects such as a unique identifying code the analytics can involve plural attributes and can be implemented using one or more techniques including but not limited to pattern matching artificial intelligence optical recognition key marking fuzzy logic chaos theory entropic intelligence networks Bayesian network s and quantum physics.

As described in greater detail below data received at WAAL and analyzed by SC can be derived from an interrogation of one or more added indelible markers AIMs such as for example radio frequency identification RFID tag s product serial number s transponder identification numbers doping agents barcodes quick response QR codes invisible ink s software keys certificates of authenticity codes colors sounds and combinations thereof by ITRs . Such data is combined to provide a unique identification for the ART referred to herein as an Immutable Token IT of the ART. In some embodiments SC performs weighting of AIMs of an ART to calculate the IT.

In some embodiments the weighting of AIMs is based on the likelihood that the AIMs can be forged or counterfeited. For example the physical appearance of an article of manufacture e.g. a shirt bag pair of shoes etc. can be somewhat easily copied or replicated whereas an RFID tag number and a manufacturer serial number are less likely to match an authentic RFID tag number and manufacturer serial number affixed to an object during manufacture. Consequently the RFID tag number and manufacturer serial number can be more heavily weighted than the physical appearance of an object. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art taking all available AIM values into account increases the certainty that an object is authentic.

Additionally the physical appearance of authentic goods may vary due to the manufacturing process and the use of multiple AIMs also reduces the likelihood that an authentic item is falsely identified as being counterfeit. For example colors and the location of certain features of articles of manufacture may vary due to slight variances in dyes used to create cloth for a shirt or the exact position of buttons and logos that are affixed by hand to a garment. Weighting such AIM values less than AIM values that provide a higher degree of certainty reduces the likelihood of a false negative authentication.

Data stored in WAAL is amassed over time progressively improving the probability that calculations performed by WAAL are accurate in determining or disproving the authenticity of an object i.e. to determine accurately whether or not the object is an ART . WAAL is configured to perform token e.g. IT management and provide real time communication with ITRs and PPLs including validation and verification of the authenticity of an object i.e. ART.

In some embodiments WAAL is configured to store attributes of known facsimile or counterfeit goods to improve the ability of WAAL to identify fraudulent or counterfeit goods. For example counterfeit goods may include differences in the physical appearance of the good that are known to a manufacturer or producer of the goods but are not well known by a prospective buyer. In some embodiments these known physical differences are stored in WAAL and used to identify an object as counterfeit.

For example known counterfeit goods may include a tag in a location that is offset from the location in which the same or similar tag of an authentic item is to be located or the known counterfeit good may include differences in a collar or in the number of buttons. The attributes of known counterfeit goods are stored by the WAAL and can be used during an authentication process by analyzing an image collected by an ITR to assess whether the object being authenticated is in fact authentic or counterfeit. In this manner the knowledge base of the WAAL is increased over a period of time as data on known counterfeit goods and authentic goods are collected and stored in WAAL .

ITRs includes devices configured to read interrogate and interpret one or more AIMs which are described in greater detail below using one or more sensors configured to generate electrical signals in response to wave energy. Examples of such wave sensors includes receivers for receiving audio sounds a camera or light sensitive sensor for performing optical measurements and magnetic sensitive sensors to list but only a few possibilities.

In some embodiments ITRs are implemented in a mobile form factor such as for example a fob a smartphone portable music player tablet computer laptop computer personal digital assistant PDA or other portable electronic device with capacity for wireless data communication or at least intermittent coupling into a data network. In some embodiments ITRs are implemented in more stationary devices such as a desktop computer kiosk and or point of sale terminals.

As illustrated in ITR is illustrated as a mobile module configured to communicate with other mobile devices such as mobile unit illustrated in and or other stationary devices such as a computer. ITR module includes a wave reader that is a multi function sensor array configured to sense radio optical magnetic audio and other wave energy.

In some embodiments ITR module includes a display configured to display images and text to a user. In some embodiments display is a touch screen display configured to display virtual icons or keys through which a user may input data. In some embodiments module is a fob without a display but that includes other circuitry and features illustrated in .

A long range and or cellular communication chip LRC or circuitry provides module with the ability to communication via a cellular network and or a WIFI network. A cellular chip enables module to communication with WAAL and or PPLs via a wireless communication protocol such as for example CDMA GSM 3G and 4G LTE to list but only a few possibilities. As described in greater detail below ITR module and more generally ITRs exchange calculated IT data values user profile data reports advertising and or other data with WAALs and or with PPLs via network which may be accessed via the Internet a cellular network and or other network.

In embodiments in which LRC includes a WIFI adapter LRC is configured to be placed into a promiscuous mode such that one or more AIMs can be interrogated. One example of this is that LRC is configured to read the media access control MAC or burned in permanent address of a network card present in another device e.g. a computer . As will be understood by one skilled in the art a MAC address of a network card is a unique non duplicated code set by the manufacturer equivalent in discussion to the fact that all transponding devices produced in accordance to internal agreement of manufacturers are unique.

In some embodiments modules also includes a short range communication chip SRC such as for example a Bluetooth Near Field Communication NFC or other chip that enables module to pair with e.g. communicate data bidirectionally with other devices. Although communication chips and are depicted as separate components one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that chips and may be implemented in a single package. In some embodiments SRC chip can be placed in a promiscuous mode in which SRC chip performs data gathering.

A power supply such as a rechargeable or replaceable battery is configured to provide power to each of the active devices of module . In addition to the active devices described above module also includes one or more processors or CPUs . Processor s is configured to execute an ART Artifact Validation Program AAVP . The AAVP provides the instructions for module to interrogate an object and calculate IT values to assess the authenticity of the object. When executing the AAVP processor s may cause display to display information about the object s in question to a user. Examples of such information includes but is not limited to history status and or location of the object.

Module also includes a memory such as a random access memory RAM and or a read only memory ROM . Memory is a non transitory machine readable storage medium configured to store the instructions for executing the AAVP. Memory is also configured to store data obtained by module from wave reader and communication chips and . One or more keys or other user input device can also be included in module .

In some embodiments module includes means for conveying signals and notifications to a user beyond a display. For example module includes one or more light emitting diode s LED s are configured to emit one or more colors of light based on an authentication response as described in greater detail below. An oscillator is configured to vibrate or generate a tactile notification and a speaker is configured to generate an audible notification to a user. In some embodiments the notifications emitted by one or more of LEDs oscillator and speaker are to notify a user as to whether an object has been authenticated as described in greater detail below.

ITR module can communicate with a mobile device using a wireless wired or other communication channel. As shown in mobile device includes one or more processors in signal communication with a persistent memory and a more volatile memory . In some embodiments memory is configured to store the AAVP and memory is configured to store data acquired by mobile device . A power supply is configured to provide power for mobile device including power to processor s . Power supply can be a replaceable and or rechargeable battery as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

In some embodiments mobile device includes an attachment port such as a universal serial bus USB interface or a secure digital SD card slot for transmitting and receiving data via a wired or otherwise mechanical connection e.g. slot and card .

One or more LED are provided for displaying status signals to a user. In some embodiments LEDs are used to make visible all or part of an ART. The use and control of LEDs or other illuminating device that produces waves in the visible or ultraviolet range can be used to expose AIM or other characteristics of ART.

Mobile device includes one or more sensor devices that comprise a wave reader. For example mobile device includes an ultra high frequency UHF radio frequency identification RFID reader a high frequency RFID reader a microphone and a camera . Although shown as separate devices one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that RFID readers and can be implemented as a single device in some embodiments and are configured to interrogate RFID tags that may be embedded or coupled to objects as described in greater detail below.

Microphone and camera are configured to receive audio signals waves and light signals waves respectively and generate and or output electrical signals in response. Camera can be a digital camera that includes photosensitive electronics such as charge coupled devices CCD or complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS image sensors. The sensor array of camera is covered with a patterned color filter mosaic having red green and blue regions in the Bayer filter arrangement such that each sensor element can record the intensity of a single primary color of light. Camera interpolates the color information of neighboring sensor elements through a process called demosaicing to create a final image.

Camera is configured to receive information across a broad spectrum of visible and invisible wavelengths and to detect small objects e.g. objects on a scale of a few millimeters down to micrometer or microscopic in size . In some embodiments camera is configured to enable device to perform macro examination of larger images and or to support dimensional analysis the collection of pattern information and other visible data to analyze ART. Other physical characteristics like size weight range of movement special movement mass scale and others may be calculated or measured with camera . Camera may also collect a range of observations or observable points to calculate pattern or patterns for use in validation and authentication.

In some embodiments camera is used in connection with LEDs or other illuminating device that produces waves in the visible or ultraviolet range. For example the one or more LEDs are controlled by processor to emit specific wavelength or color combinations to expose patterns specifically sensitive or that become visible to either the device human or other sensor when exposed to the special light range produced by the LEDs the classic invisible ink technique is a metaphoric example whereby the writing on an object is only exposed to a certain wavelength of light shined on it. Then the observer can collect the information and provide it to the AAVP . Camera is used to record the resulting image.

Mobile device also includes one or more units for providing communications with other devices. For example mobile device includes an NFC chip a WIFI or other wireless networking chip a short range e.g. a Bluetooth chip and a cellular chip . Communication chips or units and may be separate units or combined into a single package.

Display can be a touchscreen display configured to display information to a user in the form graphics and text. Examples of such information includes but is not limited to history status and or location of an object being interrogated for authenticity. One or more keys or other user input device can also be included in mobile device such that a user can input data and control device .

In some embodiments mobile device also includes a speaker and an oscillator . LEDs speaker and oscillator are configured to provide notifications to a user. For example LEDs and display may generate a visual notification to a user speaker is configured to generate an audible notification to a user and oscillator is configured to generate a tactile notification to a user.

One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that more stationary devices such as computers kiosks and point of sale or checkout devices or registers to list but only a few possibilities can be configured as an ITR and include some or all of the features described above with respect to module and mobile device .

PPLs can be public or private libraries of ART. For example a company or manufacturer of goods can develop its own library or database of the signatures of the products the company sells or produces. In some embodiments PPLs are implemented in one or more servers that are in signal communication with WAAL and one or more ITRs via network . PPLs store AIMs as embedded codes in digital media software or electronic medium. At some level AIMs are associated to ART in a database residing in PPLs .

As mentioned above ITRs are configured to interrogate objects to determine their authenticity. illustrates one example of a diagram key of ART . ART is used to describe a physical object that is authentic.

In some embodiments one or more AIMs include tamper proof RFID electric or magnetic field sensitive tags. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art such tamper resistant tags include trip mechanisms which are sewn or otherwise permanently or semi permanently affixed to an object. In some embodiments the tamper resistant tags are chemically or electronically linked to the ART.

If the AIM is equipped or designed with a trip mechanism then removal or separation of the AIM beyond a certain distance from the ART causes a detectable change in state of the AIM . Non limiting examples of trip mechanisms include physical or electronic switches a relay or other closed circuit that is fastened to the object. Removal or tampering is detected by the AIM emitting a signal or changing its response to an interrogation signal due to being in the tampered state.

Another example of a trip mechanism of RFID tags is an antenna wire or conductor that once attached to the object can only be removed by breaking or destroying the antenna thus indicating that the AIM has been tampered with an may indicate a suspect piece of ART. The AIM may either cease to function or otherwise change to indicate to the interrogator that it has been tampered with. This AIM connections can be chemical adhesive to the ART or an electronic contact switch that triggers a change to the aim when moved equivalent to a mechanical relay an electronic voltaic or photovoltaic bridge that once broken cannot be reversed or even a chemically stable bond when attached and the AIM changes due to an irreversible chemical reaction when removed from the ART.

One example of a method of authenticating an ART using an ITR is described with reference to . Referring first to method begins at block when the AAVP program is initialized on an ITR . illustrates one example of a home screen of the AAVP displayed to a user of an ITR which takes the form of a tablet or smart phone . In some embodiments the AAVP is executed by a processor of a stationary ITR such as a computer or kiosk. As understood by one of ordinary skill in the art processor executes the AAVP and causes a home screen graphical user interface GUI to be displayed to a user on display . A plurality of virtual icons are presented to a user on display . In some embodiments icons provide a user with various options such as for example perform a check Check access a report Report win items Win review authenticated items My Stuff go to website Website access social network interface Social Networks help Help adjust settings Settings access information or alerts Info Alerts and close the program Close .

If a user selects the Check icon then the AAVP prompts the user to perform one or more data acquisition processes at block . For example and referring to a message is displayed to a user on display requesting the user to perform a first data acquisition process such as scan an RFID tag of a TA .

At block the first data acquisition process is performed. In some embodiments one data acquisition process is performed in response to a user input such as a user contacting a graphical icon that triggers ITR to perform the first data acquisition process. In embodiments in which the first data acquisition process is an RFID scan an RFID reader of ITR emits a trigger signal to interrogate an RFID tag affixed to the ART. In some embodiments the trigger signal is a high frequency signal e.g. 3 30 MHz and or an ultra high frequency signal e.g. 300 MHz 3 GHz. In response to the trigger signal RFID reader s receive a signal from an RFID tag which includes the tag ID TID of the tag. The TID is stored in a memory such that the TID is associated with a data file of the ART being authenticated.

Each data acquisition process is used to create a profile for the object to confirm that the object is ART. As illustrated in display presents a GUI to a user that includes a checklist of possible data acquisition processes that can be formed to collect data for authenticating an object. Examples of such data acquisition processes include but are not limited to taking a photograph of the object taking a photograph of identifying indicia of the object e.g. a logo or trademark a barcode scan and reading an RFID tag to list but only a few possibilities. illustrates the checklist having been updated to include a photograph of the object along with the barcode.

In some embodiments multiple photographs are acquired of various aspects of an object to authenticate an object. For example if the object being authenticated is apparel the objects profile stored by WAAL may include numerous parameters that are to be checked for authenticity. Taking a shirt as an example an authentic version of the shirt may include an RFID tag a hangtag including a barcode that is looped through a particular buttonhole of the shirt a company logo or emblem and a particular type of collar. Consequently a user of the ITR may be prompted to acquire an image of each of these particular features for comparison by the AAVP and WAAL .

In some embodiments multiple RFID or other scans are used to authenticate an item. For example a consumer electronics product or OEM assembly for a government entity e.g. the Department of Defense DOD typically includes multiple OEM components that can each be interrogated. If the electronic device includes a wireless access chip and a Bluetooth chip ITR can pair with the electronic device to acquire the Bluetooth ID and a MAC address of the wireless access chip can be acquired by the ITR . The Bluetooth ID and MAC address of the wireless access chip are used by the AAVP and WAAL for authentication as described in greater detail below.

In some embodiments a combination of scans and photographs are used for authenticating an item. For example a pharmaceutical package may be secured with a tamper proof resistant RFID tag and including a content label comprising a barcode. The content label may include a logo lot number expiration date and or a manufacturer s list of compounds or ingredients. In some embodiments the container which may be a plastic bottle or other suitable pharmaceutical container is also embossed with a lot number.

ITR interrogates the RFID tag using an RFID reader e.g. wave reader or RFID readers and acquires one or more images of the label and pharmaceutical package using camera . In some embodiments the AAVP includes an optical character recognition OCR program for extracting data from the one or more images acquired by camera . For example the lot number expiration date and or list of compounds or ingredients can be recognized from the one or more images acquired by camera of ITR .

Referring again to processor executes AAVP and calculates an IT value for the ART at block based on the AIM values collected during the data acquisition. In some embodiments the IT calculation includes applying weights to data values. For example an image may be weighted less than a weight of an RFID tag or barcode value since a counterfeit object may have a similar if not identical appearance to an authentic object. The Raotronic fingerprint i.e. calculated IT value is calculated based on several factors including but not limited to the number of AIMs types of AIMs accuracy of AIMs number of records and number weighting factors. Increasing the number of factors that are taken into consideration increases the strength of the authentication while preventing false negatives as described above.

The following provides one example of an authentication calculation for a shirt which has a profile identifying a total of 370 possible points with 200 points provided for a match of a TID of an RFID tag a barcode match providing 50 points a color match providing 25 points a size match providing 20 points and a lot and cut match providing 75 points. If data acquisition processes are performed on a shirt such that 300 of the possible 370 points are identified e.g. 200 points for the TID matching 25 points for the color match and 75 points for the lot and cut match then the IT value is 300 or 0.811 percent of a match.

Referring again to the pharmaceutical container example described above the IT calculation is based on the expiration data the RFID tag ID which is weighted five times as much that the expiration data the lot number bar code which is weighted twice as much as the expiration data. The visual e.g. optical comparison of the company logo may be given a weight of twice that of the expiration data. Out of a possible 100 percent match the data acquisition processes may identify a 90 percent of the possible values based on a horizontal confidence. Based on a population of several thousands of bottles in the lot the value is strengthened by five percent to 95 percent. If a manufacturer had been alerted that the lot number had been compromised then the value may be lowered to 85 percent.

At block the IT value calculated by ITR and other data in some embodiments is transmitted to a WAAL and or to a PPL . The calculated IT value can be transmitted to WAAL and or to one or more PPLs via network . In some embodiments the message transmitting the calculated IT value is encrypted prior to transmission.

The process performed by WAAL in response to receiving the message and the calculated IT value from ITR is described with reference to which is a flow diagram of one example of an authentication method performed by WAAL . At block WAAL receives the message including the calculated IT value. In some embodiments the message including the calculated IT value is received directly from ITR via network and in some embodiments WAAL receives the calculated IT value from a PPL which forwards the calculated IT value in the event PPL was not able to confirm the authenticity of the object based on the calculated IT value as described in greater detail below with respect to .

At block the calculated ITR value and other data if applicable is extracted from the message and compared to IT values stored in database . In some embodiments WAAL hashes the ITR value and compares the hash key to a hashing table to determine if the calculated IT value resides in memory. In some embodiments WAAL performs a straight comparison of the calculated value to the stored IT values.

At block WAAL transmits a message to ITR that confirms the authentication of the object as being an ART identifies the object as not being ART requests additional information and or identifies a probability that the item is authentic or counterfeit. In some embodiments the message transmitted directly from WAAL to ITR via network . In some embodiments such as embodiments in which WAAL receives the message from ITR via a PPL WAAL transmits a message destined for ITR to PPL with instructions to forward the message to ITR .

If the calculated IT value received from ITR matches a value stored in database or varies from a value stored within database within a first predetermined error range then WAAL transmits a message identifying that the object interrogated by ITR is ART . If the IT value does not match an IT value in database and is outside the first predetermined range but within a second predetermined range then the message transmitted from WAAL requests ITR provide additional data and or recalculate the IT value before WAAL will authenticate the object as ART . If the calculated IT value received from ITR does not match an IT value in database and is outside of the second predetermined range then the message transmitted from WAAL to ITR identifies the object as not being ART . As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art the greater the number and strength of AIMs and depending on the closeness of the match to the WAAL database the higher the probability is that the object is ART .

Turning now to which is a flow diagram of an authentication method performed by a PPL PPL receives a message including the calculated IT value from ITR via network at block .

At block PPL extracts the calculated IT value from the message and compares the extracted IT value to values stored in a database controlled by and local to PPL . In some embodiments PPL hashes the ITR value received from ITR and compares the hash key to a hashing table to determine if the calculated IT value resides in memory. In some embodiments PPL performs a straight comparison of the calculated IT value received from ITR to stored IT values.

At decision block PPL determines if the calculated IT value received from ITR matches an IT value within the local database or is within a first or second predetermined range of one of the stored IT values.

If the calculated IT value received from ITR does not match and is not within one of the predetermined error ranges then method proceeds to block . At block PPL transmits a message including the calculated IT value received from ITR to WAAL which performs the authentication check method described above with respect to . PPL transmits the message to WAAL such that WAAL can perform a secondary check of the calculated IT value using WAAL s database which is larger than a database retained by PPL .

At block PPL receives message from WAAL . In some embodiments the message received from WAAL includes a copy of an IT value and the associated data of ART if WAAL was able to identify a match or a suitable match within a predetermined error range to the calculated IT value received from ITR . PPL extracts the data included in the message from WAAL and updates its associated database. In some embodiments the message received from WAAL identifies that WAAL was not able to identify an identical or suitable match i.e. a match within a predetermined range .

At block PPL transmits a message to ITR via network . If the calculated IT value received from ITR matched or was a suitable match i.e. is within a first predetermined range of an IT value as determined by PPL or by WAAL then PPL transmits a message to ITR identifying that the interrogated object is an ART . If the calculated IT value received from ITR does not match an IT value and is not within the first predetermined range but is within a second predetermined range as determined by PPL or WAAL then PPL transmits a message to ITR requesting additional data and or requesting ITR to recalculate the IT value. If the calculated IT value received from ITR does not match an IT value and is outside of the second predetermined range as determined by PPL or WAAL then the message transmitted from PPL to ITR identifies the object as not being ART .

Referring again to ITR receives a message from WAAL or PPL and determines if additional data acquisition is needed at decision block . ITR determines if additional data acquisitions processes should be performed based on the message received from WAAL or PPL . If additional data acquisition is needed then ITR proceeds to block where a user is prompted to performed one or more data acquisition processes. As described above additional data acquisition may be needed if WAAL and or PPL cannot definitively determine if the calculated IT value corresponds to a stored IT value. For example if the calculated value does not exactly or suitably match a stored IT value but is with the second predetermined range of values then additional data acquisition processes should be performed.

A notification that additional data acquisition is required to authenticate the object can be provided to the user. For example display can generate a message requesting additional data acquisition. In some embodiments LEDs can generate a predetermined color e.g. a yellow light which indicates that additional data acquisition is needed before the object can be authenticated. Speaker and or oscillator can also generate notifications to a user. For example speaker may emit multiple beeps or tones or play a message requesting additional data acquisition steps be performed. Oscillator may provide a series of short or long pulses which indicates that additional data steps are needed before the object can be authenticated as ART TA. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the notifications are not exclusive of one another and each can be simultaneously generated. In some embodiments the AAVP enables a user to customize the types of notifications he her would like to receive e.g. audible tactile and or visual.

If additional data acquisition is not needed then ITR moves to decision block to determine if the interrogated object is ART . In some embodiments the decision at block is based on the message received from WAAL or PPL . If the object is determined to be ART then ITR moves to block and generates one or more notifications to a user on display identifying that the object is ART. For example display can generate a message identifying the object as ART TA. In some embodiments LED s emit a light such as a green light signifying that the object is ART TA. Speaker can emit a sound indicating the object is ART TA and or oscillator can generate a series of pulses signifying that the object is authentic.

If the object is determined to not be ART then ITR moves to block and generates one or more notifications to a user on display identifying that the object is not ART. Visual audible and or tactile notifications can be generated by one or more of LED s display speaker and or oscillator . For example LED s can be configured to generate a red light and display can be configured to generate a message conveying that the object is not authentic. Speaker can be configured to emit a noise or message and oscillator can be configured to provide one or more pulses that identify the object as not being authentic.

WAAL can also be used to authenticate goods purchased via an online retailer or reseller. One example of such an authentication method is described with reference to which are flow diagrams of one example of such a method. Referring first to an online marketer such as a distributor or auction house receives a request from a purchaser for the marketed object to be authenticated at block .

At block online marketer transmits a message to the seller requesting the AIM values or other authentication credentials. The message transmitted to seller can request various AIMs including but not limited the serial number and product number which may be obtained from one or more barcodes the location from which the object was procured where the object currently resides the NFC data if the object includes an NFC tag and one or more multi dimension photos or videos of the object to provide only a few non limiting examples.

At block online marketer receives one or more AIMs from the seller in response to the transmitted request. In some embodiments online marketer calculates an IT value for the object based on the AIMs received from seller. In some embodiments online marketer stores the AIM values received from seller without calculating an IT value.

At block online marketer transmits an authentication request to WAAL or to PPL . In some embodiments the authentication request message transmitted to WAAL includes an IT value calculated by online retailer and in some embodiments the authentication request message transmitted to WAAL includes the AIM values received from the seller.

Referring now to which is a flow diagram of one example of an authentication method performed by WAAL WAAL receives the authentication request message at block . In some embodiments the authentication request message received from online marketer is received via network in accordance with the API of WAAL .

At decision block WAAL parses the received message and determines if the message includes a calculated IT value. If the message does not include an IT value then method moves to block where WAAL calculates an IT value from the AIM values provided in the message received from online retailer .

At block with an IT value having been calculated either by online retailer or by WAAL WAAL compares the calculated IT value to IT values stored in database . In some embodiments the comparison at block includes hashing the calculated IT value and comparing the hash key to a hash table stored in database . In some embodiments WAAL performs a straight comparison of the calculated IT value to the stored IT values.

At block WAAL transmits a message to online retailer that confirms the authentication of the object as an ART identifies the object as not being ART or requests additional information. For example if the calculated IT value matches a value stored in database or is within a suitable range of values stored as an authenticity defining criterion i.e. is within a first predetermined range then WAAL transmits a message identifying that the object is ART . If the calculated IT value does not match an IT value in database and is outside the first predetermined range but within a second predetermined range then the message transmitted from WAAL to online retailer requests additional data. If the calculated IT value does not match an IT value in database and is outside of the second predetermined range then the message transmitted from WAAL to online retailer identifies the object as not being ART .

Turning back to online retailer receives the authentication message from WAAL at block . As described above the authentication message received from WAAL includes a determination of whether the object is ART the object is not ART or additional information is needed by WAAL before WAAL can authenticate the object.

At decision block online retailer determines whether additional information is needed before the object can be authenticated. If the message received from WAAL identifies that additional information is needed i.e. the calculated IT value was outside of the first predetermined range but within the second predetermined range then method moves to block and requests the seller to provide additional information about the object.

If the message received from WAAL identifies that additional information is not needed i.e. the calculated IT value was within the first predetermined range or outside the second predetermined range then method moves to decision block to determine if the object has been authenticated i.e. if the object is ART .

If the message received from WAAL identifies the object as being ART then online retailer transmits a message to the prospective buyer at block that notifies the buyer that the object cannot be authenticated and is ART. In some embodiments the message transmitted to the prospective buyer at block includes a certificate of authentication that includes embedded links to a website or portal maintained by WAAL that enables the prospective buyer to access the profile of the object that has been identified as ART . The ART profile can include AIM data including but not limited to the name of the vendor date of certification certification product details and a description of the product.

If the message received from WAAL identifies the object as not being ART then online retailer transmits a message to the prospective buyer at block that notifies the buyer that the object can be authenticated but that it is not ART.

The systems and methods described above can also be used to assess risk for large assemblies in which authentication is critical such as assemblies for national defense e.g. cars trucks drones fighter planes self guided munitions etc. . For example and referring to the AAVP can be configured to present graphics to a user on a display that identifies the likelihood of authentication and the associated risk. The amount of risk associated with a certain authenticity percentage may be configured by a particular entity e.g. government defense contractor etc.

The AAVP generates the graphics illustrated in after performing numerous data acquisition processes on one or more components of the assembly. Interrogating the components in a supply chain or a finished assembly provides an increased assurance that the goods are authentic and have not been tampered.

The systems and methods described above advantageously enable objects to be identified using various data. The WAAL a central repository of authentication information is able to be accessed via networks such that individual users and organizations can access the database. By providing data that can be used for authentication brand name owners and manufacturers can track goods through supply chains as well as ensure that the ultimate purchasers are receiving authentic goods.

The present invention can be embodied in the form of methods and apparatus for practicing those methods. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code embodied in tangible media such as secure digital SD cards USB flash drives diskettes CD ROMs DVD ROMs Blu ray disks hard drives or any other non transitory machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code for example whether stored in a storage medium loaded into and or executed by a machine or transmitted over some transmission medium such as over electrical wiring or cabling through fiber optics or via electromagnetic radiation wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general purpose processor the program code segments combine with the processor to provide a unique device that operates analogously to specific logic circuits.

Although the invention has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments it is not limited thereto. Rather the appended claims should be construed broadly to include other variants and embodiments of the invention which may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and range of equivalents of the invention.
