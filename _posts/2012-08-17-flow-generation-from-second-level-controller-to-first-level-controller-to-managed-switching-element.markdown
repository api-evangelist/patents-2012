U.S. Applications 61 524 755 61 524 756 61 671 664 and 61 675 807 are incorporated herein by reference.

Many current enterprises have large and sophisticated networks comprising switches hubs routers servers workstations and other networked devices which support a variety of connections applications and systems. The increased sophistication of computer networking including virtual machine migration dynamic workloads multi tenancy and customer specific quality of service and security configurations require a better paradigm for network control. Networks have traditionally been managed through low level configuration of individual components. Network configurations often depend on the underlying network for example blocking a user s access with an access control list ACL entry requires knowing the user s current IP address. More complicated tasks require more extensive network knowledge forcing guest users port 80 traffic to traverse an HTTP proxy requires knowing the current network topology and the location of each guest. This process is of increased difficulty where the network switching elements are shared across multiple users.

In response there is a growing movement towards a new network control paradigm called Software Defined Networking SDN . In the SDN paradigm a network controller running on one or more servers in a network controls maintains and implements control logic that governs the forwarding behavior of shared network switching elements on a per user basis. Making network management decisions often requires knowledge of the network state. To facilitate management decision making the network controller creates and maintains a view of the network state and provides an application programming interface upon which management applications may access a view of the network state.

Some of the primary goals of maintaining large networks including both datacenters and enterprise networks are scalability mobility and multi tenancy. Many approaches taken to address one of these goals results in hampering at least one of the others. For instance one can easily provide network mobility for virtual machines within an L2 domain but L2 domains cannot scale to large sizes. Furthermore retaining tenant isolation greatly complicates mobility. As such improved solutions that can satisfy the scalability mobility and multi tenancy goals are needed.

Some embodiments of the invention provide different mechanisms for connecting two or more networks together in order to achieve communication between machines e.g. virtual machines or physical machines located within the different networks. In some embodiments the networks connected together are located at different sites e.g. different data centers each of which consists of several end machines. Some embodiments utilize interconnection switching elements located at the edges of the different networks that are specifically programmed to enable packets from a source network to be read by a destination network. In some embodiments the connection of the networks forms a larger logical network that includes the individual site networks.

In some embodiments the individual networks logically connected together are themselves logical networks. Each logical network is managed by a network control system that enables the specification of a logical datapath set for the logical network. The network control system configures a set of shared switching elements to implement the specified logical datapath set thereby virtualizing the switching elements. In order to interconnect multiple logical networks some embodiments provide a hierarchical control system that includes a hierarchical arrangement of network controllers. A set of higher level network controllers receives a specification of a higher level logical datapath set that includes the machines of all of the lower level logical networks. The higher level network controllers generate flow entries that are passed down to the lower level network controllers. These lower level network controllers configure the shared switching elements within their respective networks in order to implement the higher level logical datapath set on top of their own respective lower level logical datapath sets. In this case the higher level logical datapath set serves to interconnect the lower level logical datapath sets thereby interconnecting the networks.

The hierarchical controller arrangement in turn results in hierarchical processing of packets by the switching elements within the network. As stated the higher level network controllers generate flow tables that implement the highest level logical datapath set that governs packet forwarding between end machines of the network then pass these tables down to the lower level network controllers. The lower level network controllers then incorporate the received higher level flow entries into their own flow tables that implement the lower level logical datapath sets. Each set of lowest level network controllers generates flow tables for the physical managed switching elements within the network of the controller set and passes these generated flow tables to the physical switching elements. These flow tables specify lookup entries that the managed switching elements use to process packets within the logical network. When a managed switching element receives a packet on a physical port the managed switching element maps the packet to logical ports of the hierarchical data paths makes a forwarding decision to an egress port at the highest level and maps the identified egress port back down through the hierarchy of data paths to a physical egress port.

In some embodiments the networks logically connected together may include unmanaged segmented networks. In some cases a network manager will want to provide connections between a first network segmented using a first tagging or tunneling technique e.g. VLAN Mac in Mac L2 over L3 MPLS etc. and a second network segmented using a second tagging or tunneling technique. Even when the two networks use the same technique e.g. both networks using VLANs the implementation of that technique e.g. the structure of the tags used in packet headers may be different between the two networks such that they are effectively using two different techniques. Some embodiments provide a mechanism for connecting such differently segmented networks across a common interconnecting network e.g. an L3 network that can forward traffic between the different networks.

To connect such networks some embodiments use a single managed interconnection switching element or cluster thereof at the edge of each of the segmented networks then manage these interconnection switching elements with a network controller that defines a logical datapath set between the sites. The network controller generates flow tables that implement the logical datapath set and passes these flow tables to the set of physical interconnection switching elements the forwarding tables of which implement the various levels of logical flow. Rather than corresponding to individual end machines of the network segments the ports of the logical switching element instead correspond to the network segments themselves e.g. a particular VLAN corresponding to a particular port .

The managed interconnection switching elements are programmed to be able to remove and add the local context tags e.g. VLAN tags of their local site network. Therefore these switching elements have the ability to receive a local packet strip the packet of its local context and use the logical switching element implementation to add a context for the interconnecting network that identifies the interconnection switching element local to the destination site network for the packet.

The preceding Summary is intended to serve as a brief introduction to some embodiments of the invention. It is not meant to be an introduction or overview of all inventive subject matter disclosed in this document. The Detailed Description that follows and the Drawings that are referred to in the Detailed Description will further describe the embodiments described in the Summary as well as other embodiments. Accordingly to understand all the embodiments described by this document a full review of the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawings is needed. Moreover the claimed subject matters are not to be limited by the illustrative details in the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawing but rather are to be defined by the appended claims because the claimed subject matters can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the subject matters.

In the following detailed description of the invention numerous details examples and embodiments of the invention are set forth and described. However it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a network control system that allows several different logical datapath sets to be specified for several different users through one or more shared forwarding elements without allowing the different users to control or even view each other s forwarding logic. The shared forwarding elements in some embodiments can include virtual or physical network switches software switches e.g. Open vSwitch routers and or other switching devices as well as any other network elements such as load balancers etc. that establish connections between these switches routers and or other switching devices. Such forwarding elements e.g. physical switches or routers are also referred to below as switching elements. In contrast to an off the shelf switch a software forwarding element is a switching element that in some embodiments is formed by storing its switching table s and logic in the memory of a standalone device e.g. a standalone computer or a device e.g. a computer that also executes a hypervisor and one or more virtual machines on top of that hypervisor.

More specifically the network control system of some embodiments manages networks over which machines e.g. virtual machines belonging to several different users i.e. several different users in a private or public hosted environment with multiple hosted computers and managed forwarding elements that are shared by multiple different related or unrelated tenants may exchange data packets for separate logical datapath sets. That is machines belonging to a particular user may exchange data with other machines belonging to the same user over a logical datapath set for that user while machines belonging to a different user exchange data with each other over a different logical datapath set implemented on the same physical managed network. In some embodiments a logical datapath set also referred to as a logical forwarding element logical switching element e.g. logical switch logical router or logical network in some cases is a logical construct that provides switching fabric to interconnect several logical ports to which a particular user s machines physical or virtual may attach.

These managed shared switching elements are referred to below as managed switching elements or managed forwarding elements as they are managed by the network control system in order to implement the logical datapath sets. In some embodiments described below the control system manages these switching elements by pushing physical control plane data to them as further described below. Switching elements generally receive data e.g. a data packet and perform one or more processing operations on the data such as dropping a received data packet passing a packet that is received from one source device to another destination device processing the packet and then passing it to a destination device etc. In some embodiments the physical control plane data that is pushed to a switching element is converted by the switching element e.g. by a general purpose processor of the switching element to physical forwarding plane data that specify how the switching element e.g. how a specialized switching circuit of the switching element processes data packets that it receives.

In some embodiments the network control system includes one or more network controllers also called controller instances below that allow the system to accept logical datapath sets from users and to configure the switching elements to implement these logical datapath sets. These controllers allow the system to virtualize control of the shared switching elements and the logical networks that are defined by the connections between these shared switching elements in a manner that prevents the different users from viewing or controlling each other s logical datapath sets and logical networks while sharing the same switching elements.

In some embodiments each controller instance is a device e.g. a general purpose computer that executes one or more modules that transform the user input from a logical control plane to a logical forwarding plane and then transform the logical forwarding plane data to physical control plane data. These modules in some embodiments include a control module and a virtualization module. A control module allows a user to specify and populate logical datapath sets while a virtualization module implements the specified logical datapath sets by mapping the logical datapath sets onto the physical switching infrastructure. In some embodiments the control and virtualization modules are two separate applications while in other embodiments they are part of the same application.

In some embodiments described below the virtualization module converts logical forwarding plane data directly to physical control plane data that is pushed to the managed switches. While some embodiments perform this conversion directly from the logical forwarding plane to the physical control plane providing data that is customized specifically for each managed switching element other embodiments improve the scalability of the system by introducing an intermediate universal forwarding state that provides data at the physical control plane level that is not customized to any particular managed switching element.

In such embodiments from the logical forwarding plane data for a particular logical datapath set the virtualization module of some embodiments generates universal physical control plane UPCP data that is generic for any managed switching element that implements the logical datapath set. In some embodiments this virtualization module is part of a controller instance that is a master controller for the particular logical datapath set. This controller is referred to as the logical controller.

In some embodiments the UPCP data is then converted to customized physical control plane CPCP data for each particular managed switching element by a controller instance that is a master physical controller instance for the particular managed switching element or by a chassis controller for the particular managed switching element as further described in concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 589 077 entitled Chassis Controller and now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9 178 833. When the chassis controller generates the CPCP data the chassis controller obtains the UPCP data from the virtualization module of the logical controller through the physical controller.

Irrespective of whether the physical controller or chassis controller generates the CPCP data the CPCP data for a particular managed switching element needs to be propagated to the managed switching element. In some embodiments the CPCP data is propagated through a network information base NIB data structure which in some embodiments is an object oriented data structure. Several examples of using the NIB data structure are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 177 529 and 13 177 533 which are incorporated herein by reference. As described in these applications the NIB data structure is also used in some embodiments to may serve as a communication medium between different controller instances and to store data regarding the logical datapath sets e.g. logical switching elements and or the managed switching elements that implement these logical datapath sets.

However other embodiments do not use the NIB data structure to propagate CPCP data from the physical controllers or chassis controllers to the managed switching elements to communicate between controller instances and to store data regarding the logical datapath sets and or managed switching elements. For instance in some embodiments the physical controllers and or chassis controllers communicate with the managed switching elements through OpenFlow entries and updates over the configuration protocol. Also in some embodiments the controller instances use one or more direct communication channels e.g. RPC calls to exchange data. In addition in some embodiments the controller instances e.g. the control and virtualization modules of these instance express the logical and or physical data in terms of records that are written into the relational database data structure. In some embodiments this relational database data structure is part of the input and output tables of a table mapping engine called n Log that is used to implement one or more modules of the controller instances.

Several embodiments described below provide network control systems that completely separate the logical forwarding space i.e. the logical control and forwarding planes from the physical forwarding space i.e. the physical control and forwarding planes . These control systems achieve such separation by using a mapping engine to map the logical forwarding space data to the physical forwarding space data. By completely decoupling the logical space from the physical space the control systems of such embodiments allow the logical view of the logical forwarding elements to remain unchanged while changes are made to the physical forwarding space e.g. virtual machines are migrated physical switches or routers are added etc. .

In some embodiments the network control system manages more than a single network. The network control system of some embodiments provides different mechanisms for connecting two or more networks together in order to achieve communication between machines e.g. virtual machines or physical machines located within the different networks. In some embodiments the networks connected together are located at different sites e.g. different data centers each of which consists of several end machines. Some embodiments utilize interconnection switching elements located at the edges of the different networks that are specifically programmed to enable packets from a source network to be read by a destination network. In some embodiments the connection of the networks forms a larger logical network that includes the individual site networks.

In some embodiments the individual networks logically connected together are themselves logical networks. Each logical network is managed by a network control system that enables the specification of a logical datapath set for the logical network. The network control system configures a set of shared switching elements to implement the specified logical datapath set thereby virtualizing the switching elements. In order to interconnect multiple logical networks some embodiments provide a hierarchical control system that includes a hierarchical arrangement of network controllers. A set of higher level network controllers receives a specification of a higher level logical datapath set that includes the machines of all of the lower level logical networks. The higher level network controllers generate flow entries that are passed down to the lower level network controllers. These lower level network controllers configure the shared switching elements within their respective networks in order to implement the higher level logical datapath set on top of their own respective lower level logical datapath sets. In this case the higher level logical datapath set serves to interconnect the lower level logical datapath sets thereby interconnecting the networks.

The hierarchical controller arrangement in turn results in hierarchical processing of packets by the switching elements within the network. As stated the higher level network controllers generate flow tables that implement the highest level logical datapath set that governs packet forwarding between end machines of the network then pass these tables down to the lower level network controllers. The lower level network controllers then incorporate the received higher level flow entries into their own flow tables that implement the lower level logical datapath sets. Each set of lowest level network controllers generates flow tables for the physical managed switching elements within the network of the controller set and passes these generated flow tables to the physical switching elements. These flow tables specify lookup entries that the managed switching elements use to process packets within the logical network. When a managed switching element receives a packet on a physical port the managed switching element maps the packet to logical ports of the hierarchical data paths makes a forwarding decision to an egress port at the highest level and maps the identified egress port back down through the hierarchy of data paths to a physical egress port.

Additionally the first data center includes a first level network controller while the second data center includes a different first level network controller . The first level network controller generates a first level logical switching element that connects the four machines located within data center while the first level network controller generates a first level logical switching element that connects the four machines located within the data center . These logical switching elements are conceptually illustrated in described below.

In addition to the network controllers shown within the data centers and the network includes a second level network controller . The network controller generates a second level logical switching element that connects together the logical switching elements generated by the first level network controllers and . In this way a single point of control can be used to managed the entire network while the networks in each of the separate data centers and can operate on their own should their connection to each other or the second level network controller be disrupted.

As mentioned conceptually illustrates the logical switching elements generated by the three network controllers in and implemented by the managed switching elements. A first logical switching element for the first data center has five logical ports four of which connect to the machines in the data center. The fifth logical port connects to the remote machines at the second data center logically connecting to a port on the logical switching element . The second logical switching element for the second data center is similarly arranged with four ports connecting to machines at the local data center and a fifth port connecting to the remote machines at the first data center logically connecting to a port on the logical switching element . The second level logical switching element includes eight ports for logically connecting to the eight machines through the logical ports at the first level logical switching elements .

When a machine in the first data center sends a packet to a machine in the second data center these logical switching elements are implemented by the physical switching elements of the network in order to transport the packet. The first managed switching element that receives the packet initially performs ingress context mapping operations to identify the ingress port on the logical switching element that corresponds to the physical ingress port from which the packet is received. The switching element then maps this identified first level logical ingress port to a second level logical ingress port of the second level logical switching element . The flow tables in the managed switching element implementing the second level logical switching element use the packet destination information to make a forwarding decision to a second level egress port which is then mapped to a logical egress port in the logical switching element that corresponds to the destination machine. The generation and operation of these logical switching elements will be described in detail in the sections below.

The above description relates to the situation in which the networks logically connected together are all managed networks governed by logical controllers that implement logical switching elements within the managed switching elements of the networks and use those same managed switching elements to implement the interconnection between the networks. In some embodiments the networks logically connected together may include unmanaged segmented networks. In some cases a network manager will want to provide connections between a first network segmented using a first tagging or tunneling technique e.g. VLAN Mac in Mac L2 over L3 MPLS etc. and a second network segmented using a second tagging or tunneling technique. Even when the two networks use the same technique e.g. both networks using VLANs the implementation of that technique e.g. the structure of the tags used in packet headers may be different between the two networks such that they are effectively using two different techniques. Some embodiments provide a mechanism for connecting such differently segmented networks across a common interconnecting network e.g. an L3 network that can forward traffic between the different networks.

To connect such networks some embodiments use a single managed interconnection switching element e.g. an extender or cluster thereof at the edge of each of the segmented networks then manage these interconnection switching elements with a network controller that defines a logical datapath set between the sites. The network controller generates flow tables that implement the logical datapath set and passes these flow tables to the set of physical interconnection switching elements the forwarding tables of which implement the various levels of logical flow. Rather than corresponding to individual end machines of the network segments the ports of the logical switching element instead correspond to the network segments themselves e.g. a particular VLAN corresponding to a particular port .

The managed interconnection switching elements are programmed to be able to remove and add the local context tags e.g. VLAN tags of their local site network. Therefore these switching elements have the ability to receive a local packet strip the packet of its local context and use the logical switching element implementation to add a context for the interconnecting network that identifies the interconnection switching element local to the destination site network for the packet.

In this situation however interconnection switching elements are located at the edge of each site network connecting the site networks to an interconnecting physical network . This interconnecting physical network acts as a common substrate for the four site networks i.e. all four site networks attach to the network . As shown a network controller connects to each of the four interconnection switching elements . The network controller which may be a controller cluster or a single controller instance generates flow tables for implementing a logical switching element that connects the four site networks then passes the flow tables to the four interconnection switching elements .

The above illustrates a managed network between the sites that has a single network controller at a single level. In addition some embodiments enable the site networks to be grouped via a hierarchical structure such as that described above for . That is several site networks are interconnected with a first lower level network controller while several additional site networks are interconnected with a second lower level network controller. These two groups of site networks can then be themselves interconnected with a higher level network controller that communicates with the lower level network controller.

The following section will describe the environment in which some embodiments of the inventions are implemented. In the present application switching elements and machines may be referred to as network elements switches or other terms. In addition a network managed by one or more network controllers may be referred to as a managed network in the present application. In some embodiments the managed network includes only managed switching elements e.g. switching elements that are controlled by one or more network controllers while in other embodiments the managed network includes managed switching elements as well as unmanaged switching elements e.g. switching elements that are not controlled by a network controller .

In some embodiments the managed switching elements route i.e. process and or forward network data e.g. packets between network elements in the network that are coupled to the managed switching elements . For instance the managed switching element routes network data between the machines and the managed switching element . Similarly the managed switching element routes network data between the machine and the managed switching elements and and the managed switching element routes network data between the machines and the managed switching element .

The managed switching elements of some embodiments can be configured to route network data according to defined rules. In some embodiments the managed switching elements route network data based on routing criteria defined in the rules. Examples of routing criteria include source media access control MAC address destination MAC address packet type source Internet Protocol IP address destination IP address source port destination port and or network segment identifier e.g. virtual local area network VLAN identifier multi protocol label switching MPLS label etc. among other routing criteria.

In some embodiments the managed switching elements can include standalone physical switching elements software switching elements that operate within a computer or any other type of switching element. For example each of the managed switching elements may be implemented as a hardware switching element a software switching element a virtual switching element a network interface controller NIC or any other type of network element that can route network data. Moreover the software or virtual switching elements may operate on a dedicated computer or on a computer that also performs non switching operations.

The machines send and receive network data between each other over the network and in some cases with other machines outside the network . In some embodiments the machines are referred to as network hosts that are each assigned a network layer host address e.g. IP address . In some cases the machines are referred to as end systems because the machines are located at the edge of the network. In some embodiments each of the machines can be a desktop computer a laptop computer a smartphone a virtual machine VM running on a computing device a terminal or any other type of network host.

In some embodiments each of the network controllers and controls one or more managed switching elements that are located at the edge of a network e.g. edge switching elements or edge devices . In this example the managed switching elements are edge switching elements. That is the managed switching elements are switching elements that are located at or near the edge of the network. In some embodiments an edge switching element is the last switching element before one or more end machines the machines in this example in a network. That is an edge switching element is the first switching element that receives network data sent from one or more end machines and is the last switching element that receives network data sent to the one or more end machines. As indicated by dashed arrows in the network controller controls i.e. manages switching elements and and the network controller controls switching element . In this application a switching element that is controlled by a network controller of some embodiments may be referred to as a managed switching element.

In addition to controlling edge switching elements the network controllers and of some embodiments also utilize and control non edge switching elements e.g. pool nodes and extenders which are described in further detail below that are inserted in the network to simplify and or facilitate the operation of the managed edge switching elements. For instance in some embodiments the network controllers and require that the managed switching elements be interconnected in a hierarchical switching architecture that has several edge switching elements as the leaf nodes in the hierarchical switching architecture and one or more non edge switching elements as the non leaf nodes in this architecture. In some such embodiments each edge switching element connects to one or more of the non leaf switching elements and uses such non leaf switching elements to facilitate the communication of the edge switching element with other edge switching elements. Examples of such communications with an edge switching elements in some embodiments include 1 routing of a packet with an unknown destination address e.g. unknown MAC address to the non leaf switching element so that the non leaf switching element can route the packet to the appropriate edge switching element 2 routing a multicast or broadcast packet to the non leaf switching element so that the non leaf switching element can distribute the multicast or broadcast packet to the desired destinations and 3 routing packets to destination machines external to the network .

Some embodiments employ one level of non leaf non edge switching elements that connect to edge switching elements and in some cases to other non leaf switching elements. Other embodiments on the other hand employ multiple levels of non leaf switching elements with each level of non leaf switching elements after the first level serving as a mechanism to facilitate communication between lower level non leaf switching elements and leaf switching elements. In some embodiments the non leaf switching elements are software switching elements that are implemented by storing forwarding tables in the memory of a standalone computer instead of an off the shelf switch. In some embodiments the standalone computer may also be executing a hypervisor and one or more virtual machines on top of that hypervisor. Irrespective of the manner by which the leaf and non leaf switching elements are implemented the network controllers and of some embodiments store switching state information regarding the leaf and non leaf switching elements.

As mentioned above the switching elements of some embodiments route network data between network elements in the network. In some embodiments the network controllers and configure the routing of network data between the network elements in the network by the managed switching elements . In this manner the network controllers and can control the flow i.e. specify the data path of network data between network elements.

For example the network controller might instruct the managed switching elements and to route network data from the machine to the machine and vice versa and to not route e.g. drop network data from other machines to the machines and . In such case the network controller controls the flow of network data through the managed switching elements and such that network data transmitted to and from the machine is only routed to the machine . Thus the machines and cannot send and receive network data to and from the machines and .

In some embodiments the network controllers and store physical network information and logical network information. The physical network information specifies the physical components in the managed network and how the physical components are physically connected one another in the managed network. For example the physical network information may include the number of machines managed switching elements pool nodes and extenders the latter two are described in further detail in the following sections and how the components are physically connected to one another in the managed network. The logical network information may specify the logical connections between a set of physical components in the managed network e.g. machines and a mapping of the logical connections across the physical components of the managed network.

Some embodiments of the network controllers and implement a logical switching element across the managed switching elements based on the physical network information and the logical switching element information described above. A logical switching element can be defined to function any number of different ways that a switching element might function. The network controllers and implement the defined logical switching element through control of the managed switching elements . In some embodiments the network controllers and implement multiple logical switching elements across the managed switching elements . This allows multiple different logical switching elements to be implemented across the managed switching elements without regard to the network topology of the network.

In some embodiments a logical datapath set LDPS defines a logical switching element. A logical datapath set in some embodiments is a set of network data paths through the managed switching elements that implement the logical switching element and the logical switch s defined functionalities. In these embodiments the network controllers and translate e.g. map the defined logical datapath set into network configuration information for implementing the logical switching element. The network controllers and translate the defined logical datapath set into a corresponding set of data flows i.e. data paths between network elements in the network in some embodiments. In these instances the network controllers and instruct the managed switching elements to route network data according to the data flows and thus implement the functionalities of the defined logical switching element. Within this application logical datapath set logical switch logical switching element and logical datapath may be used interchangeably.

Different embodiments of the network controllers and are implemented differently. For example some embodiments implement the network controllers and in software as instances of a software application. In these cases the network controllers and may be executed on different types of computing devices such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a smartphone etc. In addition the software application may be executed on a virtual machine that runs on a computing device in some embodiments. In some embodiments the network controllers and are implemented in hardware e.g. circuits . In some embodiments the network controllers and communicate with each other in order to distribute information. In fact in some embodiments the network controllers that govern a logical network act as a controller cluster that behaves as a single network controller distributed across multiple machines.

As mentioned above by reference to the managed switching elements controlled by network controllers of some embodiments may be physical switching elements. illustrates an example of a network control system that includes physical switching elements. This figure conceptually illustrates a network control system of some embodiments for managing physical switching elements. Specifically the network control system manages network data in a data center that includes top of the rack TOR switching elements and racks of hosts . Network controllers and manage the network by controlling the TOR switching elements .

A TOR switching element in some embodiments routes network data between hosts in the TOR switch s rack and network elements coupled to the TOR switching element. In the example illustrated in the TOR switching element routes network data between the rack of hosts and TOR switching elements and the TOR switching element routes network data between the rack of hosts and TOR switching elements and and the TOR switching element routes network data between the rack of hosts and TOR switching elements and .

As shown each rack of hosts includes multiple hosts. The hosts of some embodiments in the racks of hosts are physical computing devices. In some embodiments each host is a computing device that is assigned a network layer host address e.g. IP address . The hosts of some embodiments send and receive network data to and from each other over the network.

As mentioned above the network controller of some embodiments can be implemented in software as an instance of an application. As illustrated in the network controllers and are instances of a software application. As shown each of the network controllers and includes several software layers a control application layer a virtualization application layer and a networking operating system layer.

In some embodiments the control application layer receives input e.g. from a user that specifies a network switching element. The control application layer may receive the input in any number of different interfaces such as a graphical user interface GUI a command line interfaces a web based interface a touchscreen interface through an application programming interface API exposed to other network controller instances etc. In some embodiments the input specifies characteristics and behaviors of the network switching element such as the number of switching element ports access control lists ACLs network data forwarding port security or any other network switching element configuration options.

The control application layer of some embodiments defines a logical datapath set based on user input that specifies a network switching element. As noted above a logical datapath set is a set of network data paths through managed switching elements that are used to implement the user specified network switching element. In other words the logical datapath set is a logical representation of the network switching element and the network switch s specified characteristics and behaviors.

Some embodiments of the virtualization application layer translate the defined logical datapath set into network configuration information for implementing the logical network switching element across the managed switching elements in the network. For example the virtualization application layer of some embodiments translates the defined logical datapath set into a corresponding set of data flows. In some of these cases the virtualization application layer may take into account various factors e.g. logical switching elements that are currently implemented across the managed switching elements the current network topology of the network etc. in determining the corresponding set of data flows.

The network operating system layer of some embodiments configures the managed switching elements routing of network data. In some embodiments the network operating system instructs the managed switching elements to route network data according to the set of data flows determined by the virtualization application layer.

In some embodiments the network operating system layer maintains several views of the network based on the current network topology. One view that the network operating system layer of some embodiments maintains is a logical view. The logical view of the network includes the different logical switching elements that are implemented across the managed switching elements in some embodiments. Some embodiments of the network operating system layer maintain a managed view of the network. Such managed views include the different managed switching elements in the network i.e. the switching elements in the network that the network controllers control . In some embodiments the network operating system layer also maintains relationship data that relate the logical switching elements implemented across the managed switching elements to the managed switching elements.

The network controller of some embodiments is described in greater detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 177 533 filed on Jul. 6 2011 and entitled Network Virtualization Apparatus and Method which is incorporated herein by reference. As explained in further detail in this application the control application of some embodiments performs a table mapping operation e.g. using an n Log table mapping engine to transform tables in a logical control plane to tables in a logical forwarding plane. The logical control plane in some embodiments includes a collection of constructs that allow the control application and its users to specify one or more logical datapath sets within the logical control plane. The logical forwarding plane in some embodiments includes one or more data path sets of one or more users. Thus the control application transforms the collection of constructs e.g. as specified by a user into the logical datapath sets. The virtualization application transforms logical forwarding plane data into physical control plane data e.g. also using an n Log table mapping engine that can be pushed down to the physical managed switching elements.

While and other figures in this application may show a set of managed switching elements managed by a network controller some embodiments provide several network controllers also referred to as a cluster of network controllers or a control cluster for managing the set of managed switching elements. In other embodiments different control clusters may manage different sets of managed switching elements. Employing a cluster of network controllers in such embodiments to manage a set of managed switching elements increases the scalability of the managed network and increases the redundancy and reliability of the managed network. In some embodiments the network controllers in a control cluster share e.g. through the network operating system layer of the network controllers data related to the state of the managed network in order to synchronize the network controllers.

The TOR switching elements are similar to the TOR switching elements . The TOR switching elements route network data between network elements in the network that are coupled to the TOR switching elements . In this example the TOR switching element routes network data between the rack of hosts and TOR switching elements and the TOR switching element routes network data between the rack of hosts and TOR switching elements and and the TOR switching element routes network data between the rack of hosts and TOR switching elements and . Since the TOR switching elements are not managed switching elements the network controllers and do not control these switching elements. Thus the TOR switching elements rely on the switching elements preconfigured functionalities to route network data.

As illustrated in each host in the racks of hosts includes a software switching element an open virtual switch OVS in this example and several VMs. The VMs are virtual machines that are each assigned a set of network layer host addresses e.g. a MAC address for network layer 2 an IP address for network layer 3 etc. and can send and receive network data to and from other network elements over the network.

The OVSs of some embodiments route network traffic between network elements coupled to the OVSs. For example in this example each OVS routes network data between VMs that are running on the host on which the OVS is running OVSs running on other hosts in the rack of hosts and the TOR switching element of the rack.

By running a software switching element and several VMs on a host the number of end machines or network hosts in the network may increase. Moreover when a software switching element and several VMs are run on hosts in the racks of hosts the network topology of the network is changed. In particular the TOR switching elements are no longer edge switching elements. Instead the edge switching elements in this example are the software switching elements running on the hosts since these software switching elements are the last switching elements before end machines i.e. VMs in this example in the network. While the examples of software switching elements are open virtual switches OVSs in this example in some embodiments different types of software switching elements might be used in order to implement the logical switching elements.

The network controllers and perform similar functions as the network controllers and described above by reference to and also are for managing edge switching elements. As such the network controllers and manage the software switches that are running on the hosts in the rack of hosts .

The above illustrate a network control system for managing physical switching elements and a network control system for managing software switching elements respectively. However the network control system of some embodiments can manage both physical switching elements and software switching elements. illustrates an example of such a network control system. In particular this figure conceptually illustrates a network control system of some embodiments for managing TOR switching element and software switching elements running on hosts in the racks of hosts and .

The network controllers and perform similar functions as the network controllers and which described above by reference to and also are for managing edge switching elements. In this example the managed switching element and the software switching elements running on the hosts in the racks of hosts and are edge switching elements because they are the last switching elements before end machines in the network. In particular the network controller manages the TOR switching element and the OVSs that are running on the hosts in the rack of hosts and the network controller manages the OVSs that are running on the hosts in the rack of hosts .

The above figures illustrate examples of network controllers that control edge switching elements in a network. However in some embodiments the network controllers can control non edge switching elements as well. illustrates a network control system that includes such network controllers. In particular conceptually illustrates a network control system of some embodiments for managing TOR switching elements and OVSs running on hosts in the racks of hosts and .

As shown in the network controllers and manage edge switching elements and non edge switching elements. Specifically the network controller manages the TOR switching elements and and the software switches running on the hosts in the rack of hosts . The network controller manages TOR switching element and the software switching elements running on the hosts in the rack of hosts . In this example the TOR switching element and the software switching elements running on the hosts in the racks of hosts and are edge switching elements and the TOR switching elements and are non edge switching elements. The network controllers and perform similar functions as the network controllers and which are described above by reference to .

In some embodiments several individual logical networks such as those shown above in can be logically connected together to form a larger multi level logical network. In order to interconnect multiple logical networks some embodiments provide a hierarchical network control system that includes a hierarchical arrangement of network controllers. A set of higher level network controllers receives a specification of a higher level logical datapath set that includes the machines of all of the lower level logical networks to be interconnected. The higher level network controllers generate flow entries that are passed down to the lower level network controllers. These lower level network controllers modify the flow entries to incorporate lower level logical datapath set information then configure the managed switching elements within their respective networks in order to implement the higher level logical datapath set on top of their own respective lower level logical datapath sets. In this case the higher level logical datapath set serves to interconnect the lower level logical datapath sets thereby interconnecting the networks.

The hierarchical controller arrangement in turn results in hierarchical processing of packets by the switching elements within the network. As stated the higher level network controllers generate flow tables that implement the highest level logical datapath set that governs packet forwarding between end machines of the network then pass these tables down to the lower level network controllers. The lower level network controllers then incorporate the received higher level flow entries into their own flow tables that implement the lower level logical datapath sets. Each set of lowest level network controllers generates flow tables for the managed switching elements within the network of the controller set and passes these generated flow tables to the managed switching elements. These flow tables specify lookup entries that the managed switching elements use to process packets within the logical network. When a switching element receives a packet on a physical port the switching element maps the packet to logical ports of the hierarchical data paths makes a forwarding decision to an egress port at the highest level and maps the identified egress port back down through the hierarchy of data paths to a physical egress port.

The above description of focuses on a single managed network with one controller or cluster of controllers implementing a logical switching element within the physical switching elements of the network. In some embodiments the machines connected by the logical switching element may be physically located in a single data center or across several data centers. For instance in the rack of hosts might be in a first location while the racks of hosts and are located in a second location. In between two or more locations is an interconnecting network of unmanaged switching elements routers etc. e.g. the Internet a different local network etc. .

Some embodiments use a particular type of managed switching element to connect a managed network at a particular location e.g. a data center with one or more racks of host machines to an external unmanaged network e.g. in order to connect the machines at the data center to machines at another data center through the unmanaged network . illustrates a network that spans two data centers and . The first data center includes managed switching elements and . The managed switching elements and are edge switching elements to which end machines either virtual machines or physical machines are connected. For instance the edge switching element might be a software switching element similar to the OVS switches in the previous section and the edge switching element might be a TOR hardware switching element.

In addition to the edge switching elements and the first data center includes an interconnecting managed switching element which connects to the network outside the data center . The interconnecting managed switching element in some embodiments is an extender. An extender is a type of managed switching element described in detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 177 535 filed on Jul. 6 2011 and entitled Hierarchical Managed switching element Architecture which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments an extender enables communication between a machine within the managed network and external machines by adding to incoming packets and removing from outgoing packets logical context IDs that indicate that a packet belongs to and is routed on a particular logical datapath set.

In the second data center also includes several managed edge switching elements and connected to several machines as well as an interconnecting managed switching element . In some embodiments this interconnecting managed switching element is also an extender with the two extenders and communicating through the external network . In some embodiments in order for these two managed switching elements and to communicate a tunnel is defined through the network between the managed switching elements. In some embodiments the network through which the tunnel is defined is a layer 3 L3 network such as an Internet Protocol IP network. Such a tunnel may be defined using Generic Routing Encapsulation GRE IP Security IPSec Stateless Transport Tunneling STT or other tunneling protocols. These tunnels enable packets to be transported over the network between the data centers and with no or minimal processing by the intervening switching routing elements that make up the network .

In addition to extenders some embodiments utilize pool nodes as interconnecting managed switching elements or use pool nodes as internal non edge managed switching elements within a managed network . Pool nodes are described in detail in application Ser. No. 13 177 535 which is incorporated by reference above. Pool nodes in some embodiments are connected to and positioned above the edge switching elements in a hierarchical switching network architecture. In some embodiments each edge switching element is only responsible for storing forwarding information for a subset of the machines connected by a logical datapath set. When a managed edge switching element does not have an entry for a destination address the edge switching element automatically forwards the packet to a pool node which stores information for a larger subset of the logical datapath set or for all machines on the logical switching element . The pool node then forwards the packet to the appropriate next switching element in order for the packet to reach its destination.

In the example shown in all of the machines at both data centers and are on a single logical switching element that implements a logical datapath set. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in some embodiments many different logical switching elements could be implemented at the same time by the managed switching elements in order to connect many different sets of machines within the data centers. These logical switching elements could connect machines in both data centers and as shown in this figure as well as implementing logical datapath sets that connect machines only within one of the data centers. For instance VM M and VMmight be connected via a first logical switching element while VM VM M and Mare connected via a second logical switching element.

In some embodiments when a packet is sent from a machine e.g. VM at the first data center to a machine e.g. VM at the second data center the interconnecting managed switching element encapsulates the packet in a tunneling protocol. This packet is transported through the network to the interconnecting managed switching element which removes the tunneling protocol.

To implement this logical switching element within the managed physical switching elements a controller cluster connects to the managed switching elements and generates and passes flow entries in the form of forwarding tables to the switching elements. In this figure as well as others within this document traffic data paths i.e. for transporting network data packets between end machines are shown as solid lines while control data paths i.e. for managing the forwarding tables of switching elements are shown as dashed lines.

As shown the controller cluster connects to each of the switching elements . In this figure the controller cluster is illustrated as located outside of either of the data centers e.g. at a third data center . However in some embodiments the cluster might be located at one of the data centers or distributed across both of the data centers and . For instance the controller cluster might consist of several controller instances some of which are located at the first data center and some of which are located at the second data center . These controller instances each manage one or more of the managed switching elements i.e. transmit flow entries that define forwarding tables to the managed switching elements . In addition the controller instances communicate with each other in order to share information e.g. about the location of physical elements within the network as well as the generated logical datapath sets for implementing a logical switching element .

The solution for interconnecting data centers illustrated in using a single logical switching element to connect all of the machines requires that the connection between the data centers be completely reliable. Even if the controller cluster includes instances at both data centers these controller instances require the ability to communicate with each other in order to propagate any changes to the physical structure of the network as well as any changes to the forwarding rules. In some cases a user enters input to define forwarding rules into a controller instance at one of the locations and this information must be propagated to the controller instances at the other location. However if connectivity to one of the data centers is lost then this could potentially cause failures even for traffic internal to one of the data centers as the network controllers would be unable to provide updates to the switching elements as the network changes e.g. as VMs are migrated to different locations .

In addition the users of the various machines at the data centers might not be the actual owners of the machines. For example in many situations the data center is owned and operated by a hosting service and numerous different customers share the use of the machines provided by the hosting services. In order to enable a customer to provision its network e.g. to set forwarding rules the provider may expose a logical datapath set for the customer. The customer may have its own set of machines e.g. at its own premises and or machines at other hosting services with each such site having a separate logical datapath set for the customer to operate. Similarly a network carrier between the hosting services and the customer might expose its connectivity as a logical datapath abstraction as well. By doing so the network carrier provides a well defined API for its customers to determine how their packets should be handled without the network carrier s personnel playing any role in these operations.

Furthermore even within a single data center a customer might need to separate their machines into separate logical switching elements. For instance the customer might want separate logical switching elements for different departments or might simply be operating so many machines that it becomes infeasible or impossible to do so with a single logical switching element. This limit may come about based on constraints of the controller or due to constraints of the logical datapath service model.

Accordingly some embodiments define multiple separate logical switching elements implemented by separate logical datapath sets then interconnect these separate logical datapath sets. This subsection describes a decentralized solution in which the interconnection of the separate logical datapath sets is established manually. Subsection describes a more centralized solution that uses multiple levels of controller clusters to implement multiple levels of logical datapath sets.

As shown in some embodiments modify this setup in order to separate the logical datapath set into separate logical datapath sets for each data center while still allowing the machines at one data center to transmit packets to the machines at the other data center and vice versa . In such embodiments each data center has a separate controller cluster to manage the switching elements at the data center. The controller cluster for example manages the hypervisor pool node and extender while the controller cluster manages the hypervisor pool node and extender . Within the first data center there could be numerous hypervisors and pool nodes connecting numerous end machines on a single logical datapath set or several different sets of machines on different users logical datapath sets .

In order for the machines at the first data center to communicate with machines at a second data center some embodiments program the controller clusters with a second level logical datapath set that includes machines from both data centers. For example if a first logical datapath set includes VMand VMin a first data center and a second logical datapath set includes VMand VMin a second data center then a third logical datapath set will include all four of VM VM VM and VMin some embodiments. This third logical datapath set is sent to the controller clusters at each of the data centers and defines a logical switching element that connects all of the machines from the first and second logical datapath sets.

A tunnel is still created between the extenders at the two sites although the extenders can function much like pool nodes would within a site by enabling the transmission of packets from a machine in one area of the logical network to a machine in another area. In addition as shown in bold in some embodiments enable a direct connection from the hypervisor to the extender bypassing the pool node . The hypervisor edge switching element recognizes that a packet is destined for a machine in the other data center and automatically forwards the packet to the extender rather than the pool node . A tunnel between the extenders and still enables the communication between the two sites and the details of packet processing and encapsulation will be described in sections below. Furthermore the hypervisor will still forward packets destined for other machines within the data center that do not have entries within the forwarding tables of the edge switching element hypervisor to the pool node .

While illustrates an architecture with separate controller clusters at different data centers some embodiments additionally involve a second level controller cluster that generates flow entries to connect the separate data centers. Specifically some embodiments define separate logical switching elements implemented by separate logical datapath sets at each data center and interconnect these separate logical datapath sets with a single or more than one second level logical datapath set that spans multiple data centers. In some cases the packet processing behavior of the setup shown in is the same or similar to the packet processing behavior of the multi level implementation described in the subsections below.

The interconnecting managed switching elements and may be different types of switching elements in different embodiments e.g. pool nodes extenders . For instance they might both be pool nodes both be extenders or a combination of the two types of switching elements. These interconnecting managed switching elements create a tunnel through the L3 network in order to send packets between the two networks when necessary. The packet processing performed by these switching elements in order to handle this interconnection between the data centers will be described below.

In addition to the first level controller clusters and the first data center also includes a second level controller cluster . As discussed above each network controller instance or each logical controller instance in the case that the cluster is separated into logical and physical controllers in the first level controller cluster includes a control application and a virtualization application. The first level controller cluster generates forwarding table entries also referred to as flow entries data flows or flows to populate the physical control plane of the managed switching elements.

In some embodiments the second level controller cluster has the same structure as the first level controller clusters with a control application and virtualization application that implement a logical switching element by generating flow entries. As with the first level controller clusters the second level controller cluster may be a single network controller instance or may consist of multiple controller instances that communicate with each other in order to update their knowledge of the network and to disseminate information regarding the generated flow entries.

However rather than connecting directly to the managed switching elements the second level controller cluster pushes its flow entries to one or more first level controller clusters in order for those first level controller clusters to implement these second level flows within the first level flow entries that they send to the managed switching elements. Thus the first level controller cluster need not include any of the machines at the data center on its logical switching element as the interconnections between machines at the data center and machines at the data center will be implemented by the second level logical switching element. As will be described in further detail in Section B below in some embodiments the virtualization application of the second level controller cluster converts flow entries from the second level logical forwarding plane directly to the first level logical forwarding plane. Because all of the forwarding data e.g. port bindings etc. is received at the second level controller cluster there is no control plane with regard to the forwarding decisions. As such the control application at the first level controllers is not involved in generating flow entries for packet forwarding. However in some embodiments the first level logical control plane may be used to enter security or other policies e.g. for conversion into ACL tables .

In the example of the second level controller cluster is located at one of the data centers specifically data center . As shown the second level controller cluster connects to the first level controller cluster at data center in order to send the flow information for the second level logical datapath sets to the first level controller cluster . In addition the second level controller cluster connects to the first level controller cluster through the unmanaged network . In some embodiments the second level controller cluster actually passes the control data through the tunnel between the two interconnecting managed switching elements and that connects the two data centers. However the dashed line is shown separately here in order to indicate the flow of control data as compared to network traffic .

There is no requirement that the second level controller must be located at one of the data centers however. illustrates an alternate implementation of a managed network with multiple levels of controller clusters. In this case the second level controller cluster is located outside of both of the data centers and . This location might be a tenant s location i.e. the owner of the machines interconnected by the logical switching elements or at a third data center. Some embodiments attempt to locate the second level controller at the most well connected of the possible locations. For instance if connecting three data centers then the second level controller might be located at the data center with the best connection e.g. the most redundant and or fastest connection to the other two.

While the ability of the second level controller to connect to the different data centers or domains is important part of the goal of the federated approach is to ensure that the separate domains can operate independently if a domain is cut off either from the other domains or from the second level controllers. If for example the connection between the first data center and the second data center were to go down each of the first level controller clusters could still maintain and update the logical datapath sets for their respective sites maintaining connectivity within the sites. Similarly if the second level controller cluster were cut off the two first level controller clusters would continue managing their respective data center logical datapath sets.

As such the second level controller of some embodiments does not need to be aware of the actual physical network topology within a data center. While the second level controller needs to account for which end machines are located in which domain the controller need not know where the different machines are located within a domain. Thus physical changes such as VM migration within a data center need not be pushed up to the second level controller as it will not affect the second level logical switching element. This information will still be gathered by the first level controller as it may require updating the first level flow entries sent to the different managed switching elements. For instance if a particular VM moves from a first hypervisor to a second hypervisor then the first level network controller for the logical network containing the particular VM will need to generate new flow entries for various switching elements e.g. updating pool nodes the first and second hypervisors etc. .

When an end machine is moved from one domain to a different domain connected by the second level logical switching element then the second level controller cluster may be involved in some embodiments. In this regard different embodiments may distribute the functionality differently between the first and second level controllers. In a more centralized approach the second level controller receives updates any time a machine moves between domains then generates and pushes forwarding table entries. In a more decentralized approach the second level controller pushes an entry indicating that the first level controllers should use a distributed learning algorithm to handle the move of the end machine from one domain to the other. Such a distributed learning algorithm might be implemented using a standard flooding based approach or by relying on a lookup service based model that does not require any flooding.

The ability of the separate domains to function in isolation however does not mean that connectivity between the second level controllers and first level controllers is unimportant. As such some embodiments interconnect the second level controllers to each site independently with enough redundant paths to provide a desired level of reliability. Some embodiments rely on gossiping to guarantee a reliable system of updates from the second level controller to the different first level controllers at different sites. To implement this gossiping some embodiments utilize a distributed protocol specialized for the delivery of flow entries.

Irrespective of the approach used to disseminate updates to the flow entries in some embodiments the second level flow entries may not make it to switching elements at the different first level domains at exactly the same time e.g. because of different travel times from the second level controller to the different first level controllers or different processing times at the different first level controllers . Thus some embodiments instruct the first level controllers to include versioning information in the packet processing pipeline so that the managed switching elements add this versioning information to each packet received from an end machine. Thus a single packet will use the same network state version across multiple domains. In this manner the second level controller can push the state in stages. Only after preparing a new network state version far enough the system enables the use of the new version at the network edge and only after updating all of the edges to the new version will the earlier version be removed.

In addition to connecting machines on different first level logical switching elements at different data centers or other locations some embodiments use a federated approach within a single data center. illustrates such a data center that includes a first domain managed by a first level controller cluster and a second domain managed by a different first level controller cluster . In order to interconnect these two domains the data center also includes a second level controller cluster that implements a logical switching element over both of the domains and pushes down the second level flows to the two first level controller clusters and . In this case the interconnecting managed switching elements on the edges of the domains are more likely to be pool nodes as there is no external unmanaged network through which to connect although as is the case in all of the figures there may be unmanaged switching elements that are not shown in between the managed switching elements .

Some embodiments use this federated approach within a single data center for different reasons. For instance the size of a single first level logical datapath set may be constrained by either the underlying controller implementation or by the constraints of the logical datapath service model. While the second level logical switching element may have the same number of logical ports as would a first level logical switching element connecting all the machines on a logical datapath set the flow entries for the second level logical datapath set will be simpler because they only need to handle traffic going from one of the first level domains to the other first level domain.

As mentioned above in the federated system flow entries are generated initially by the second level controller then pushed down to the appropriate first level controller s which generate flow entries to push down to the managed switching elements. Within this and later sections 1L may be used to refer to the first level logical datapath sets and network controllers. Similarly 2L may be used to refer to the second level logical datapath sets and network controllers. These terms are intended to be different from L1 and L2 that often refer to the Open Systems Interconnect OSI physical and data link layers.

Section I above described the use of a network controller or controller cluster in a single level logical network to generate a logical datapath set and create flows that are pushed down to the managed switching elements. The network controller of some embodiments includes a control application for converting logical control plane data to logical forwarding plane data and a virtualization application for converting logical forwarding plane data to physical control plane data. In some embodiments each of these sets of data logical control plane logical forwarding plane physical control plane are stored in the network controller as n Log tables and the control and virtualization applications perform n Log table mapping operations to convert from one data plane to the next using an n Log rules engine. In some embodiments in fact the control application and virtualization application use the same rules engine to perform their table mappings. The physical control plane data is then pushed to the managed switching elements.

For a network with multiple levels of controller clusters in some embodiments the controller clusters at each level of the hierarchy perform additional conversions of the flows e.g. using n Log table mapping engines . conceptually illustrates a control data pipeline for a hierarchically arranged set of network controllers at two levels that manage a federated network. Specifically conceptually illustrates a 2L network controller and two separate 1L network controllers and for two different 1L domains.

As shown the 2L network controller includes a control application and a virtualization application . The control application converts 2L logical control plane data into 2L logical forwarding plane data. In some embodiments the control application exposes constructs with which the control application itself or users of the application i.e. the owners of the logical datapath sets define the logical datapath set within the logical control plane. The logical control plane data of some embodiments includes logical access control list ACL data that may be specified by the user e.g. to define security policy . In addition the 2L logical control plane data may include logical forwarding records generated by the control application in response to changes in the network detected by the managed switching elements and pushed up through the 1L network controllers. At least some of the 2L logical control data of some embodiments may be specified without consideration for a current arrangement of managed switching elements and how the logical datapath set will actually be converted into data for the different switching elements.

The control application receives this 2L logical control plane data as input and applies its table mapping rules to generate 2L logical forwarding plane data as output. The 2L logical forwarding plane data includes lookup entries that define the logical datapath set based on the 2L logical control plane data. In some embodiments for example the control plane might define that a particular MAC address is located at a particular logical port. This 2L control plane data however does not provide an actual lookup entry. The 2L logical forwarding plane data generated by the control application defines that if a packet destination matches the particular MAC address then the packet should be forwarded to the particular logical port. This 2L control plane data however does not provide any context for the packet. This essentially turns a piece of data into a lookup entry.

The control application pushes the 2L logical forwarding plane data to the virtualization application . As shown the virtualization application takes the 2L logical forwarding plane data as input and outputs 1L logical forwarding plane data. In some embodiments the 1L logical forwarding plane data adds a match of the 2L datapath to the lookups. For instance in the example above the 1L logical forwarding plane lookup determines that if a packet has matched the particular 2L datapath e.g. via ingress port matching and matches the particular destination MAC address then the packet should be forwarded to the particular logical port.

The virtualization application pushes the logical forwarding plane data to the two 1L network controllers and . These 1L network controllers in some embodiments receive the logical forwarding plane data customized to their particular logical domain. That is in some embodiments certain entries are only pushed to the network controllers that need the entry though this would not be the case for the attachment of a new VM for a port which would be sent to all 1L domains . At each of the 1L controllers a virtualization application takes the logical forwarding plane data for the domain and converts the logical forwarding plane data into physical control plane data for the managed switching elements in the domain. In the above described example for a newly attached machine the physical control plane lookup determines that if a packet has matched the particular 1L datapath and has matched the particular 2L datapath and matches the particular destination MAC address then the packet should be forwarded to the particular logical port. In this case two separate physical control plane lookups are generated by the two different 1L network controllers. For the first network controller the lookup requires a match to the particular 1L datapath defined by that network controller for its 1L domain. Similarly a different lookup is generated for the network controller that requires a match to its particular 1L datapath.

As with the control and virtualization applications at the 2L controller the virtualization application of the 1L controller of some embodiments uses an n Log table mapping engine to perform this conversion. The physical control plane data of some embodiments is data readable by the managed switching elements which the managed switching elements convert into physical forwarding plane lookups. In some embodiments the 1L network controllers include push the physical control plane data to the appropriate managed switching elements within the network.

In this figure no logical control plane is illustrated for the 1L network controllers. Because the actual forwarding decisions are made at the 2L level no 1L logical control plane data is required or used in some embodiments. However in some embodiments administrators of the 1L domain can use the 1L network controller to configure logical control plane data for their particular domain. For instance additional security policy may be set at the 1L logical control plane in some embodiments.

The above description shows a simple case in which a single 2L logical datapath set connects two 1L logical datapath sets. As will be described in subsequent sections in some embodiments additional 1L datapaths may be connected by a 2L datapath and additional levels of logical datapath sets may be used to provide additional discretization of the network. For a three level network the control data pipeline would include only a 3L logical control plane with the lookups converted to 3L 2L and 1L logical forwarding plane data. More generally for any number of levels in some embodiments there is only one logical control plane at the topmost level with lookups converted to logical forwarding plane data at each subsequent level of network controller.

This example illustrates the 1L network controller converting data directly from the logical forwarding plane to the physical control plane which includes data customized to the different managed switching elements. However for some embodiments this represents a simplification. In such embodiments the 1L network controller virtualization application converts the logical data path set from the 1L logical forwarding plane to universal physical control plane UPCP data that is generic for any managed switching element that implements the logical datapath set within the 1L domain. In some embodiments this virtualization application is part of a controller instance that is a master controller for the particular logical datapath set within the 1L domain also referred to as the logical controller .

In some embodiments the UPCP data is then converted to customized physical control plane CPCP data for each particular managed switching element by a controller instance that is a master physical controller instance for the particular managed switching element or by a chassis controller for the particular managed switching element. When the chassis controller generates the CPCP data the chassis controller obtains the UPCP data from the virtualization module of the logical controller through the physical controller.

Irrespective of whether the physical controller or chassis controller generate the CPCP data the CPCP data for a particular managed switching element needs to be propagated to the managed switching element. In some embodiments the CPCP data is propagated through a network information base NIB data structure which in some embodiments is an object oriented data structure. Several examples of using the NIB data structure are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 177 529 and 13 177 533 which are incorporated by reference above. As described in these applications the NIB data structure is also used in some embodiments to may serve as a communication medium between different controller instances and to store data regarding the logical datapath sets e.g. logical switching elements and or the managed switching elements that implement these logical datapath sets.

However other embodiments do not use the NIB data structure to propagate CPCP data from the physical controllers or chassis controllers to the managed switching elements to communicate between controller instances and to store data regarding the logical datapath sets and or managed switching elements. For instance in some embodiments the physical controllers and or chassis controllers communicate with the managed switching elements through OpenFlow entries and updates over the configuration protocol. Also in some embodiments the controller instances use one or more direct communication channels e.g. RPC calls to exchange data. In addition in some embodiments the controller instances e.g. the control and virtualization modules of these instance express the logical and or physical data in terms of records that are written into the relational database data structure. In some embodiments this relational database data structure are part of the input and output tables of a table mapping engine called n Log that is used to implement one or more modules of the controller instances.

For a two level network e.g. that shown in conceptually illustrates a process performed by the second level network controller of some embodiments to generate flow entries for an event detected at the logical control plane. As shown the process begins by receiving at an update to the 2L logical control plane. Such an update may be a user entering a particular ACL policy e.g. enabling port security or machine isolation for a particular port requiring a particular QoS for a particular machine at a particular port etc. . In addition updates may be received at the control plane after being pushed upwards from the managed switching elements. When a new machine is attached to a particular managed switching element this network information is pushed up to the 1L network controller that manages the particular switching element then from the 1L controller to the 2L controller. In some embodiments the user will have configured the logical ports of the first and second logical switching elements to which the newly detected machine should be bound.

The process then determines at whether the update to the 2L logical control plane requires the creation of new flow entries. For instance if the update simply indicates that the network has not changed then no new entries will be required and the process ends. On the other hand if the update specifies new ACL rules or indicates the attachment of a new VM then the 2L network controller will begin generating new flow entries.

Next the process translates at the 2L logical control plane update into an update to the lookups in the 2L logical forwarding plane. As mentioned above in some embodiments this translation involves turning a piece of data into a lookup entry. Throughout the process and the process shown in described below several examples will be used to illustrate the translation of logical control plane data into physical control plane data. The first example is that given in simple terms above the attachment of a new machine having a MAC address A to a particular logical port X of the 2L logical datapath set. In this case the logical control plane data states MAC A is at logical Port X . The control application translates this event into an update to the 2L LDPS lookup table that reads If destination matches MAC A forward to Port X .

The second example described here illustrates the generation of ACL table entries. While the conversions related to the hierarchical network are feature agnostic e.g. the addition of match conditions examples will be given for the specific example of port security. Thus at the logical control plane the user specifies that a particular port should be secured e.g. Port X that is that network data entering and exiting the logical switching element through the particular port have only certain addresses that the switching element has restricted the port to use. For this example the user has secured Port X restricted to MAC address A and IP address B. Other examples of ACL rules that a user could specify include counters i.e. counting the number of packets coming from a particular source address or to a destination address machine isolation i.e. only sending broadcast multicast packets received from a particular machine to a particular set of machines QoS enablement i.e. requiring a particular quality of service for packets sent from or to a particular port etc.

For the port security the control plane data simply specifies that Port X should be secure with MAC A and IP B as the allowed addresses. The logical forwarding plane converts this into an ingress ACL entry and an egress ACL entry. At this point the entries are similar to those that would be used in a single level logical network. For the ingress ACL the entry specifies that a packet entering the logical switching element from Port X is allowed if the packet has A as the source MAC address and B as the source IP address and dropped if the MAC address or IP address are different. Furthermore Address Resolution Protocol ARP responses must correspond to the correct address i.e. the MAC address must be A and the IP address must be B in the source response or the packet will be dropped . Logically the lookup instruction might state If received from Ingress Port X Allow or Drop If ARP MAC not A or IP not B or Drop If MAC not A or IP not B . This effectively prevents the machine at Port X from using other MAC or IP addresses than those assigned to it. Similarly the egress ACL lookup prevents packets not sent to the correct address from exiting the switching element at Port X with an instruction of If sent to Egress Port X Drop If dest. IP not B . This prevents other IP addresses from being used at Port X by the nature of the logical forwarding packets sent to MAC addresses other than A will not be directed to Port X in the first place.

After translating the logical control plane update into a 2L logical forwarding plane lookup s the process then translates at the 2L logical forwarding plane data into 1L logical forwarding plane lookup entries. As with the 2L logical control plane to 2L forwarding plane translation in some embodiments the conversion from 2L logical forwarding plane to 1L logical forwarding plane is performed as an n Log table mapping operation e.g. using the same table mapping engine as for the 2L logical control plane to 2L logical forwarding operation . For both the ACL lookups and the attachment of a new machine the virtualization application adds a match of the 2L LDPS to the entry. Thus the first entry now states If match 2L LDPS and destination matches MAC A forward to Port X . The ingress ACL entry at the 1L logical forwarding plane reads If match 2L LDPS and If received from Ingress Port X Allow or Drop If ARP MAC not A or IP not B or Drop If MAC not A or IP not B . Similarly the egress ACL entry reads If match 2L LDPS and If sent to Egress Port X Drop If dest. IP not B .

In addition to translating the 2L logical forwarding lookups to 1L logical forwarding lookups the process also generates at additional 1L logical forwarding plane entries in order to realize the 2L lookups within the 1L logical forwarding plane. In some embodiments the virtualization application rules engine creates additional flow entries to handle the operations around the forwarding lookups. These include ingress and egress port integration lookups to handle the ingress context mapping and egress context mapping described below as well as additional entries to handle the tunnels between different 1L domains i.e. for packets not originating in the destination domain .

In some embodiments these lookup entries are generated as soon as a new machine is added at a particular port and the 1L and 2L logical ports are bound to the same machine. Thus when ACL entries are generated for a particular port these additional 1L logical forwarding entries are not affected. Continuing to refer to the example of a machine with MAC address A and IP address B at Port X the virtualization application of some embodiments generates four types of entries ingress port integration egress port integration tunnel sending and tunnel receiving. The ingress port integration entry matches the 1L port Port K to which the machine is bound to the 2L Port X to which the machine is also bound. Thus this entry states If received from 1L ingress Port K Mark 2L ingress as Port X . In order to generate such an entry the virtualization application uses input tables that correspond the port bindings between the two levels based on user provided information .

The egress port integration entry matches a forwarding decision at the 2L level to a 1L port. Specifically for the continuing example the egress port integration entry states If sent to Port X Run through egress pipeline then send to Port K . Thus a packet forwarded to Port X at the 2L level will be first sent to the egress pipeline at which point the egress ACL rules are applied to the packet then sent to the 1L Port K. As with the ingress port integration input tables specifying port bindings are used by the virtualization application to generate such egress port integration entries. In some embodiments both the ingress and egress port integration lookups are written specifically for the 1L domain that actually contains Port K. Only packets originating from Port K will need to be mapped to Port X and packets destined for Port X will only need to be mapped to Port K once received at the 1L domain.

In addition to the ingress and egress port integration lookups some embodiments also generate lookups to handle the receipt and transmission of packets sent through different 1L LDPS than the 1L LDPS containing Port X. The ingress 2L port and the egress 2L port might be in different 1L LDPS and therefore the packet will have to travel along the tunnels between these 1L domains. Thus two lookups at the sending side of the tunnel and the receiving side of the tunnel are generated for the 1L logical forwarding plane. For any 1L LDPS that does not contain Port X and that connects directly to the 1L LDPS that does contain Port X the virtualization application generates a tunnel encapsulation lookup entry that states If sent to Port X Encapsulate with X s context ID and output to 1L Port that connects to destination 1L LDPS . For the receiving side of the tunnel i.e. the 1L LDPS that contains Port X the virtualization application generates a tunnel decapsulation lookup entry that states If tunneled Decapsulate to identify 2L port then Resubmit . The resubmission results in the execution of the egress port integration described above.

In some embodiments the 1L datapaths are not a full mesh. That is there may not be a direct connection between each pair of 1L domains within the 2L domain. In some such embodiments additional lookup entries are generated for sending packets to the appropriate tunnels from 1L domains that do not directly connect to the domain containing Port K. For each such 1L domain the virtualization application generates a lookup stating that If sent to Port X Encapsulate with X s context ID and output to 1L Port that connects to appropriate next 1L LDPS . Correspondingly for any 1L domain that does not contain Port K but that can receive a packet destined for MAC B over such a tunnel the virtualization application generates a lookup stating that If tunneled Decapsulate to identify 2L port then Resubmit . The resubmission will then result in the eventual execution of the next tunnel to the next 1L datapath.

To generate the tunneling lookups the rules engine of the virtualization application uses an input table that defines the interconnections between the different 1L logical datapath sets. Such an input table defines the ports of the 1L LDPS that connect to other 1L LDPS. In addition some embodiments use tables generated at the 2L control plane that define pathways through the 1L datapaths for packets that originate in a 1L domain that does not directly connect to the destination 1L domain i.e. whether packets should be forwarded through a first domain or a second domain that both directly connect to the destination 1L domain . In different embodiments these pathways may be defined by a user or by an optimization algorithm that combines network data with user entered traffic policies e.g. QoS guarantees traffic classification etc. .

With all of the 1L logical forwarding plane entries generated for the update the process identifies at the 1L controllers to receive the generated lookups. As described for some of the different lookup entries above not all controllers will receive every lookup as some lookups may not be needed for the managed switching elements in some 1L domains. For example the tunnel sending lookups will not need to be sent to the 1L domain containing the destination port and the tunnel receiving lookup will not need to be sent to the 1L domains that will never receive packets sent to the destination port. Depending on the complexity of the network and the defined pathways through the domains in some cases all domains might be potential recipients. The egress and ingress port integration lookups as well as certain egress pipeline entries e.g. the egress ACL for port security will only be sent to the 1L controller at the 1L domain containing the port being mapped. On the other hand the forwarding entries and the ingress pipeline entries of some embodiments are sent to all of the 1L domains as any of these domains might have a machine sending a packet to the machine at Port X.

Finally the process pushes at the generated flow entries to the identified 1L controllers then ends. In some embodiments the 2L controller propagates the generated flow entries to the 1L controller through an object oriented NIB data structure while other embodiments use direct communication channels e.g. RPC calls to exchange the flow entries.

Next the process translates at the 1L logical forwarding plane lookups into physical control plane lookups. As with the translation operations performed by process in some embodiments the conversion from 1L logical forwarding plane to physical control plane is performed as an n Log table mapping operation. The rules engine used by the 1L controller is the same rules engine with different input tables as that used by the 2L controller in some embodiments. For both the ACL lookups and the forwarding entry for the new machine attached to the network the virtualization application adds a match of the 1L LDPS to the entry. Thus the entry for forwarding packets to Port X now states If match 1L LDPS and If match 2L LDPS and If destination matches MAC A forward to Port X . The ingress ACL entry at the physical control plane reads If match 1L LDPS and If match 2L LDPS and If received from Ingress Port X Allow or Drop If ARP MAC not A or IP not B or Drop If MAC not A or IP not B . Similarly the egress ACL entry reads If match 1L LDPS and If match 2L LDPS and If sent to Egress Port X Drop If dest. IP not B . This egress ACL entry in some embodiments is only generated by the 1L network controller at the domain containing Port X as the other 1L network controllers do not receive the entry at their logical forwarding planes.

In addition to translating the 1L logical forwarding plane lookups to physical control plane lookups the process also generates at additional physical control plane lookup entries to realize the 1L logical forwarding plane over the physical network. In some embodiments the 1L virtualization application rules engine creates additional flow entries to handle the operations around the forwarding lookups. These lookups are the analogues to the entries generated by the 2L virtualization application for realizing the 2L logical forwarding plane on top of the 1L logical forwarding plane. As with the entries described earlier the lookups generated at include ingress and egress port integration entries to handle ingress context mapping and egress context mapping as well as additional entries to handle the tunnels between different managed switching elements.

In some embodiments these lookup entries are generated as soon as a new machine is added at a particular physical port e.g. a virtual interface and the 1L and 2L logical ports are bound to that physical port. When ACL entries are generated for a particular port these additional physical control plane entries are not affected. For the sake of the examples the physical port to which the machine located at 1L logical Port K and 2L logical Port X is connected is Port J in the ongoing examples. Continuing with this example the ingress port integration entry for this level matches the physical Port J to which the machine is connected to the 1L port K to which the machine is bound. Thus this entry states If received from physical ingress Port J Mark 1L ingress as Port K . In order to generate such an entry the virtualization application uses input tables that correspond the port bindings between the physical and logical levels based on user provided information .

The egress port integration entry matches a forwarding decision as mapped to the 1L logical level to a physical port. Specifically for the continuing example the egress port integration entry becomes If sent to Port K Run through egress pipeline then send to Port J . Thus a packet forwarded to Port K at the 1L level will be first sent to the egress pipeline and then sent to the physical Port J. As with the ingress port integration input tables specifying port bindings are used by the 1L virtualization application to generate such egress port integration entries. In some embodiments both the ingress and egress port integration lookups are written specifically for the managed switching element e.g. a hypervisor that actually contains Port J. Only packets originating at this port will need to be mapped to Port K and packets destined for Port K will only need to be mapped to physical Port J once received at the managed switching element.

In addition to the ingress and egress port integration lookups some embodiments also generate lookups to handle the receipt and transmission of packets through different managed switching elements within the 1L domain containing Port K. Packets might originate at other managed switching elements within the domain or originate in a different 1L domain and enter via an interconnecting switching element. In this case the packet will have to travel along at least one tunnel between two managed switching elements within the 1L domain in order to reach the switching element containing Port J. Thus two lookups at the sending and receiving sides of the tunnel are generated for the physical control plane. For any managed switching element that does not contain Port J and that connects directly to the switching element that does contain Port J the interconnecting managed switching element for the 1L domain is often such a switching element the virtualization application generates a tunnel encapsulation lookup entry that states If sent to Port K Encapsulate with K s context ID and output to physical port via tunnel that connects to destination switch . For the receiving side of the tunnel i.e. at the managed switching element that contains Port J the virtualization application generates a tunnel decapsulation lookup entry that states If tunneled Decapsulate to identify 1L port then Resubmit . The resubmission results in the execution of the egress port integration described above.

In some embodiments the managed switching elements may not be a full mesh. Packets incoming from other 1L domains are generally sent directly from the interconnecting managed switching element to the destination managed switching element in some embodiments. On the other hand for networks with pool nodes the path from a first managed edge switching element within the 1L domain passes through one or more pool nodes in order to reach a second managed edge switching element to which the destination machine connects in some cases. In some such embodiments additional lookup entries are generated for sending packets to the appropriate tunnels from managed switching elements that do not directly connect to the destination managed switching element containing Port J. For each such switching element the virtualization application generates a lookup stating that If sent to Port K Encapsulate with K s context ID and output to physical port via tunnel that connects to appropriate next managed switch . Correspondingly for any managed switching element that does not contain Port J but can receive a packet destined for MAC B over such a tunnel the virtualization application generates a lookup stating that If tunneled Decapsulate to identify 1L port then Resubmit . In this case the resubmission results in the eventual execution of the next tunnel to the next managed switching element.

To generate the tunneling lookups the rules engine of the virtualization application uses an input table that lists the physical ports connected to each managed switching element as well as an input table defining the connections between the different managed switching elements i.e. indicating through which additional switching elements a packet will have to travel in order to reach a particular destination switching element from a particular originating switching element . In addition to configure the tunnels some embodiments use an input table that identifies which types of tunnels are allowed for particular managed switching elements e.g. hypervisors pool nodes extenders etc. . In order to connect two managed switching elements the rules engine of some embodiments selects a shared tunnel type.

With all of the physical control plane entries generated for the update received at the logical forwarding plane the process identifies at the managed switching elements to receive the generated lookups. As described for some of the various lookup entries generated at and not all of the managed switching elements within the 1L domain will receive every lookup. For example the tunnel sending lookups will not be sent to the managed switching element to which the destination machine actually connects and the tunnel receiving lookup will not need to be sent to any managed switching elements that will never receive packets sent to the destination machine in question. Depending on the complexity of the pathways through the 1L domain in some cases all of the switching elements might be potential recipients. In many situations though at least some of the other edge switching elements will never receive packets destined for the machine in question except directly from the machines connected to those edge switching elements . The egress and ingress port integration lookups as well as certain egress pipeline entries e.g. the egress ACL for port security will only be sent to the managed edge switching element containing the secured port. On the other hand the forwarding entries and ingress pipeline entries of some embodiments are sent to all of the managed switching elements within the domain as any of these switching elements might have a machine sending a packet to the machine at Port J.

Finally the process pushes at the generated flow entries to the identified managed switching elements then ends. In some embodiments the 1L network controller communicates directly with the managed switching elements. However in other embodiments the 1L network controller that performs the conversion of the 1L logical forwarding plane data into the physical control plane data sends physical control plane data to master controllers for the particular switching elements that are to receive the data and these master controllers push the data to the switching elements. In addition while this example describes the computation of physical control plane data customized for particular switching elements e.g. with port numbers of the particular switching elements some embodiments compute universal physical control plane data that is generic to any particular switching element. In this case either the master controller or a chassis controller at the managed switching element performs the conversion to customized physical control plane data for the managed switching elements. In some embodiments the 1L controller propagates the generated flow entries e.g. to the master controller from the master controller to the managed switching elements through an object oriented NIB data structure while other embodiments use direct communication channels e.g. RPC calls OpenFlow entries updates over the configuration protocol to exchange the flow entries.

As shown the control application includes an API input tables a rules engine output tables and a publisher . The API provides an interface for translating input into the control plane input tables . This API may be used by various types of management tools with which a user can view and or modify the state of a multi level logical network in this case a two level network . In some embodiments the management tools provide a user interface such as a graphical user interface that allows a visual configuration of port bindings ACL rules etc. e.g. through a web browser . Alternatively or in conjunction with the graphical user interface some embodiments provide the user with a command line tool or other type of user interface.

Based on the information received through the API as well as updates to the network state received from the 1L controller not shown the control application generates the input tables . The input tables represent the state of the logical switching elements managed by the user in some embodiments. As shown in this figure some of the input tables include the association of MAC addresses IP addresses with logical ports of the 2L logical switching element as well as ACL rules set by the user. In this case the Port X is associated with MAC address A and IP address B and is secured.

The rules engine of some embodiments performs various combinations of database operations on different sets of input tables to populate and or modify different sets of output tables . As described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 288 908 incorporated herein by reference in some embodiments the rules engine is an n Log table mapping engine that maps a first set of n Log tables into a second set of n Log tables. The output tables populated by the rules engine of the control application include 2L logical forwarding plane lookups e.g. mapping a MAC address to a destination output port and 2L logical forwarding plane ACL entries e.g. securing Port X .

The publisher is also described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 288 908 and publishes or sends the output tables to the virtualization application in order for the virtualization application to use the output tables among its input tables. In some embodiments the publisher also outputs the tables to an object oriented data structure NIB that stores network state information.

The 2L virtualization application receives the output tables of the control application and converts this 2L logical forwarding plane data to 1L logical forwarding plane data. As shown the 2L virtualization application includes a subscriber input tables a rules engine output tables and a publisher . The subscriber of some embodiments is responsible for retrieving tables published by the publisher of the control application . In some embodiments the subscriber retrieves these tables from the same object oriented data structure to which the publisher stores the table information. In other embodiments a change in the tables is detected by the virtualization application in order to initiate the processing.

The input tables include in some embodiments at least some of the output tables in addition to other tables. As shown in addition to the 2L logical forwarding plane data the input tables include port binding information that indicates for each 2L port the 1L port bound to the same MAC and IP address and that 1L port s 1L logical datapath set . In addition some embodiments include interconnection information that describes the pathways for packets to take through the different 1L domains. In some embodiments this information is generated by the user through the user interface. Other embodiments use user policies and network data to optimize the pathways as described below by reference to .

In some embodiments the rules engine is the same as the rules engine . That is the control application and the virtualization application actually use the same rules engine in some embodiments. As indicated the rules engine performs various combinations of database operations on different sets of input tables to populate and or modify different sets of output tables . In some embodiments the rules engine is an n Log table mapping engine that maps a first set of n Log tables into a second set of n Log tables. The output tables populated by the rules engine include 1L logical forwarding plane lookups e.g. mapping a MAC Address to a destination logical port when the 2L LDPS is matched and 1L logical forwarding plane ACL entries e.g. securing Port X . In addition the ingress and egress port integration and tunnel sending receiving lookups are generated by the rules engine in some embodiments. In addition to the information shown in the figure some embodiments also include in the output tables the correct 1L network controllers to receive the different tables.

The publisher is similar to the publisher in some embodiments. The publisher publishes and or sends the output tables to the 1L network controllers including the controller containing virtualization application . In some embodiments the publisher also outputs the tables to an object oriented data structure NIB that stores network state information.

The 1L virtualization application is located at one of the 1L network controllers in the two level federated network. Specifically in this case the virtualization application is part of the network controller located in the 1L domain at which the machine with MAC address A located at Port X of the 2L LDPS is also located. As such the 1L virtualization application generates flows that include those for the managed switching element to which this machine directly connects.

As shown the 1L virtualization application includes a subscriber input tables a rules engine output tables and a publisher . The subscriber of some embodiments is responsible for retrieving tables published by the publisher of the 2L virtualization application specifically the tables for its particular 1L controller . In some embodiments the subscriber retrieves these tables from the same object oriented database to which the publisher stores the table information. In other embodiments changes to the output tables from the 2L virtualization application are transmitted via RPC calls to the 1L network controller.

The input tables include in some embodiments at least some of the output tables in addition to other tables. As shown in addition to the 1L logical forwarding plane data generated by the 2L virtualization application that is appropriate to the particular 1L network controller the input tables include additional port binding information matching 1L logical ports with physical ports of particular managed switching elements . In addition some embodiments include interconnection information that describes pathways through the managed switching elements of the 1L network for packets either fully contained within the network as shown in the example pathway or exiting entering the network to from other 1L domains. In some embodiments this information is generated by the user at the 2L network controller and passed down to the 1L network controller or may be generated at the 1L network controller.

In some embodiments the rules engine is similar to the rules engines and . In the situation in which the 1L network controller is located in the same hardware as the 2L network controller i.e. the same physical machine the 1L virtualization application may use the same rules engine as the 2L network controller. As indicated the rules engine performs various combinations of database operations on different sets of input tables to populate and or modify different sets of output tables . In some embodiments the rules engine is an n Log table mapping engine that maps a first set of n Log tables into a second set of n Log tables. The output tables populated by the rules engine include physical control plane lookups e.g. mapping a MAC Address to a destination logical port when the 1L and 2L LDPS is matched and physical control plane ACL entries e.g. securing Port X . In addition the ingress and egress port integration and tunnel sending receiving lookups are generated by the rules engine in some embodiments. In addition to the information shown in the figure some embodiments also include in the output tables the correct managed switching elements to receive the different tables.

Finally the publisher is similar to the publisher in some embodiments. The publisher publishes and or sends the output tables to the managed switching elements within the domain of the 1L network controller containing virtualization application . These managed switching elements may include hypervisors pool nodes extenders etc. In some embodiments the publisher outputs the tables to an object oriented data structure NIB that stores network state information.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the input and output tables shown in this figure are simplified conceptual representations of the actual tables which are generated in a database language appropriate for the rules engine e.g. n Log and may provide additional information to that shown. Furthermore different embodiments will use different sets of tables. For instance the port binding tables of some embodiments are actually a single table that binds a particular MAC address and IP address at a particular physical port of a particular hypervisor to particular 1L and 2L logical ports.

The above section described the generation of the forwarding table entries for a federated network through the second level and first level network controllers. The following section describes the processing of packets being sent from one machine to another in such a federated network with the managed switching elements using the flows generated as described above.

As shown the first level LDPS K has four ports for the VMs A B C and D as well as a fifth port that connects to the LDPS Z. The first level LDPS Z also has four ports for the four VMs E F G and H as well as a fifth port that connects to the LDPS K. The first level LDPS K logically connects machines within a first domain e.g. a first data center while the first level LDPS Z logically connects machines within a second domain e.g. a second data center . The second level LDPS that logically connects these two domains has eight ports for the eight VMs A B C D E F G and H.

The arrows in this figure illustrate logical mappings for a packet sent from VM A in the first domain to VM H in the second domain. As will be described these logical mappings are performed at one or more managed switching elements using the forwarding tables generated as described in the above section. In this case the packet enters the logical switching element at Port and is mapped to Port of the second level logical switching element . The forwarding tables that realize the second level logical switching element recognize the destination address of the packet as VM H and forward the packet to Port of the second level logical switching element actually exiting the logical switching element through Port . Port of the second level logical switching element then maps to Port of the logical switching element the first level logical switching element for the second destination domain actually entering the logical switching element through Port . These mappings will be described in detail by reference to .

As shown the packet originates from a source machine with a payload and headers . The payload contains the actual data intended for the destination machine while the headers include information appended by the source machine in order to enable the packet to reach the destination machine. For instance the headers include the source and destination machines addresses e.g. MAC addresses IP addresses etc. . These addresses are physical addresses from the perspective of the machines which are not aware of the logical network. From the perspective of the switching elements within the network between the machines however these MAC addresses are considered logical addresses as the initial managed switching element uses the destination address to perform logical forwarding and the address is kept within the encapsulation and therefore not visible to the subsequent logical switching elements.

Thus the packet leaves the source machine without any sort of logical context ID. Instead as described further below all of the logical context information is added and removed at the managed switching elements. The end machines and the network interfaces of the end machines need not be aware of the logical network over which the packet is sent. As a result the end machines and their network interfaces do not need to be configured to adapt to the logical network. Instead only the managed switching elements are configured by the network controllers.

The packet is first sent to a source hypervisor in this example. In this case the source machine from which the packet originates is a virtual machine e.g. VM A of that operates on a hypervisor running on a physical machine. Such hypervisors in some embodiments also contain software to operate as managed switching elements performing physical and logical forwarding functions for packets originating from and destined for the virtual machines operating on the hypervisor. As shown the source hypervisor executes a first level flow which includes performing second level functions. As such the source hypervisor executes the 2L flow to add 2L egress information to the packet and then completes the 1L flow to add 1L egress information to the packet. The packet exits the source hypervisor with two layers of encapsulation 2L egress information encapsulated inside 1L egress information .

As shown the process begins at by receiving a packet from a local machine at a physical ingress port. A switching element whether managed or unmanaged has several physical ports through which packets may enter or exit. In general each port can serve as both an ingress port for incoming packets and an egress port for outgoing packets although in some embodiments certain ports may be reserved for either ingress or egress specifically. The packet is received through a physical port of the switching element to which the source machine of the packet connects either directly or through other unmanaged switching elements. In the case of a packet sent from a virtual machine this switching element is often running on the hypervisor on which the virtual machine operates.

Based on the physical ingress port of the packet the process determines at the local first level logical ingress port for the packet. That is the managed switching element maps the physical ingress port to a 1L logical ingress port. In some embodiments the managed switching element bases this mapping solely on the physical port through which the packet arrived and the fact that the packet is not yet encapsulated with any 1L information. In other embodiments the managed switching element also uses the packet headers e.g. the MAC address of the source machine to determine the mapping.

Next the process determines at the second level 2L logical ingress port for the packet based on the first level logical ingress port. In some embodiments each 1L logical port corresponds to a second level logical port. For example in Port of the 1L LDPS K corresponds to Port of the 2L LDPS . As shown in operation is the beginning of the second level processing which is encompassed within the first level processing i.e. the first level logical forwarding tables realize the second level logical processing pipeline .

Now that the forwarding tables have begun 2L processing the process determines at the 2L logical egress port for the packet using the logical forwarding tables and the packet destination. That is the managed switching element examines the packet headers to determine the packet destination e.g. the MAC address and maps the identified destination to a logical port of the 2L logical switching element. This logical forwarding operation may be performed for layer 2 processing e.g. using the MAC address layer 3 processing e.g. using an Internet Protocol IP address or using any other type of network addresses. That is the concept of having hierarchical network controllers creating hierarchical logical datapath sets is not restricted to any particular type of network forwarding.

In addition to making a forwarding decision i.e. mapping to a 2L logical egress port some embodiments also perform other forwarding table operations within the 2L processing. For instance some embodiments perform ingress and or egress Access Control List ACL lookups that may contain instructions to drop a packet e.g. if the source of the packet is known to be corrupted queue a packet e.g. to enforce quality of service controls allow a packet through etc.

After determining the 2L logical egress port the process encapsulates at the packet with this second level logical egress port information. That is the managed switching element prepends information to the packet e.g. a logical context that includes the 2L egress port information. An example of such a logical context for OSI Layer 2 processing is described in detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 177 535 incorporated by reference above. The logical context described therein is a 64 bit tag that includes a 32 bit virtual routing function field for representing the logical switching element to which the packet belongs i.e. the 2L logical switching element a 16 bit logical inport field i.e. the ingress port on the 2L switching element and a 16 bit logical outport field i.e. the 2L egress port .

Some embodiments however only include the logical egress port within the logical context prepended to the packet. That is the logical context that encapsulates the packet does not include an explicit tenant ID. Instead the logical context captures the logical forwarding decision made at the first hop. From this the LDPS ID i.e. the LDPS to which the packet belongs can be determined implicitly at later switching elements by examining the logical egress port as that logical egress port belongs to a particular logical switching element . This results in a flat context identifier meaning that the switching element does not have to slice the context ID to determine multiple pieces of information within the ID. In some embodiments the egress port is a 32 bit ID. However the use of software switching elements as the managed switching elements that process the logical contexts in some embodiments enables the system to be modified at any time to change the size of the logical context e.g. to 64 bits or more whereas hardware switching elements tend to be more constrained to using a particular number of bits for a context identifier. In addition using a logical context identifier such as those described herein results in an explicit separation between logical data i.e. the egress context ID and source destination address data i.e. MAC addresses . While the source and destination addresses are mapped to the logical ingress and egress ports the information is stored separately within the packet.

Such logical networks that use encapsulation to provide an explicit separation of physical and logical addresses provide significant advantages over other approaches to network virtualization such as VLANs. For example tagging techniques e.g. VLAN use a tag placed on the packet to segment forwarding tables to only apply rules associated with the tag to a packet. This only segments an existing address space rather than introducing a new space. As a result because the addresses are used for entities in both the virtual and physical realms they have to be exposed to the physical forwarding tables. As such the property of aggregation that comes from hierarchical address mapping cannot be exploited. In addition because no new address space is introduced with tagging all of the virtual contexts must use identical addressing models and the virtual address space is limited to being the same as the physical address space. A further shortcoming of tagging techniques is the inability to take advantage of mobility through address remapping.

With the packet encapsulated with 2L context information e.g. the egress port the 2L logical processing realized by the 1L logical tables is complete. Next the process determines at a local first level logical egress port in order for the packet to reach the second level logical egress port in its encapsulation information. When the packet destination is at a remote domain this is the logical egress port for the originating first level logical switching element that connects to the remote domain containing the destination machine. In the example of this is Port of the originating LDPS K . When the packet destination is within the same domain this will be one of the other ports on the originating first level logical switching element that connects to the destination machine. The majority of the foregoing discussion however assumes that the packet destination is in a different 1L domain than the packet source.

After determining the 1L logical egress port the process encapsulates at the packet with this local first level logical egress port information. That is the managed switching element prepends information to the packet e.g. a logical context that includes the 1L egress port information. As with the 2L encapsulation the logical context information of some embodiments is a 64 bit tag that includes a 32 bit virtual routing function field for representing the logical switching element to which the packet belongs i.e. the originating 1L logical switching element a 16 bit logical inport field i.e. the ingress port on the 1L switching element and a 16 bit logical outport field i.e. the 1L egress port .

As with the 2L logical egress port some embodiments only include the 1L logical egress port within the 1L logical context prepended to the packet. That is the logical context that encapsulates the packet does not include an explicit tenant ID. Instead the 1L logical context captures the logical forwarding decision made at the first hop. From this the first level LDPS ID i.e. the 1L LDPS from which the packet originates can be determined implicitly at later switching elements within the originating domain by examining the logical egress port as that logical egress port belongs to the particular 1L logical switching element . This results in a flat context identifier meaning that the switching element does not have to slice the context ID to determine multiple pieces of information within the ID. In some embodiments the egress port is a 32 bit ID.

At this point the 1L logical forwarding is complete. The process then transmits at the twice encapsulated packet towards the physical location of the first level logical egress port and ends. In the case of a packet destination outside of the domain this physical location is an interconnection switching element e.g. an extender or a pool node located at the edge of the domain. In some embodiments this transmission actually involves multiple operations. First the 1L logical egress port is mapped to a physical address e.g. the address of the interconnection switching element or a port thereupon . Next this physical address is mapped to a physical port of the managed switching element so that the packet can be transmitted to the next hop. That is while the interconnection switching element is the ultimate destination within the local 1L domain there may be one or more physical switching elements either managed or unmanaged in between the source managed switching element and the interconnecting managed switching element.

Returning to the packet leaves the source hypervisor with a double encapsulation having the 2L egress context encapsulated inside the 1L egress context . As shown the packet destined for a remote machine in a different 1L domain travels through the local network to a local interconnection switching element e.g. an extender that connects to the remote 2L domain . The local interconnection switching element executes the local 1L flow which removes the local 1L egress context as the switching element is the physical realization of the local 1L egress port . The local interconnection switching element also executes an interconnection flow that encapsulates the packet with the ingress context of the remote 1L logical switching element i.e. the logical port of the switching element that connects to the local domain such as Port of logical switching element in .

As shown the process begins at by receiving a packet at the physical location of the packet s logical egress port. The logical egress port of a packet headed out of the network is a particular port on the logical switching element that maps to a particular port on the physical interconnection managed switching element e.g. Port of the logical switching element of . For an extender e.g. this is the physical port that faces the local network as opposed to one or more ports facing external networks .

As the packet s outermost encapsulation contains local 1L egress data the process determines at from this encapsulation that the packet is directed to the first level logical egress port which it has now reached . As such the process removes at the local first level encapsulation of the packet. In general once a packet reaches a destination that maps to a logical egress port in the encapsulation of the packet the switching element at that destination will remove the encapsulation in some embodiments as it is no longer needed .

With the local 1L processing complete the process determines at the remote first level logical ingress port using interconnection instructions contained within the forwarding tables of the managed switching element. In some embodiments the 2L network controller cluster passes these interconnection instructions to the local 1L controller which passes them to the interconnection switching element within the forwarding table information. Specifically the managed switching element uses the interconnection instructions to match the local logical egress port from the encapsulation information stripped at to a remote ingress port. In the context of Port of the originating LDPS as an egress port matches to Port of the destination LDPS as an ingress port.

The process then encapsulates at the packet with this remote first level logical ingress port information. That is the managed switching element prepends information to the packet outside the 2L egress information which is unmodified such as a logical context that includes the remote 1L ingress port information. This may be a 64 bit logical context as described above in some embodiments but without the 16 bit outport information which is determined at the remote interconnection switching element . In other embodiments the remote 1L logical ingress port is prepended to the packet without a specific LDPS ID in the same manner as the egress ports described above. Just as with the logical egress ports when the packet reaches the physical realization of the outermost logical port the encapsulation will be removed.

At this point the logical processing for the interconnection switching element is complete. The process then transmits at the twice encapsulated packet towards the physical location of the remote site and ends. Again this transmission may involve multiple operations. The managed interconnection switching element maps the logical ingress port to a physical address e.g. the address of a remote interconnection switching element then maps this physical address to a physical port of the managed interconnection switching element through which the packet can be transmitted to the next hop. In this case the next hop may be on an unmanaged network e.g. the Internet if the two 1L domains are in two different locations e.g. data centers in different cities .

In the packet is transmitted from the local originating network interconnection switching element through an interconnecting network to a remote interconnection switching element e.g. an extender pool node etc. . This remote interconnection switching element is located at the edge of the remote 1L domain e.g. the edge of a remote data center . As shown when the packet arrives at the managed switching element the switching element removes both the 1L ingress port information and the 2L egress port information then adds new 1L egress port information to the packet . This 1L egress information indicates the egress port on the local 1L logical switching element for the packet i.e. the port connected to the destination machine for the packet .

As shown the process begins by receiving at a twice encapsulated packet at the physical port connected to a remote site. This packet as shown in contains an outer encapsulation identifying the 1L ingress port local to the physical managed switching element performing the process as well as an inner encapsulation identifying the 2L egress port for the packet.

As the packet s outermost encapsulation contains local to the switching element 1L ingress data the process determines at from this encapsulation that the packet is directed to the first level logical ingress port which it has now reached at the interconnecting managed switching element . As such the process removes at the local first level encapsulation from the packet. In some embodiments whenever a switching element removes encapsulation information from a packet the switching element saves that information in a temporary storage e.g. a register of the switching element for the duration of the processing of the packet as the information may be needed for later processing.

With the 1L encapsulation removed the process determines at the second level egress port based on the 2L encapsulation of the packet. This is the logical port on the 2L switching element that maps to the packet destination. The process also removes at the second level encapsulation from the packet. As with the first level encapsulation some embodiments store this 2L information in a temporary storage e.g. a register for use in any additional processing of the packet.

At this point the packet has no encapsulation information at least as relates to the logical datapath sets of the federated network . Next the process determines at a local first level egress port based on the second level egress port. The 2L egress port from the encapsulation removed at operation maps to a particular port in the local destination 1L logical datapath set. For instance in Port of the 2L LDPS maps to Port of the destination 1L LDPS Z . While described here as using the 2L egress information to determine the 1L egress port some embodiments also use the destination address contained in the packet headers as this address also maps to the 1L egress port.

In addition some embodiments may execute egress ACL tables within the 2L processing at the receiving interconnection switching element. Some embodiments execute such egress ACL tables when the egress port of a particular logical switching element is removed. Thus in a single level logical network when a packet reaches the destination managed switching element some embodiments remove the logical context and run the packet through egress ACL tables. Similarly in this case when the receiving interconnect removes the 2L processing it may execute egress ACL tables.

The process then encapsulates at the packet with this local first level logical egress port information. As with the encapsulations performed at the source managed switching element in some embodiments the encapsulation is in the form of a context tag such as the 64 bit context tag described above. In other embodiments the context tag contains only the 1L logical egress port e.g. the 32 bit egress port described above .

Next the process transmits at the once encapsulated packet towards the physical location of the local first level egress port. In general there will not be any managed switching elements in between the interconnection managed switching element usually a non edge switching element such as an extender or pool node and the destination managed switching element an edge switching element that connects to the destination machine . As shown in some embodiments enable a direct connection between the extender and hypervisor for federated networks. In other embodiments an additional managed switching element e.g. a pool node may be located between the interconnection switching element and the destination managed switching element. In addition the network may contain intervening unmanaged switching elements. Again this transmission may involve multiple operations including mapping the 1L logical egress port to a physical destination the destination contained in the packet headers then mapping this physical address to a physical port of the managed interconnection switching element through which the packet can be transmitted to the next hop.

Returning again to the packet is transmitted with a single level of encapsulation through the destination 1L network to a destination hypervisor . This hypervisor is the edge managed switching element to which the destination machine connects specifically in this case the hypervisor on which the destination machine operates . As shown this machine executes its 1L flow to recognize its outport facing the machine as the 1L egress port remove this egress information and transmit the packet headers and payload to the destination machine.

While this example in and the subsequent process of illustrates the removal of the 2L egress port information at the remote interconnection switching element as it is no longer needed except to add the 1L egress information at that switching element some embodiments do not strip the 2L egress information until the last managed switching element that connects directly to the destination machine i.e. the location of the 2L egress port such as hypervisor . In this case the interconnection switching element at the destination domain would remove the 1L ingress information and encapsulate the packet with the 1L egress information while leaving the 2L encapsulation intact.

The previous set of figures described the packet processing performed at several of the managed switching elements within a federated network or set of networks for a packet originating in one first level network and destined for a different first level network. conceptually illustrates a different view of the processing performed by a source managed switching element i.e. the managed switching element at which a packet arrives after being sent from its source machine such as the hypervisor of . Specifically illustrates forwarding table entries for the source managed switching element .

In conjunction with the forwarding table entries conceptually illustrates the processing pipeline performed by the source managed switching element of some embodiments. As shown by the numbers 1 6 when the managed switching element receives a packet the switching element uses numerous forwarding table entries to process the packet. In some embodiments the physical 1L and 2L tables are implemented as a single table within the managed switching element e.g. using a dispatch port that returns a packet processed by a first entry to the forwarding table for processing by a second entry .

As shown in this example a VM is coupled to the managed switching element which is also coupled to a second switching element which may be a managed switching element or an unmanaged switching element . The VM sends a packet to a destination machine through two levels of logical switching elements that are implemented by the managed switching element as well as other managed switching elements.

The managed switching element receives the packet through an interface of the switching element and begins processing the packet using the forwarding tables . The first stage in the processing pipeline is an ingress context mapping stage that maps a physical ingress port i.e. the interface through which the packet was received from VM to a local 1L logical ingress port i.e. a port of the logical switching element implementing the local 1L network that corresponds to this interface . As shown by the encircled the managed switching element identifies a record in the forwarding table that implements this ingress context mapping. This record specifies that the managed switching element store the logical context in a register or meta field of the managed switching element. The logical inport is therefore stored within the switching element for the duration of the packet processing and can be used in performing additional lookups e.g. mapping to the next level ingress port . In addition in some embodiments the logical context after each of the forwarding table records is applied indicates the status of the packet within the processing pipeline i.e. in this case that a first level of ingress context mapping has been performed . The record also specifies to send the packet to the dispatch port for additional processing by the forwarding tables .

The second stage in the processing pipeline is a second ingress context mapping operation that maps the local 1L logical ingress port identified at stage to a 2L logical ingress port i.e. a port of the logical switching element implementing the 2L network . As shown by the encircled the source managed switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements this second level of ingress context mapping. At each of the levels of ingress context mapping as illustrated conceptually by the pipeline the forwarding entries map a lower level port to a logical port at the next level up. The federated network of some embodiments may have more than two levels e.g. three four etc. to allow for traffic engineering at different levels and in such cases additional records for performing ingress mapping up to each of the levels would be contained within the forwarding tables. The record specifies that the managed switching element store the logical context in a register or meta field of the managed switching element. The 2L logical inport is therefore stored within the switching element for the duration of the packet processing and can be used in performing additional lookups. The record also specifies to send the packet to the dispatch port for additional processing by the forwarding tables .

Next the managed switching element performs the third stage in the processing pipeline the forwarding lookups . These forwarding lookups are illustrated here as a single forwarding table record but may in fact involve the use of several records from several tables e.g. one or more ACL tables a layer 2 or layer 3 forwarding table etc. . The hierarchical logical forwarding concept may be applied to any type of switching routing network and therefore any sort of lookups may be implemented at this level of the processing pipeline. described below gives one such example.

The forwarding lookups perform the traditional forwarding decision for the packet by identifying an egress port based on the packet destination. Using this destination contained within the packet header the forwarding lookups identify a logical port of the 2L switching element to which the packet should be sent as well as any additional policies e.g. drop enqueue etc. that apply to the packet. These forwarding decisions are implemented by the 2L network controller which passes its generated flow records to the 1L network controller e.g. via an API exposed by the 1L network controller . The 1L network controller then implements these received instructions within its 1L flow records and passes these to the managed switching elements including the source managed switching element for application to actual traffic packets. As shown by the encircled a record which may conceptually represent several records implements these forwarding lookups and at least specifies that the managed switching element store the 2L egress port in the packet headers i.e. encapsulate the packet with the 2L egress context as well as send the packet to its dispatch port.

Based on the 2L egress port specified at the third stage of the processing pipeline the managed switching element performs egress context mapping that maps the 2L egress port to an 1L egress port. As this is performed at a managed switching element in the originating 1L network the 2L egress port maps to a port of the local 1L logical switching element. For a packet with a destination outside of the local 1L network this will be a logical port used for remote packets e.g. Port of the logical switching element in . As shown by the encircled the source managed switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements this egress context mapping. The record specifies that the managed switching element store the 1L logical egress port in the packet headers i.e. encapsulate the packet with the 1L egress context as well as send the packet to its dispatch port.

Next the managed switching element performs another level of egress context mapping at stage of the processing pipeline . Whereas the first level of egress context mapping maps a 2L logical egress port to a 1L logical egress port this second stage maps the 1L logical egress port to a physical egress port for the packet within the domain of the 1L logical network. For a packet traveling to a different 1L domain this is not the physical port of a switching element that interfaces directly with the destination machine but rather the physical port on an interconnection managed switching element that faces an external network. In some embodiments the egress context mapping back to the physical level also identifies a port on a next hop intermediate switching element e.g. by the port s MAC address . As shown by the encircled the source managed switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements this second level of egress context mapping. As with the ingress mapping in a federated network with more than two levels additional records for performing egress mapping will be contained within the forwarding tables for each of the logical levels. Each level maps an egress port at the higher level to an egress port at the lower level down to the physical level. In some embodiments the record specifies that the managed switching element store the physical egress port in the packet headers as well as send the packet to its dispatch port for further processing.

Lastly the managed switching element performs the physical mapping stage that specifies a physical port of the managed switching element through which to send the now modified packet in order to reach the physical egress port identified by the egress context mapping and therefore eventually the destination machine . As shown by the encircled the source managed switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements this physical mapping. That is the record specifies which port of the managed switching element to send the packet to in order for the packet to reach the physical address identified at stage as opposed to the dispatch port that routes the packet back into the forwarding tables .

The above description for illustrates the logical pipeline performed by the first hop managed switching element for a packet in a federated network that is being sent from one 1L logical network to a second 1L logical network. In some embodiments each managed switching element performs the same logical pipeline though with different records. However at many of these switching elements some or all of the logical context information is already stored in the packet and therefore no actual operation is performed for some of the stages. For example at an intermediate managed switching element between the first hop and the interconnection switching element the logical context would indicate that the 1L and 2L processing was already complete until the 1L egress port is reached which does not happen at the intermediate switching element. At such an intermediate switching element the only operation actually performed is the physical mapping stage to send the packet to a port of the physical switching element.

In addition not all packets within a federated network are necessarily sent from a machine in a first 1L domain to a machine in a different 1L domain. Instead packets will often be sent from a machine in the first 1L domain to a different machine in the same 1L domain e.g. from VM A to VM B in . In this case some embodiments nevertheless perform the full processing pipeline as the actual forwarding decisions occur at the 2L level. In such a case the source managed switching element would identify the ingress ports at the 1L and 2L level in exactly the same manner as described above for . The forwarding lookups would still identify an 2L egress port which would in turn map to a 1L egress port. The difference in this case is that the 1L egress port would not be the port for remotely destined packets but rather a port that maps to one of the machines in the 1L domain. As such the packet would generally not reach the interconnection switching element but instead would travel through the local network to the destination switching element which would remove all of the encapsulation and send the packet to the destination machine.

As indicated above describes a generic processing pipeline. illustrates a processing pipeline for a specific type of network performing OSI layer 2 forwarding e.g. forwarding based on MAC address . The pipeline is the same as the pipeline except that the forwarding lookups stage is split into three stages . Each of these stages involves a separate forwarding table lookup as shown in the forwarding tables of the managed switching element .

The ingress ACL stage uses the 2L logical ingress port as well as other fields stored in the packet header e.g. MAC address identifier of the 2L logical switching element etc. to make a decision about how to proceed with the packet. Some ACL operations include allowing the packet to continue with further processing denying the packet which will cause the switching element to discard the packet and cease further processing and enqueuing the packet e.g. sending the packet to a queue for Quality of Service purposes . The ACL tables may implement other functionalities as well such as counters i.e. counting the number of packets coming from a particular source address or to a destination address port security i.e. only allowing packets coming in through a particular port that originated at a particular machine and machine isolation i.e. only sending broadcast multicast packets received from a particular machine to a particular set of machines .

The layer 2 logical forwarding stage performs the actual forwarding lookup that determines the logical 2L egress port for the packet. As this switching element is performing layer 2 forwarding the forwarding table record bases the decision on the destination MAC address of the packet in some embodiments. Other embodiments performing layer 3 routing might make a forwarding decision based on the destination IP address of the packet.

The third stage of the processing pipeline performed at the second logical level is the egress ACL stage . In general the egress ACL forwarding table records may include the same operations e.g. allow deny enqueue etc. as the ingress ACL forwarding table records but are based on egress port information or a combination of ingress and egress port information. Some embodiments will only have either an ingress ACL table or an egress ACL table while other embodiments include both tables. In addition some embodiments may split forwarding or ACL tables into multiple tables. In some embodiments depending on the nature of the ACL rules the number of resulting lookup entries may be decreased when what could be treated as a single table is split up into several tables. For instance certain more complicated ACL rules may benefit from such a split of the lookup entries into several tables.

Both and illustrate the switching element repeatedly sending packets to a dispatch port effectively resubmitting the packet back into the switching element. In some embodiments using software switching elements provides the ability to perform such resubmissions of packets. Whereas hardware switching elements generally involve a fixed pipeline due in part to the use of an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform the processing software switching elements of some embodiments can extend a packet processing pipeline as long as necessary as there is not much of a delay from performing the resubmissions. In addition some embodiments enable optimization of the multiple lookups for subsequent packets within a single set of related packets e.g. a single TCP UDP flow . When the first packet arrives the managed switching element performs all of the lookups and resubmits e.g. the 8 forwarding table records illustrated in in order to fully process the packet. The switching element then caches the end result of the decision in the above case the addition of the particular 2L and 1L egress contexts to the packet and the next hop forwarding decision out a particular port over a particular tunnel along with a unique identifier for the packet that will be shared with all other related packets i.e. a unique identifier for the TCP UDP flow . Some embodiments push this cached result into the kernel of the switching element for additional optimization. For additional packets that share the unique identifier i.e. additional packets within the same flow the switching element can use the single cached lookup that specifies all of the actions to perform on the packet. Once the flow of packets is complete e.g. after a particular amount of time with no such packets in some embodiments the switching element flushes the cache.

The above examples illustrate various cases in which two first level domains i.e. first level logical datapath sets are interconnected via a second level logical datapath set. However this is not the only situation in which a network operator may use multiple levels of hierarchical logical datapath sets. For example there might be more than two first level domains that are all connected by a second level logical datapath set more than two levels of logical datapath sets or even one first level logical datapath set split into several second level logical datapath sets.

In this case the interconnecting managed switching elements form a full mesh. That is the switching element at the first data center connects to the switching element at the second data center and the switching element at the third data center through the external network without having to go through one of the other data centers. In addition the managed switching element connects to the switching element through the external network without traveling through the data center .

In addition the network includes a second level controller cluster . This controller cluster connects to first level controller clusters and at the three different data centers. In this case the second level controller is shown as situated outside of any of the data centers but as with the second level controllers in the controller may be situated in one of the data centers or all three domains could be in a single data center with the second level controller in some embodiments.

The various arrows shown in represent ingress and egress context mappings performed by forwarding tables of managed switching elements implementing the logical switching elements while processing packets. For instance a first arrow between Port of the 1L LDPS and the 2L LDPS indicates that switching elements may perform both ingress mappings from 1L ingress port to 2L ingress port and egress mappings from 2L egress port to 1L egress port between these two ports. On the other hand the unidirectional arrows and indicate that switching elements may perform egress context mappings from Port of 2L LDPS to either Port of 1L LDPS or Port of 1L LDPS but do not perform ingress mappings from the 1L LDPS ports facing external networks to 2L ports. Packets only originate at these ports from the perspective of the 1L logical switching element for packets incoming from other domains but not from the 2L perspective from the 2L perspective the packets always originate at a source machine .

In some embodiments machines on the 2L network may wish to send broadcast packets to all other machines in the network. However such a setup can create a problem of having broadcast multicast packets circulate in an infinite loop. For example if VM A sends a broadcast packet the source hypervisor will identify Port as the logical ingress port for both the 1L logical switching element and then the 2L logical switching element . As this is a broadcast packet the egress ports identified by the forwarding tables are Ports of logical switching element . However three of these egress ports Ports map to Port of the 1L logical switching element and three of the ports Ports map to Port of the 1L logical switching element so essentially the packet is broadcast to each of the 1L ports two of which connect to remote data centers. When such a broadcast packet reaches the remote 1L logical switching element via Port this logical switching element will broadcast the packet to all of its other ports including Port . Sending the packet to Port of logical switching element will cause the packet to travel to Port of the logical switching element which will in turn broadcast the packet to all of its ports including Port . This sends the broadcast packet to Port of the originating logical switching element which broadcasts it to all of its ports. In this way two infinite loops are created with packets traveling between the networks in both directions. With additional 1L domains the problem can become even worse.

Accordingly different embodiments use different solutions to prevent such an infinite replication issue. For instance some embodiments flag incoming broadcast packets to prevent such an infinite replication issue. conceptually illustrate processes of some embodiments for implementing such a flag to prevent broadcast replication.

The process determines at whether the source of the packet is a machine from a remote first level logical datapath set. This may be accomplished by checking the header of the packet in some embodiments. Other embodiments instead use the physical interface of the interconnecting switching element at which the packet was received i.e. determine whether the packet was received at a port that faces an external network.

When the packet source is a remote machine the process sets at a flag in the packet to indicate the remote source. Some embodiments use a single bit e.g. a default value of 0 and a value of 1 for remote source packets . The process then forwards at the packet towards one or more destination ports of the first level logical datapath set. While this process indicates the determination of whether a packet is a remote source as applied to all packets received at the managed switching element implementing the process some embodiments do not apply a test to all packets received at the switching element. Instead upon receiving a packet on a port that faces an external network the switching element automatically applies the remote source flag to the packet.

The process determines at whether the packet is flagged as having a source in a remote first level logical switching element. As indicated above this flag may be a single bit that has been set by either the current or a previous managed switching element in order to prevent infinite replication of broadcast packets in a federated network.

When the packet is flagged as such the process broadcasts at the packet only to local machines connected to the first level logical switching element. That is in the example of a broadcast packet received on Port of the 1L LDPS with such a flag bit set would only be sent to Ports of the 1L LDPS. On the other hand when the packet is not flagged e.g. if the packet is received from a machine local to the 1L logical switching element the process broadcasts at the packet to all ports of the first level logical switching element. The process then ends.

This combination of processes will prevent the infinite replication problem without over suppressing packets in the fully connected network such as is shown in . However in some embodiments the various 1L domains may not be fully connected. That is packets originating in a first domain with a destination in a second domain may need to travel through a third domain. conceptually illustrates such a network . In this case the first data center and the third data center do not have a direct connection. Instead a packet traveling from the first data center to the third data center would need to travel through the second domain . In this case the processes shown in will prevent broadcast packets from one of the outer domains 1L networks and from reaching the other one of the outer domain. As such some embodiments use a time to live TTL or other hop counter to prevent the infinite replication problem. That is each packet can only be replicated either a particular number of times or for a particular time period before the packet is dropped.

While all of the previous examples illustrate two levels of hierarchical logical switching elements the principles involved in mapping between logical ingress and egress ports of the different logical levels may be applied ad infinitum restricted of course by packet sizes limits of switch forwarding tables and practicality . illustrates a network with four data centers with three levels of network controller clusters. Specifically the network includes a first 1L domain a second 1L domain a third 1L domain and a fourth 1L domain . The first 1L domain and the third 1L domain together form a first 2L domain controlled by a first 2L controller cluster which may be located at one of the data centers or external to both as shown . The second 1L domain and the fourth 1L domain together form a second 2L domain controlled by a second 2L controller cluster which may be located at one of the data centers or external to both as shown . Finally the two 2L controller clusters are controlled by a 3L controller cluster from which flow entries originate in the network . Flow entries originate at the controller cluster e.g. in response to user input detection of a new end machine etc. and are pushed down to the 2L controller clusters and then from these controllers to the 1L controller clusters and from there to the managed switching elements.

As shown the first 1L domain and the third 1L domain includes three VMs each while the second 1L domain and the fourth 1L domain include two VMs each. conceptually illustrates the three levels of logical switching elements implemented for the network as well as some of the mappings between the ports of these logical switching elements.

The first 1L logical switching element includes three ports for the three VMs in this domain as well as a fourth port for packets sent to and received from the other 1L domain within its 2L group data center and a fifth port for packets sent to and received from the other 2L domain irrespective of which 1L domain within the other 2L domain . The other three 1L logical switching elements and have similar port arrangements. Some embodiments however include separate ports for each 1L domain in other 2L domains. In this case the 1L logical switching element would include six logical ports as Port would be split into two ports one for each of the 1L domains and .

The first 2L logical switching element includes six ports for the six VMs in this domain as well as a seventh port for packets sent to and received from the other 2L domain. The other 2L logical switching element includes a similar port arrangement though with only five ports rather than seven. Finally the 3L logical switching element includes ten ports one for each of the VMs in the network. While this illustrates a three level hierarchy in some embodiments the 3L logical switching element could have a port for packets sent to and received from another 3L domain connected together via an 4L logical switching element.

This figure also illustrates some of the ingress and egress context mappings performed by the managed switching elements of the network according to flow instructions received from the network controllers with ingress mappings flowing from lower levels to higher levels and egress mappings flowing in the opposite direction. For instance the arrows and indicates that packets sent from VM will be mapped ingress from Port of the 1L logical switching element to Port of the 2L logical switching element and then to Port of the 3L logical switching element and in the opposite direction for egress mapping of packets directed towards VM once within the domain of the respective switching elements. For packets directed from one of the VMs or within the domain of the 1L logical switching element to VM or one of VMs and packets will be egress mapped at the source managed switching element to Port of the logical switching element . For packets originating at a VM on the 1L logical switching element directed towards one of VMs or the source managed switching element will map the egress port of the 3L logical switching element one of Ports to Port of the 2L logical switching element and then to Port of the 1L logical switching element as shown by arrows and .

In the federated network examples illustrated above multiple first level logical datapath sets are connected together via a single second level logical datapath set. However in some situations a single first level logical datapath set might be sliced into several logical datapath sets at the second level. As one example a service provider might host numerous users e.g. tenants on its network of virtual machines exposing a single logical datapath set for each user. However if a user has multiple departments each with their own set of virtual machines and wants to give these departments separate control of their machines then some embodiments allow the first level datapath to be sliced into multiple second level datapaths. In some embodiments this slicing may be accomplished using mechanisms present in the more standard federated case e.g. by matching a particular ingress port of an 1L LDPS to a particular ingress port of a particular 2L LDPS. As will be described the difference in this case is that different ingress ports on the same 1L LDPS will match to different 2L LDPS.

In some embodiments enabling the 1L logical datapath set to be used as a platform for multiple 2L logical datapath sets requires similar techniques to the use of multiple 1L LDPS on a physical network. That is just as the 1L flows require ingress context matching to identify that a particular physical machine belongs to a particular 1L LDPS the 2L flows require ingress context matching to identify that a particular port of an 1L LDPS belongs to a particular 2L LDPS as opposed to other 2L LDPS. This requires that the 1L LDPS has to support such matching in its logical pipeline abstraction.

For a typical single level i.e. non federated logical network in some embodiments the packet processing in the 1L LDPS s operations requires matching over packet headers as well as the slice. Therefore the physical switching element needs to support matching over a 1L LDPS slice context ID and packet headers. In general implementing a second level logical datapath set on top of this requires the physical switching element to support matching over the 1L LDPS slice context ID a 2L slice context ID and the packet headers. This can be implemented as a nested structure with each 1L LDPS slice holding a set of 2L LDPS slices.

In the runtime packet processing initially there is no slicing. When a managed switching element receives a packet the switching element initially identifies the first slice 1L LDPS . In some embodiments the switching element loads the 1L LDPS context slice id into a register and scopes subsequent matches into the 1L LDPS. While doing this the switching element removes the frontmost encapsulation header and saves any information into a register for the 1L LDPS. The 1L LDPS then proceeds to its logical lookup tables though there may be additional lookups at this level not discussed above . These lookups identify the 2L LDPS and save this result into another register in some embodiments. In addition the managed switching element removes the frontmost encapsulation header and saves any information into a register for the 2L LDPS. Next the matches are scoped into the 1L and 2L LDPS. After the various 2L LDPS lookups e.g. ACL tables forwarding etc. are complete the packet begins traversing back towards the physical once 2L LDPS processing finishes the managed switching element saves its forwarding decision into a packet header by adding a new encapsulation. Similarly once the 1L LDPS processing finishes the switching element saves this result into the header by adding an encapsulation to the front of packet.

The above section describes the interconnection of managed networks e.g. networks such as those described in Section I . In some cases however a network manager will want to provide connections between a first network segmented using a first tagging or tunneling technique e.g. VLAN Mac in Mac L2 over L3 MPLS etc. and a second network segmented using a second tagging or tunneling technique. Even when the two networks use the same technique e.g. both networks use VLANs the implementation of that technique e.g. the structure of the tags used in packet headers may be different between the two networks such that they are effectively using two different techniques.

Some embodiments provide a mechanism for connecting such disparate networks across a common interconnecting network e.g. an L3 network that can forward traffic between the disparate networks. To connect such networks some embodiments use a single managed interconnection switching element e.g. an extender at the edge of each of the segmented networks then manage these interconnection switching elements with a network controller cluster that defines a logical datapath set between the sites.

These three separate networks could be all owned and operated completely independently without requiring any interconnection. However the owner s of either the physical networks or the virtual machines on the networks might wish for their machines to have the ability to communicate with each other. For instance if a first organization that owns the segmented network and uses a first type of VLAN tagging merges with a second organization that owns the segmented network the merged organization might want their IT departments e.g. VLAN and VLAN to be able to communicate as though all the machines were on a single L2 network.

In order to enable communication between network segments at different locations some embodiments locate an interconnection switching element such as an extender at the edge of each of the segmented networks then manage these interconnection switching elements with a network controller cluster. conceptually illustrates such a solution for the networks . This figure illustrates that three interconnection managed switching elements and have been located at the edges of the three segmented networks .

The three interconnecting managed switching elements are managed by a network controller cluster which may be a single network controller or several controllers that share information. This controller cluster is similar to those described above e.g. with a control application and virtualization application . However where the ports of the logical switching element defined by a network controller instance or face end machines either virtual or physical the ports of the logical switching element defined by the controller face network segments e.g. a particular VLAN at a particular site .

The decoding information along with additional information e.g. the port on which a packet arrived enables the managed interconnection switching element to determine the logical context of a packet exiting the local segmented network i.e. the segmented network at the edge of which the switching element is located . In this situation the decoding information stores information regarding the VLAN context tag information which allows the interconnection switching element to identify a packet as originating at a machine in VLAN . In some embodiments this decoding information also specifies how to add VLAN information for packets incoming to network from a remote network and destined for a machine on VLAN .

The logical forwarding information implements the logical switching element enabling the switching element to perform logical forwarding decisions between the different networks on the logical switching element. As shown the information includes lists of destination addresses for the different segmented networks connected to the logical switching element . The switching element uses this information to identify a logical port to which a packet should be forwarded by identifying the destination address in one of the lists . In addition any ACL tables for implementing security policy are contained within the logical forwarding tables .

Finally the switching element stores egress mapping and delivery tables which specifies how a packet with a given logical destination e.g. VLAN is delivered to a next hop. This information includes tunnel information e.g. specifying tunnels defined across the interconnecting network between the different managed switching elements as well as physical port mapping information to identify the physical port of the switching element through which an outgoing packet should be sent.

Just as the physical switching elements in a data center may implement several logical switching elements simultaneously e.g. between different users VMs the physical managed switching elements interconnecting different segments of networks may also implement several logical switching elements. illustrates a scenario for the networks in which two different network controllers and generate flow entries for two different logical networks and push the flows to the same switching elements . As shown in this case both of the controllers connect to all three switching elements but in some embodiments a first network controller cluster might control first second and third switching elements at the edges of first second and third networks while a second network controller cluster controls the first switching element as well as a fourth switching element at the edge of a fourth network or other similar possibilities.

Finally the egress mapping and delivery tables includes some overlapping information used for transmitting packets on either of the two logical switching elements in some embodiments. For instance packets may use the same tunnels between the physical switching elements irrespective of to which logical switching element the packet is assigned.

The above examples illustrate a situation in which several segmented networks are connected at a single logical layer. That is a single logical switching element is defined by a network controller cluster and this logical switching element contains a single port for each of the network segments. In some embodiments the principles described above in Section II for hierarchically arranging networks using multiple levels of controller clusters and logical datapath sets can be applied to the problem of interconnecting several segmented networks.

In this example however there is no single controller cluster that connects to each of the physical switching elements to generate the flows for those switching elements. Instead the first and second switching elements and are controlled by a first first level controller cluster and the third and fourth switching elements and are controlled by a second first level controller cluster . As such a first logical switching element routes packets between machines on VLAN and machines on VLAN while a second logical switching element routes packets between machines on VLAN and machines on VLAN .

In addition the provider of the interconnecting services e.g. the owner of the four networks being interconnected may want the ability to connect all four of the VLANs together. As such a second level controller cluster is introduced in order to handle connect the two logical datapath sets defined by the first level controllers. As in the case of federation between managed networks described above the second level controller cluster generates flow entries defining the second level logical switching element that are passed down to the two first level controller clusters and which generate their own flow entries that implement the flows received from the second level controller cluster and pass these flows to their respective managed interconnection switching elements.

This second interconnection model applying the federated network concept to the interconnecting switching elements enables more robust traffic engineering. While not necessarily as important in the illustrated example with only four total networks being connected the hierarchical approach enables more intelligent traffic engineering especially in larger scale scenarios. In the single level model a full mesh of tunnels between the managed switching elements are defined and this requires a reliable connectivity for each such connection. Especially as the number of networks being connected increases and the networks move further apart physically this may result in overprovisioning of the network capacity. Furthermore as the packets are encapsulated in these tunnels traffic engineering to enforce policies is difficult. To perform such engineering the intermediate switching elements would need to look inside the encapsulation in order to make decisions.

In the hierarchical approach the second level network controller cluster receives traffic engineering policies from user settings and uses optimization routines combined with network statistics received from the lower level controllers. In some embodiments the lower level controllers automatically collect information regarding their respective regions of the interconnecting network i.e. from the switching elements implementing their lower level logical datapath set and pass this information upward to the second level network controller. In some embodiments these statistics relate to the number of packets being sent out and received at various ports of the managed switching elements the travel time of the packets along different paths etc.

Irrespective of whether any specific policies have been set by users the second level controller uses the statistics as an input into an optimization routine that determines in which direction traffic should be routed. For example a packet sent from a machine at a network segment on a first 1L logical datapath set to a machine at a network segment on a second 1L logical datapath set might have several different paths it could take to arrive at the second 1L logical datapath set. Based on the network statistics the second level controller determines an optimal one of these several different paths which might travel through different sets of intervening 1L logical datapath sets for packets to travel along from the first to the second 1L logical datapath set.

The optimization routine may also be affected by user settings in some embodiments. The user settings might specify that a certain quality of service QoS is required for packets sent from a particular machine from a particular network segment to a particular destination machine or network segment etc. User settings can also specify that either packets from to a particular source destination should always be sent along a particular path overriding the optimization processing or should always receive the best connection. The user can specify different classes of traffic as well. For packets either given a lower class or not addressed i.e. with no guaranteed QoS the optimization routines of some embodiments attempt to send the packets over the best connection without interrupting higher class traffic.

In a single level interconnected network of some embodiments flow entries are generated by the network controller and pushed down to the managed switching elements as would be the case in a typical managed network within a data center. That is a network controller of some embodiments includes i a control application that receives logical control plane data and converts this to logical forwarding plane data and ii a virtualization application that receives logical forwarding plane data and converts this to physical control plane data which is pushed to the managed interconnection switching elements. In some embodiments each of these sets of data logical control plane logical forwarding plane physical control plane are stored in the network controller as n Log tables and the control and virtualization applications perform n Log table mapping operations to convert from one data plane to the next using an n Log rules engine. In some embodiments in fact the control application and virtualization application use the same rules engine to perform their table mappings. As mentioned previously the network controller of some embodiments is described in greater detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 177 533 incorporated by reference above.

However some differences do emerge to account for the fact that the logical ports correspond to network segments which may have numerous associated addresses rather than single machines. When a new VM is added or moved within a network some embodiments require new logical flow entries while other embodiments do not. This situation is described in subsection D below regarding learning in the interconnected network of some embodiments.

When a user specifies that a new network segment be added to the interconnected network the control application receives an event that a particular segment is at a new logical port Port Y . This event is analogous to the addition of a new machine in a typical managed network such as is described above in Section I. The control application then translates this event into an update to the logical lookup table that instructs a switching element to forward a packet to the new logical Port Y when the packet destination matches with the new network segment i.e. when the destination address belongs to the particular network segment . The virtualization application then generates a physical forwarding plane lookup that adds another layer of matching. This new lookup states that if the 2L logical datapath set is matched i.e. the source network segment is on the logical switching element and that the destination address matches the new network segment then the packet should be forwarded to the new logical Port Y. The virtualization application then pushes this lookup entry to the different interconnection switching elements.

The process then determines at whether the update to the logical control plane requires the creation of new flow entries. For instance if the update simply indicates that the network state has not changed then no new entries are required and the process ends. On the other hand if the update specifies new ACL rules or indicates the attachment of a new network segment to the network then the network controller will begin generating new flow entries. In addition as described below different embodiments use different learning models to distribute the MAC addresses associated with each port as each port will have several possible destination MAC addresses .

Next when the update requires new entries the process translates at the logical control plane update into an update to the lookups in the logical forwarding plane. In some embodiments this translation involves turning a piece of data into a lookup entry. For instance if a new network segment VLAN Q is attached to a logical Port Z of the logical switching element for the interconnecting network then the logical control plane states VLAN Q is at Port Z . Using tables that list the MAC addresses associated with VLAN Q the control application translates this update into an update to the logical forwarding plane lookup table that reads If destination matches MAC A Forward to Port Z . In this case A is the set of MAC addresses associated with VLAN Q. Some embodiments create this forwarding plane lookup as a separate entries for each MAC address in the set A

In addition as with the multi level network described above the generation of ACL table entries will also be described. As with the entries in Section II the conversions tend to be feature agnostic again primarily involving the addition of match conditions . Thus at the logical control plane the user specifies that the Port Z should be secured that is that network data entering and exiting the logical switching element through the particular port have only certain addresses that the switching element has restricted the port to use. However these entries differ somewhat from the example given for the federated network above because each port will have numerous MAC addresses IP addresses with which it is associated. For example if a particular VLAN has 1000 machines running on it then the port security entry for that VLAN will need to include 1000 different MAC addresses and IP addresses as allowed. For instance the logical forwarding plane entry for the ingress ACL will state If received from Ingress Port Z Allow or Drop If ARP MAC not A or IP not B or Drop If MAC not A or IP not B. In this case A is the set of MAC addresses associated with VLAN Q as stated above and B is the set of IP addresses at VLAN Q. The egress ACL lookup prevents packets not sent to a correct address from exiting the switching element at Port Z onto the VLAN Q with an instruction of If sent to Egress Port Z Drop If dest. IP not B . This prevents other IP addresses from being used within the VLAN Q by the nature of the logical forwarding packets sent to MAC addresses not in the set A will not be directed to Port Z in the first place. In addition some embodiments also mandate a match of the MAC address to the IP address in the egress ACL entry. That is the entry requires that If sent to Egress Port Z and match MAC A Drop If dest. IP not B where Aand Bare matching MAC and IP addresses. This ensures that a first VM within the VLAN Q does not use the IP address of a different VM within the same VLAN.

After translating the logical control plane update into logical forwarding plane lookups the process then translates at the logical forwarding plane data into physical control plane lookups. As with the logical control plane to logical forwarding plane translation in some embodiments the conversion from logical forwarding plane to physical control plane is performed as an n Log table mapping operation e.g. using the same table mapping engine as for the logical control plane to logical forwarding plane operation . For both the ACL lookups and the attachment of a new machine the virtualization application adds a match of the logical datapath set to the entry. These conversions are the same as for a single level network within a datacenter. Thus the first entry to attach a new VLAN Q now states If match LDPS and If destination matches MAC A Forward to Port Z . Similarly the ingress ACL entry reads If match LDPS and If received from Ingress Port Z Allow or Drop If ARP MAC not A or IP not B or Drop If MAC not A or IP not B and the egress ACL reads If match LDPS and If sent to Egress Port Z Drop If dest. IP not B .

In addition to translating the logical forwarding lookups to physical control plane lookups the process also generates at additional physical control plane entries in order to realize the logical forwarding plane over the physical network. In some embodiments the virtualization application rules engine creates additional flow entries to handle the operations around the forwarding lookups. As described in the federating case these lookups include ingress port integration egress port integration and tunnel sending and receiving entries.

In some embodiments these lookups are generated as soon as the new network segment e.g. VLAN Q is added to the interconnecting network at a particular physical port. When ACL entries are subsequently generated for the particular port these additional physical control plane entries are not affected. For the sake of the ongoing example the physical port to which the network containing VLAN Q connects is Port W of the extender located at the edge of the segmented network. For this example the ingress port integration entry matches the physical Port W and the VLAN Q to the logical ingress port Z. Thus this entry states If received from physical ingress Port W and match VLAN Q Mark logical ingress as Port Z . The additional match over VLAN Q enables the interconnection switching element to differentiate between several network segments located on the same network based on the segment context headers identified in the packet.

The egress port integration entry matches the forwarding decision at the logical level to a physical port. Specifically the virtualization application generates an entry that states If sent to Port Z Run through egress pipeline then send to Port W . As for the flows described in Section II these entries are sent to the managed interconnection switching element to which VLAN Q connects. However for a packet to be sent out onto VLAN Q the interconnection switching element will also need to append the VLAN context tag. Accordingly some embodiments modify the egress port integration lookup to send to the particular interconnection switching element so that the lookup states If sent to Port Z Run through egress pipeline then append VLAN Q context then send to Port W . In other embodiments the appending of the network segment context is specified in a separate lookup entry.

In addition as with the federated network described above some embodiments also generate lookups to handle the receipt and transmission of packets across the different interconnection switching elements. In the full mesh case there is a separate tunnel between each pair of interconnection switching elements and thus the only interconnection switching element that receives a packet for a tunnel is the interconnection switching element at the destination network for the packet. Thus the other interconnection switching elements get a physical control plane lookup of If sent to Port Z Encapsulate with Z s context ID and output to physical port via tunnel that connects to destination switch . For the receiving side of the tunnel at the managed switching element that contains Port W the virtualization application generates a tunnel decapsulation lookup entry that states If tunneled Decapsulate to identify logical port then Resubmit . The resubmission results in the execution of the egress port integration described above.

With all of the physical control plane entries generated the process identifies at the managed switching elements to receive the generated lookups. As described for some of the various lookup entries generated at and not all of the managed interconnection switching elements will receive every lookup. For example the tunnel sending lookups will not be sent to the managed switching element to which the network segment actually connects while the tunnel receiving and port integration lookups are only sent to that managed switching element. Furthermore except in the rare situation that two of the network segments on the same logical switching element are also in the same segmented network e.g. VLAN and VLAN of a particular VLAN segmented network the actual forwarding lookups will not need to be sent to the interconnection switching element to which the destination network segment is connected.

Finally the process pushes at the generated flow entries to the identified interconnection switching elements then ends. In some embodiments the network controller communicates directly with the managed interconnection switching elements. However in other embodiments the network controller that performs the conversion of the logical forwarding plane data into the physical control plane data sends physical control plane data to master controllers for the particular interconnection switching elements that are to receive the data and these master controllers push the data to the switching elements. In addition while this example describes the computation of physical control plane data customized for particular switching elements e.g. with port numbers of the particular switching elements some embodiments compute universal physical control plane data that is generic to any particular switching element. In this case either the master controller or a chassis controller at the managed interconnection switching element performs the conversion to customized physical control plane data for the managed switching elements. In some embodiments the 1L controller propagates the generated flow entries e.g. to the master controller from the master controller to the managed switching elements through an object oriented NIB data structure while other embodiments use direct communication channels e.g. RPC calls OpenFlow entries updates over the configuration protocol to exchange the flow entries.

The API provides an interface for translating input into the control plane input tables . This API may be used by various types of management tools with which the user can view and or modify the state of a logical network in this case network for interconnecting network segments . In some embodiments the management tools provide a user interface such as a graphical user interface that allows a visual configuration of port bindings ACL rules etc. e.g. through a web browser . Alternatively or in conjunction with the graphical user interface some embodiments provide the user with a command line tool or other type of user interface.

Based on the information received through the API as well as updates to the network state received from the managed switching elements not shown the control application generates the input tables . The input tables represent the state of the logical switching elements managed by the user in some embodiments. As shown in this figure some of the input tables include the association of sets of MAC addresses IP addresses that are part of a particular network segment with logical ports of the logical switching element as well as ACL rules set by the user. In this case the Port Z is associated with VLAN Q which includes the MAC addresses A and IP addresses B and is secured. In some embodiments the input tables also include information on the context tags e.g. for VLAN Q .

The rules engine of some embodiments performs various combinations of database operations on different sets of input tables to populate and or modify different sets of output tables . As described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 288 908 incorporated by reference above in some embodiments the rules engine is an n Log table mapping engine that maps a first set of n Log tables into a second set of n Log tables. The output tables populated by the rules engine of the control application include logical forwarding plane lookups e.g. mapping a set of MAC address to a destination output port and logical forwarding plane ACL entries e.g. securing Port X .

The publisher is also described in further detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 288 908 and publishes or sends the output tables to the virtualization application in order for the virtualization application to use the output tables among its input tables. In some embodiments the publisher also outputs the tables to an object oriented data structure NIB that stores network state information.

The virtualization application receives the output tables of the control application and converts this logical forwarding plane data to physical control plane data to be sent to the managed interconnection switching elements. As shown the 2L virtualization application includes a subscriber input tables a rules engine output tables and a publisher . The subscriber of some embodiments is responsible for retrieving tables published by the publisher of the control application . In some embodiments the subscriber retrieves these tables from the same object oriented data structure to which the publisher stores the table information. In other embodiments a change in the tables is detected by the virtualization application in order to initiate the processing.

The input tables include in some embodiments at least some of the output tables in addition to other tables. As shown in addition to the logical forwarding plane data generated by the control application the input tables include additional port binding information matching logical ports with physical ports of particular managed interconnection switching elements . In addition some embodiments include tunnel information that describes the tunnels between the various interconnection switching elements e.g. extenders . In some embodiments additional pathway information is not needed because the interconnection switching elements form a full mesh.

In some embodiments the rules engine is the same as the rules engine . That is the control application and the virtualization application actually use the same rules engine in some embodiments. As indicated the rules engine performs various combinations of database operations on different sets of input tables to populate and or modify different sets of output tables . In some embodiments the rules engine is an n Log table mapping engine that maps a first set of n Log tables into a second set of n Log tables. The output tables populated by the rules engine include physical control plane lookups e.g. mapping a set of MAC Addresses to a destination logical port when the LDPS is matched and physical control plane ACL entries e.g. securing Port X . In addition the ingress and egress port integration and tunnel sending receiving lookups are generated by the rules engine in some embodiments. In addition to the information shown in the figure some embodiments also include in the output tables the correct managed switching elements to receive the different tables.

Finally the publisher is similar to the publisher in some embodiments. The publisher publishes and or sends the output tables to the managed interconnection switching elements that implement the logical network between network segments. In some embodiments these managed interconnection switching elements are all extenders though in other embodiments other types of managed switching elements may be included e.g. pool nodes . In some embodiments the publisher outputs the tables to an object oriented data structure NIB that stores network state information.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the input and output tables shown in this figure are simplified conceptual representations of the actual tables which are generated in a database language appropriate for the rules engine e.g. n Log and may provide additional information to that shown. Furthermore different embodiments will use different sets of tables. For instance the logical port address and port binding tables of some embodiments are actually a single table that binds a particular set of MAC and IP addresses in a network segment behind a particular physical port of a particular extender to a particular logical port.

The foregoing discussion in this section related to the flat full mesh interconnection network. As indicated however some embodiments apply the principles of federated networks to the interconnecting network. In such a scenario the flow generation processes take place at multiple levels of controllers as described in Section II above. In addition the modifications related to having numerous destination MAC addresses at each of the logical ports and the need to remove add network segment context tags will be accounted for. Thus the control plane at the 2L network controller will state that a particular network segment binds to a particular 2L port and a particular 1L port. The forwarding lookups are generated as described above from the 2L controller to the 1L controller resulting in a physical control plane lookup of If match 1L LDPS and if match 2L LDPS and if destination matches Network Segment Forward to 2L Port . In addition the 2L controller generates entries for 1L 2L port mapping and for the tunnels between the 1L domains. Similarly each 1L controller generates entries for physical 1L port mapping and the tunnels within its 1L domain.

In some embodiments the pathways between 1L domains are determined by the 2L network controller. For instance a machine in a first network segment located in a first domain might send a packet to a machine in a second network segment located in a second domain that does not have a direct connection to the first domain i.e. there is no tunnel defined between any extender in the first domain and any extender in the second domain . In addition in some situations multiple possible paths through the 1L domains are possible in order for the packet to reach its destination. For example the packet might be able to travel either through a third domain or a combination of a fourth domain and a fifth domain.

The determination as to which of these different pathways through the interconnected network a packet should travel is determined by the 2L network controller. In some embodiments the 2L network controller performs optimization processing in order to generate input tables that specify the optimized pathways. The virtualization application in the 2L network controller can then use these optimized pathways to generate the appropriate tunneling lookups to send packets along the correct path through the network.

As shown in some embodiments the pathway optimizer receives user defined policies from a user interface . In some embodiments the user interface is the same user interface through which input tables to the control application are generated. The user interface may be a graphical user interface a command line interface or other mechanism for allowing the user to input pathway data. Through the user interface the user may input various policies. For instance the user settings might specify that a certain quality of service QoS is required for packets sent from a particular machine from a particular network segment to a particular destination machine or network segment etc. User settings can also specify that packets to from a particular source destination should always be sent along a particular path overriding the optimization processing or should always receive the best connection. The user can specify different classes of traffic as well e.g. high priority medium priority low priority which has the effect of treating the packets differently from a QoS perspective.

In addition the pathway optimizer receives a traffic matrix from the lower level controllers collectively represented as box . The traffic matrix contains statistics regarding network data within and between the various 1L domains. In various embodiments this traffic matrix contains various information regarding the number of packets being sent out and received at various ports of the managed switching elements of the 1L networks the travel time of the packets along various paths within and between domains etc. In some embodiments this data is collected by the various managed switching elements and then retrieved by the 1L network controllers e.g. by querying the managed switching elements . The 1L network controllers may perform some processing on the data first or pass the raw data directly to the higher level network controllers for use in the pathway optimizer. Some embodiments collect the network statistics on a regular basis e.g. every hour every four hours etc. in order to regularly update the pathways through the network and keep the pathways optimized.

The pathway optimizer generates a set of optimized paths which may be used as an input table by the logical forwarding plane of the higher level controller in order to determine optimized pathways through the domain. Various different optimization algorithms are used by different embodiments such as simulated annealing etc. The optimizer uses the policies as constraints and determines the best set of pathways given the traffic matrix . The most important packets highest QoS are given the best pathways while the optimizer attempts to additionally optimize the lowest QoS packets as well without harming the high QoS packets. These optimized paths are output for use by the virtualization application for generating lookup entries for the lower level logical forwarding plane.

While the above section describes the generation of forwarding table entries for the interconnecting managed switching elements in a network that interconnects network segments at different network sites the following section will describe the processing of packets by those managed switching elements using the generated flows. The subsections will describe the processing of packets by managed switching elements in both a full mesh interconnecting network with a single logical datapath set and a hierarchical logical network with multiple levels of logical datapath sets.

As shown the packet originates from a source machine in a network segment with a payload headers and segment information . The payload contains the actual data intended for the destination machine while the headers include information appended by the source machine in order to enable the packet to reach the destination machine. For instance the headers might include the source and destination machines physical addresses e.g. MAC addresses and or network addresses e.g. IP addresses .

The segment information is a context tag in some embodiments that indicates the local network segment of the source machine. This segment information may be a VLAN tag MPLS header MAC in MAC header etc. In some embodiments one or more of the network segments may be a managed network such as those shown in Section I and the segment info is a logical context tag for the network.

The packet is sent from the source machine through its local network in most cases through one or more switching elements within the local network . The local network switching elements will have learned that packets sent to the destination address in the packet header should be forwarded to the local interconnection switching element . In some embodiments the segment info includes a destination address field with an indicator for remote destinations that the local switching elements recognize causing them to forward the packet to the local interconnection switching element .

As shown the local interconnection switching element e.g. an extender at the edge of the local segmented network that faces the external interconnecting network first removes the local context tag information i.e. the segment info . In some embodiments the interconnection switching element uses the decoding information for the local segmented network stored in its tables. The switching element then executes the logical flow for the interconnection network in which it adds logical egress information to the packet .

As shown the process begins by receiving at a packet with a destination external to the local segmented network at the physical ingress port facing the local segmented network. A switching element whether managed or unmanaged has several physical ports through which packets may enter or exit. In general each port can serve as both an ingress port for packets entering the switching element and an egress port for packets exiting the switching element although in some embodiments certain ports may be reserved for either ingress or egress specifically. In general the extender or other interconnection switching element will have a single port that connects to the local segmented network though the switching element could have several such ports in some embodiments.

The process then removes at the local network segment tagging. As stated the network segment context tag may be a VLAN tag MPLS label MAC in MAC header etc. depending on the segmenting technique used by the local network. The switching element uses its decoding information to identify the local context tag portion of the packet in some embodiments. That is the decoding information specifies which bits of a packet will have the local context tag and what each bit within the context tag means. As such the switching element will not only remove the context tag but can store any relevant information in its registers e.g. the specific VLAN on which the source machine resides .

Next the process determines at the logical ingress port of the packet based on the physical ingress port and the segment tag. In some embodiments this entails first identifying the logical datapath set to which the packet belongs. For instance in the example of packets from either of the two VLANs and could arrive on the same physical port of the managed switching element that connects to the network . As such the physical port alone cannot be used to determine the logical datapath set and ingress port in some embodiments. Instead the switching element uses the network segment context tag that was removed at operation to identify the logical datapath set and ingress port. In some embodiments the switching element may also or alternatively use the source machine address to identify the logical datapath set and ingress port.

Next the process identifies at a destination network for the packet. In some embodiments the managed switching element uses the destination address e.g. a MAC address IP address etc. stored in the packet header and matches this destination address to one of the network segments connected by the logical datapath set identified at operation . As shown in above in some embodiments the managed switching element stores a list of all known addresses for each of the network segments connected by each of the logical datapath sets that the switching element implements. In some embodiments the switching element uses a traditional flooding based learning algorithm to handle packets for which it does not recognize the destination in order to determine on which network segment a particular machine is located.

The process next determines at a logical egress port for the identified destination network on the logical datapath set. In some embodiments the identification of the destination network and the subsequent identification of the logical egress port are performed as a single operation by the managed switching element. In addition to making a forwarding decision i.e. mapping to a logical egress port some embodiments also perform other forwarding table operations within the logical processing. For instance some embodiments perform ACL lookups that may contain instructions to drop the packet enqueue the packet e.g. to enforce quality of service controls allow a packet through etc. In some embodiments operations and are performed as a single operation i.e. as a single lookup . That is the managed switching element executes a forwarding table lookup entry that simply matches the destination network of the packet to a logical egress port without having a separate operation for identifying the destination network.

After determining the logical egress port the process encapsulates at the packet with this logical egress port information. That is the managed switching element prepends information to the packet e.g. a logical context that includes the egress port information. An example of such a logical context for OSI Layer 2 processing is described in detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 177 535 incorporated by reference above. This logical context is a 64 bit tag that includes a 32 bit virtual routing function field for representing the logical datapath set to which the packet belongs a 16 bit logical inport field i.e. the ingress port of the datapath that corresponds to the local network segment and a 16 bit logical outport field i.e. the identified logical egress port that corresponds to the destination remote network segment .

At this point the forwarding decisions for the packet are complete and the process transmits at the encapsulated packet towards the physical location of the logical egress port and ends. This location in some embodiments is an interconnection switching element e.g. extender at the edge of the network containing the destination network segment. In some embodiments this transmission actually involves several operations. First the logical egress port is mapped to a physical address e.g. the address of a port on the interconnection switching element . Next this physical address is mapped to a physical port of the managed interconnection switching element performing the operations so that the packet can be transmitted to the next hop. While the remote interconnection switching element is the ultimate destination as far as the logical network is concerned there will generally be several physical switching elements in between the source interconnection switching element and the remote interconnection switching element. In some embodiments a tunnel is defined between the two switching elements and the packet is encapsulated with the tunnel information to be sent over the intervening network.

In conjunction with the forwarding table entries conceptually illustrates the processing pipeline performed by the source interconnection switching element of some embodiments. As shown by the numbers 1 4 when the interconnection switching element receives a packet it uses numerous forwarding table entries to process the packet. In some embodiments the physical and logical tables including any ACL tables are implemented as a single table within the managed switching element e.g. using a dispatch port that returns a packet processed by a first entry to the forwarding table for processing by a second entry .

The VMs in this example refer to those shown in . As shown VM sends a packet that arrives at the source interconnection switching element corresponding to the interconnection switching element . This packet in most cases will not have been sent directly from the VM to the interconnection switching element but will usually have traveled through at least one switching element within the segmented network between the VM and the interconnection switching element.

The managed switching element receives the packet through an interface of the switching element and begins processing the packet using the forwarding tables . The first stage in the processing pipeline is an ingress context mapping stage that maps a physical ingress port i.e. the interface through which the packet was received from VM and packet information e.g. the VLAN tags to a logical ingress port i.e. a port of one of the logical switching elements implemented by the physical switching element that corresponds to the source VLAN .

As shown by the encircled the interconnection switching element identifies a record in the forwarding table that implements the ingress context mapping. Specifically this record identifies the network segment from which the packet was sent VLAN and matches this network segment to a logical port of a particular logical datapath set Port of LDPS A . In this case the forwarding tables include additional records for matching different source VMs on the same and different VLANs to logical ingress ports different source VMs on the same VLAN will be matched to the same port while source VMs on different VLANs are matched to ports of different logical switching elements. Some embodiments only store one record for each network segment for ingress port matching. That is the forwarding tables do not care from which VM the packet originated only using the VLAN or other network segment information. In this case the record specifies that the managed interconnection switching element store the logical context of the packet in a field of the packet s header which indicates the logical inport of a particular logical datapath set for the packet. In some embodiments the record also specifies to send the packet to the dispatch port for additional processing by the forwarding tables

The second stage in the processing pipeline is the logical forwarding lookups . As in the federated network examples shown above the forwarding lookups are illustrated here as a single forwarding table record but may actually involve several different records performing several different functions. For instance the tables do not illustrate any ACL tables which might be present to enforce security policies for packets sent by VM or from VLAN or sent to particular VMs.

As shown by the encircled the interconnection switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements the logical forwarding decision. Specifically this record identifies the packet destination specified in the packet header as a particular VM and sets the logical egress of the packet to be a particular port Port of the already identified logical datapath set. As shown in some embodiments the forwarding table includes records for each of the possible destination addresses i.e. each of the machines on the different network segments connected by the interconnection network . Thus the forwarding table includes records for setting the logical egress to the same Port of the same logical datapath set when the destination is VM and a different Port of the same logical datapath set when the packet destination is VM . In some embodiments the record instead specifies that when a network segment e.g. MPLS Label is matched based on a list of all of the VMs on that network segment the record maps the network segment to a particular port. The record specifies that the managed switching element store the logical egress port in the packet headers i.e. encapsulate the packet with the logical egress context as well as send the packet to its dispatch port.

Based on the logical egress port specified at the second stage of the processing pipeline the managed switching element performs egress context mapping that maps the logical egress port to a physical egress port for the packet within the interconnecting network. For a packet traveling from one network segment at a first site to a different network segment at a second site this will be the physical port of a different interconnection switching element at the second site. As shown by the encircled the source interconnection switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements the egress context mapping. Specifically the record matches the logical egress as Port of LDPS A and sets the destination to be a particular extender that faces the MPLS segmented site containing Label . In some embodiments the destination is set as the MAC address of a particular port i.e. the port facing the interconnecting network of the extender . In some embodiments this involves encapsulating the packet in a tunnel between the managed interconnection switching element and the extender specified as the physical egress port. In some embodiments the record also specifies to send the packet to its dispatch port for further processing.

Finally the managed interconnection switching element performs the physical mapping stage that specifies a physical port of the managed switching element through which to send the now modified packet in order to reach the physical egress port identified by the egress context mapping. As shown by the encircled the interconnection switching element identifies a record in the forwarding tables that implements this physical mapping. Specifically the record matches the destination extender and maps the packet to a port of the interconnection switching element referred to in the table as extender . This port is different from the dispatch port and therefore the packet is now sent out this port towards the destination interconnection switching element for eventual delivery to VM .

Returning to the packet is sent from the local interconnection switching element through the interconnecting network to the remote interconnection switching element i.e. through a tunnel defined between ports of the two switching elements . The remote interconnection switching element executes the logical flow for the interconnection network which involves removing the logical egress encapsulation as the packet has reached its destination as far as the logical network is concerned . The interconnection switching element also adds new segment context information so that the packet can be processed by switching elements on the receiving segmented network and delivered to its destination machine.

As shown the process begins by receiving at an encapsulated packet at a physical port that faces an external interconnecting network with a destination in a segmented network local to the receiving switching element. In some embodiments however the destination cannot yet be determined because the actual end machine destination is hidden within the encapsulation. In many cases the physical switching element will have several ports that face away from the local segmented network but the tunnel between the sending interconnection switching element and the receiving interconnection switching element is defined between particular ports on each switching element.

The process then removes at the encapsulation on the packet. In some embodiments the encapsulation includes a tunneling protocol used to send the packet to the particular receiving interconnection switching element as well as the logical egress context of the packet. The switching element recognizes its ingress port as the end of the tunnel and therefore removes the tunneling encapsulation and additionally recognizes itself as the logical egress port for the packet removing the logical egress information. In some embodiments the switching element stores the logical context information in registers in case the information is needed for further processing.

Next the process identifies at a destination in the segmented network local to the interconnection switching element. In some embodiments the switching element uses the removed logical context to map to a particular segmented network. The logical egress port information about which was removed at operation corresponds to a particular network segment within the local site network. Some embodiments on the other hand use the address of the destination machine e.g. the MAC address to identify the local network segment to which the packet should be sent.

The process then adds at the context tags for the local segmented network. These tags may be a VLAN tag MPLS label MAC in MAC header etc. depending on the segmenting technique used by the local network. The switching element uses its decoding information in some embodiments to determine which bits of the packet should be used for the different portions of the context tag. These portions may include a network identifier e.g. a VLAN ID a destination on the VLAN etc.

Finally the process transmits at the packet onto the local segmented network towards the packet s physical destination then ends. In most cases the packet will not be sent directly from the managed interconnection switching element to the end machine physical machine or virtual machine that is the packet s destination. Instead there will likely be one or more intervening switching elements on the local network that process the packet according to its network segment context tags.

In conjunction with the forwarding table entries conceptually illustrates the processing pipeline performed by the source interconnection switching element of some embodiments. This processing pipeline contains the same four stages as the pipeline shown in for the source interconnection switch ingress context mapping then logical forwarding then egress context mapping and physical forwarding. In some embodiments each managed switching element in a single level logical network performs the same processing pipeline though some of the stages may not actually involve the performance of any operations e.g. at managed switching elements in the middle of a network that simply pass a packet onwards to the next managed switching element .

Thus the first forwarding table record identified by the interconnection switching element implements the ingress context mapping stage. This record shown by the encircled identifies that the logical context has already been set to a particular logical datapath set and performs no additional operation while simply sending the packet to the dispatch port and in some embodiments storing this information to a register . Next the switching element identifies a forwarding table record that identifies that i the packet already includes its logical egress information and ii that information can be removed because the packet has now reached its logical egress. At the egress context mapping stage the switching element identifies that logical egress corresponds to a particular network segment on its local network and that the destination is a particular machine VM on that network segment. Finally at the physical mapping stage the switching element identifies a particular physical port to which it sends the packet in order for the packet to reach its destination on the segmented network.

In the above scenario only two managed switching elements are generally involved for a particular packet the interconnection switching element at the source network and the interconnection switching element at the destination network with a tunnel defined between the two. On the other hand in the multi level interconnection scenario with at least two layers of logical datapath sets in some cases a packet may travel through numerous such interconnection switching elements enabling various traffic forwarding decisions. In this scenario the second level controller can make decisions about which of several paths a packet should take to travel from a source network in a first 1L domain to a destination network in a second 1L domain e.g. through one or the other of two possible intervening 1L domains . The second level controller pushes these decisions down to the first level controllers which implement the decisions within their first level flows sent to the interconnection switching elements within their respective domain.

In Subsection A of this Section a simplistic example was illustrated for the case of interconnecting network segments via multiple levels of logical datapath set. conceptually illustrates a more complex network with four separate 1L domains of three interconnected networks each. For simplicity the segmented networks located behind the twelve interconnection switching elements are not shown in this figure. Instead only a first VM and a second VM are illustrated as these will be used to describe an example packet flow. The hierarchical network includes a first 1L domain West with three interconnection switching elements a second 1L domain North with three interconnection switching elements a third 1L domain South with three interconnection switching elements and a fourth 1L domain East with three interconnection switching elements . Each of these interconnection switching elements is located at the edge of a segmented network e.g. a network segmented using VLANs MPLS Labeling MAC in MAC etc. . In some embodiments the segmented networks may also use the logical network virtualization as described in Section I. Each of the four 1L domains includes a 1L network controller cluster not shown that generates flows and pushes the flows to the interconnection switching elements within the 1L domain. These four 1L network controller clusters are all connected to a 2L network controller cluster that generates 2L flows and pushes the flows to the 1L controller clusters for incorporation within their flows. In addition the 2L network controller cluster may make decisions about the preferred path of several different paths through the 1L domains for packets from different source networks or machines and to different destination networks or machines.

Upon receiving the packet the extender first removes the VLAN context tag and identifies the 1L and then 2L logical ingress ports performing ingress context mapping . The extender performs the 2L logical forwarding decisions including any ACL decisions. The policy decisions implemented by the ACL flow entries may be generated by the 2L controller and then pushed down to the 1L controller and then to the managed switching elements as described above. In addition the 2L logical forwarding identifies an 2L egress port which corresponds to a particular port on extender to which the destination VM attaches. As in the single layer scenario from the previous subsection the extender stores a list of the ports to which different destination addresses e.g. MAC addresses correspond.

After encapsulating the packet with 2L egress information the extender executes the remaining 1L processing pipeline. This includes egress context mapping of the 2L egress port to a particular 1L egress port. In this case the packet can arrive at its destination in the East 1L domain via either the North domain or the South domain. In some embodiments this decision is determined by the 2L controller which determines which path should be taken through the 1L datapaths for packets from different source networks or machines and to different destination networks or machines. The 2L controller of some embodiments might specify that a packet from a particular source either machine or network segment to a particular destination either machine or network segment should travel along a specific set of 1L datapaths. For the originating 1L datapath this will be implemented by specifying an egress port of the 1L datapath that sends the packet to the next hop 1L datapath. Upon arriving at that next 1L datapath the 1L egress port will be determined such that the packet is again sent to the appropriate next 1L datapath. Within the 1L datapath forwarding decisions between physical interconnection switching elements are determined by the 1L controller cluster.

In order to generate the forwarding lookups the 2L controller cluster of some embodiments combines user input specifying policies for traffic as well as network statistics i.e. a traffic matrix received from the 1L controllers. In some embodiments the lower level controllers automatically collect information regarding their respective regions of the interconnecting network i.e. from the switching elements implementing their lower level logical datapath set and pass this information upward to the second level network controller. In some embodiments these statistics relate to the number of packets being sent out and received at various ports of the managed switching elements the travel time of the packets along different paths etc.

In different embodiments the user policies might specify different classes of traffic e.g. high medium and low priority packets guarantee a particular QoS for specific packets while making no guarantees about other packets direct specific packets to follow a particular path etc. The packets might be classified based on source machine source network segment source 1L datapath destination machine destination network segment destination 1L datapath or a combination thereof in different embodiments. For instance a user might specify packets from a VLAN at Network A to a VLAN at Network B to be high priority packets while packets from VLAN at Network A to a VLAN at Network C are low priority packets. As another example the user might specify a particular guaranteed QoS for all packets from a first 1L datapath to a second 1L datapath or from a particular source machine irrespective of destination . One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many different combinations are possible for determining policy.

The 2L controller or associated processing performs an optimization routine e.g. a constrained optimization algorithm to generate the paths through the 1L datapaths. The optimization routine attempts to identify an optimal set of paths for all different possible packets that best carries out the user set policies based on the most recent network statistics. For instance if a particular connection to a particular 1L datapath does not appear reliable then the optimization routine will require the higher priority traffic to follow a different path that does not travel over the unreliable connection so long as a better option is available. For low priority packets the optimization routine will generally choose the best option that will not interfere with the higher priority packets.

In the case illustrated in the optimization performed by the 2L controller has specified that the particular packet should be sent via the South 1L domain rather than the North 1L domain . Accordingly the extender adds the West 1L egress information which specifies the logical egress port connecting to the South 1L domain . The extender maps this logical egress port to a port of the extender and transmits the packet out of its port through a tunnel to the extender .

The packet travels through the West 1L network and arrives at the extender the location of the West 1L egress port towards the South 1L domain. This extender removes the West 1L egress encapsulation and executes interconnection instructions contained within its forwarding tables. The interconnection instructions specify the South 1L ingress port corresponding to a port on extender and the switching element encapsulates the packet with this ingress information and sends the packet through the interconnecting network e.g. through several non managed switching elements to the extender .

The receiving interconnection switching element in the South 1L domain and in a more complex example any additional intervening 1L domains between the source and destination 1L domains does not modify the 2L encapsulation. Instead the extender receives the packet removes the South 1L ingress information and maps the 2L egress port to its own 1L egress port that corresponds to a next 1L datapath. As in the extender this 1L mapping decision is governed by the lookup entries provided by the 2L controller. The extender encapsulates the packet with its South 1L egress information for transmission through the South 1L domain to the extender .

The operations performed by the extender are parallel to those performed by the extender at the edge of the West 1L datapath. This interconnection switching element removes the South 1L egress information as the packet will be exiting the South 1L domain and adds East 1L ingress information . The extender then sends the packet through the interconnecting network to the ingress port of the East 1L domain at extender .

At the East 1L domain the extender first removes the 1L ingress information. Next the extender runs the 2L pipeline which maps the 2L egress port to the East 1L port that corresponds to the extender . As the 2L egress port now maps to a port facing a segmented network rather than a different 1L domain the extender removes the 2L encapsulation as well. The extender adds the 1L egress information and transmits the packet through the East 1L network to the final extender .

This extender includes a port to which a segmented network including the segment VLAN connects. The destination machine VM belongs to this VLAN . Upon receiving the packet the extender removes the 1L encapsulation and uses the information it stores for its network segments including VLAN to add a context tag for VLAN to the packet. The extender then forward the packet onto the segmented network for its eventual arrival at the destination VM .

As mentioned the above example of a two level interconnecting network is a somewhat simplistic example with only two possible paths between the East and West 1L domains. As with the hierarchical networks described in Section II in some embodiments more than two levels may be used to divide a network into separate datapaths. For instance some embodiments might use 1L datapaths to connect networks within a building or a city block 2L datapaths to connect 1L datapaths within a city 3L datapaths to connect 2L datapaths within a region e.g. a state 4L datapaths to connect 3L datapaths within a country etc. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that different geographic regions or other mechanisms for grouping networks may be used.

Within such a hierarchical network the first hop processing at each logical datapath set of a given level will use a set of packet forwarding instructions from the higher level controller to identify the next logical datapath set at the given level. That is just as the set of forwarding instructions from the 2L controller in the example governed the choice of a next 1L datapath each time a packet entered an 1L datapath an 3L controller would generate a set of packet forwarding instructions to govern the choice of a next 2L datapath for packets traveling across 2L datapaths. Thus at the first hop in a three level interconnection network the 3L processing would identify an 3L egress port for this description assumed to be located in a different 2L datapath . Based on a set of forwarding instructions from the 3L controller this 3L egress port maps to an 2L egress port connecting to a particular next 2L datapath. The 2L network controller would also have a generated set of forwarding instructions that describes how to forward the packet internal to its 2L domain in order to get the packet from the current 1L domain to the 1L domain through which the packet exits the datapath.

The above examples describe situations in which the various interconnection switching elements already knew the locations of the destination machines for the packets. However as machines are added to a network or moved from one network segment to another in some cases the interconnection switching elements may not have the required information to make the forwarding decision to a particular logical egress port. In some embodiments the interconnection switching elements use standard learning mechanisms and flood the network of interconnection switching elements in order to identify behind which of the other switching elements a particular destination MAC address is located.

In some embodiments however alternatives to the standard learning by flooding may be used. A centralized solution of some embodiments uses the network controller clusters to accumulate and distribute data. In such an approach the interconnection switching elements e.g. extenders at each segmented network report the addresses e.g. MAC addresses of the machines seen at their site networks to the virtualization application of the network controller. The virtualization application reports these addresses via its logical datapath set abstraction to the centralized control plane of the network controller. The network controller can then compute the necessary updates to the forwarding table i.e. populating the lists of MAC addresses to associate with different logical ports shown in . In effect in the centralized approach the interconnection switching elements all report the MAC addresses on their different network segments to the network controller and the network controller then distributes this information to the other extenders.

Other embodiments use a decentralized approach to learning that does not require flooding. In this approach the interconnection switching elements communicate directly rather than through the central network controller. The interconnection switching elements distribute to the other interconnection switching elements lists of the addresses they have seen at their respective network segments. The addresses may be disseminated whenever there is a change in some embodiments e.g. a new machine with a new address appears in a segmented network .

An additional decentralized approach of some embodiments builds on a distributed lookup service that provides an ability to execute a lookup for an address to site location binding. That is a lookup service exists in a distributed fashion that stores the lists of addresses for different network segments. The interconnection switching elements can send an unresolved address to the lookup service and receive an identification of the network segment at which that address is located.

In some embodiments the same considerations apply to replication of an address resolution protocol ARP database across the sites. Scaling this replication in some embodiments requires replacing the standard flooding based mechanism with one of the centralized or decentralized approaches described above.

Many of the above described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium .

The bus collectively represents all system peripheral and chip set buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of the electronic system . For instance the bus communicatively connects the processing unit s with the read only memory the system memory and the permanent storage device .

From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieve instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the invention. The processing unit s may be a single processor or a multi core processor in different embodiments.

The read only memory ROM stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processing unit s and other modules of the electronic system. The permanent storage device on the other hand is a read and write memory device. This device is a non volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the electronic system is off. Some embodiments of the invention use a mass storage device such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive as the permanent storage device .

Other embodiments use a removable storage device such as a floppy disk flash drive or ZIP disk and its corresponding disk drive as the permanent storage device. Like the permanent storage device the system memory is a read and write memory device. However unlike storage device the system memory is a volatile read and write memory such a random access memory. The system memory stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some embodiments the invention s processes are stored in the system memory the permanent storage device and or the read only memory . From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieve instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some embodiments.

The bus also connects to the input and output devices and . The input devices enable the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. The input devices include alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices also called cursor control devices . The output devices display images generated by the electronic system. The output devices include printers and display devices such as cathode ray tubes CRT or liquid crystal displays LCD . Some embodiments include devices such as a touchscreen that function as both input and output devices.

Finally as shown in bus also couples electronic system to a network through a network adapter not shown . In this manner the computer can be a part of a network of computers such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or an Intranet or a network of networks such as the Internet. Any or all components of electronic system may be used in conjunction with the invention.

Some embodiments include electronic components such as microprocessors storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine readable or computer readable medium alternatively referred to as computer readable storage media machine readable media or machine readable storage media . Some examples of such computer readable media include RAM ROM read only compact discs CD ROM recordable compact discs CD R rewritable compact discs CD RW read only digital versatile discs e.g. DVD ROM dual layer DVD ROM a variety of recordable rewritable DVDs e.g. DVD RAM DVD RW DVD RW etc. flash memory e.g. SD cards mini SD cards micro SD cards etc. magnetic and or solid state hard drives read only and recordable Blu Ray discs ultra density optical discs any other optical or magnetic media and floppy disks. The computer readable media may store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code such as is produced by a compiler and files including higher level code that are executed by a computer an electronic component or a microprocessor using an interpreter.

While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi core processors that execute software some embodiments are performed by one or more integrated circuits such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . In some embodiments such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
