This application is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 355 094 entitled Wide Field Retinal Prosthesis filed Feb. 15 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 190 266 the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Health care providers researchers and medical device makers have invested considerable resources in efforts to effectively improve the vision of or provide vision to those with little or no vision capabilities. Various types of retinal disease can be the cause of complete or near blindness such as age related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Each is a degenerative disease that causes severe degradation of the outer retina. Macular degeneration causes loss of central vision making reading impossible while retinitis pigmentosa initially causes gradual loss of peripheral vision followed by loss of central vision resulting in total blindness.

The retina is a light sensitive layer at the back of the eye that includes photosensitive cells called rods and cones. The optic nerve is a collection of nerve fibers that carry electric signals generated from light stimulation of the rods and cones to the brain for vision processing. In each disease above the rods and cones at the back of the retina degenerate. As the degeneration progresses the retina becomes increasingly insensitive to light. This ultimately causes blindness. Importantly the optic nerve is not affected as significantly as the outer retina the pathway to the brain remains available and viable for communicating electrical signals to the brain for vision processing.

In the conditions described above proper stimulation of the remnant retina could improve or return sight to the vision impaired or blind patient. Toward that end retinal prosthesis have been developed that can be implanted in the eye as a means of stimulating the rods and cones from the surface of the retina. In fact U.S. Pat. No. 5 597 381 entitled Methods of Epi Retinal Implantation describes approaches for implanting a retinal prosthesis over the retina through an incision in the sclera. As described in the patent implantation of the prosthesis allows electrical stimulation of the retinal neurons to convey at least the outlines of a visual scene transmitted to the prosthesis as by an infrared laser radio frequency source or other wireless techniques from outside the eye. While the retinal prosthesis does not enable substantially restored vision it offers relative improvement and the implantation techniques may be useful for makers of improved retinal prosthesis.

To date the most common retinal prosthesis use flexible electrodes developed for stimulation of peripheral nerves and retina. These use polymers such as polyimide poly dimethyl siloxane and parylene as substrates for embedding arrays used to electrically stimulate the retina. Generally greater coverage of the retina by electrodes in the retinal prosthesis enables more complete stimulation of the retina and therefore better vision. With prior typical retinal electrode arrays or prosthesis the size of scleral incision must be bigger than the width of the prosthesis to be able to insert the prosthesis into the eye. However a big scleral incision can distort the shape of the eye and may be associated with more surgical complications as a result current retinal prosthesis are small in size which has the disadvantage of covering only a small area of the retina.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 368 349 entitled Inflatable Neural Prosthesis discloses an approach for implanting a relatively large retinal prosthesis through a relatively small opening. The prosthesis disclosed in this patent includes a foldable substrate and at least one electronic component supported by the substrate with at least one micro channel disposed within the substrate for providing a fluid for inflating i.e. unfolding the prosthesis after being inserted through the incision in the sclera. However too much fluid pressure during inflation could cause the prosthesis to be damaged which could in turn cause damage to the eye. Additionally the required micro channel adds a level of complexity and cost to the prosthesis and consumes area that could have been otherwise used for the stimulation electrodes. Thus inflatable retinal prosthesis have certain drawbacks. For example like other retinal prosthesis they cannot easily conform to the curvature of the eye and if the array is big some parts of it may be far away from the retina while the other parts may exert pressure on the retina and cause retinal damage.

In accordance with one aspect of the present inventive concepts provided is an apparatus and for stimulating vision wherein the apparatus is configured to receive stimulation signals. The apparatus comprises a flexible substrate configured for implantation on a retina wherein the substrate comprises a central member and at least one wing extending along at least a portion of a peripheral edge of the central member and defining a gap therebetween. An array of retina stimulators is disposed within the substrate and configured to stimulate the retina in response to receipt of the stimulation signals.

In accordance with another aspect of the present inventive concepts provided is a non inflatable apparatus for stimulating vision wherein the apparatus is configured to receive stimulation signals. The apparatus comprises a flexible substrate configured for implantation on a retina wherein the substrate comprises a central member and at least one wing extending from the central member the substrate void of any micro channels inflation means. An array of stimulators is disposed within the substrate and configured to stimulate the retina in response to receipt of the stimulation signals wherein the substrate and array of retina stimulators are further configured to compact to fit within a scleral incision of less than the width of the substrate.

In accordance with another aspect of the present inventive concepts provided is a method of stimulating vision. The method comprises providing a flexible substrate configured for implantation on a retina wherein the substrate comprises a central member and at least one wing extending along at least a portion of a peripheral edge of the central member and defining a gap therebetween. The method also includes providing an array of retina stimulators disposed within the substrate and configured to stimulate the retina in response to receipt of stimulation signals and compacting the substrate and array of retina stimulators to fit within a scleral incision of less than the width of the substrate. The method further includes implanting the substrate and array of retina stimulators through the scleral incision.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention provided is a cable used for communicating stimulation signals to retina stimulators in a retinal prosthesis. The cable comprises a plurality of layers including at least a first layer having disposed therein a first set of transmission paths and a second layer having disposed therein a second set of transmission paths wherein the first set of transmission paths is isolated from the second set of transmission path.

A wide field retinal prosthesis or retinal array is provided that uses retinal stimulating arrays to create vision in both the central and peripheral visual fields. The wide field retinal prosthesis includes a central member and at least one wing having retinal stimulators embedded therein. The retinal stimulators of the prosthesis cover a substantially wider area of the retina than is typically achievable with prior retinal prosthesis. This enables stimulation of more of the rods and cones of the retina resulting in a wider field of view and better quality vision for the patient. In the preferred forms the wide field retinal prosthesis achieves these improvements without a larger incision in the sclera than would be typical for smaller retinal prosthesis. This is preferably accomplished with a substrate that can be compacted e.g. rolled prior to implantation and then uncompacted e.g. unrolled after implantation.

To help affix the wide field retinal prosthesis to the eye any customary means presently known or later developed or discovered may be used. In the affixing means takes the form of a retinal tack not shown so a tack hole is defined within the retinal prosthesis to accommodate the tack. In various embodiments more tack holes could be included and could additionally or alternatively be located within one or more of the wings or the central member. A cable may be provided as a means for stimulating electrodes embedded in the wide field retinal prosthesis . The juncture where the cable meets the wings and central member may be referred to as the base of the retinal prosthesis. In other embodiments the electrodes could be stimulated by other means including wireless means from outside the eye such as for example by an infrared laser or a radio frequency source or by other wireless techniques. When included one or more tack holes may be formed in the cable.

There is a narrow space generally defined between the central member and substantial lengths of the two wings . Space allows freedom of movement of the wings relative to the central member which allows the retinal prosthesis to better conform to the shape of the surface of the eye. It may also make the wide field retinal prosthesis more pliable for compacting e.g. rolling or folding prior to implantation through an incision in the sclera. In addition to space a gap may be formed between the ends of the wings distal from the base of the wide field retinal prosthesis. The outer edge of the gap A may be wider than the inner edge B as described in greater detail below.

When prosthetic is disposed on the retina it conforms to the curvature of the eye the space between the wings and the central member and the gap between the distal ends of wings prevents formation of folds in the prosthetic. The gap between the distal ends of the wings is preferably large enough to prevent overlapping of the wings on each other once implanted. The minimum required distance depends on the diameter of the array and the width of wings and can be calculated in a relatively straightforward manner.

As an example demonstrates an approach to calculating the outer edge A and inner edge B of gap of . In this embodiment it is presumed that the central member has a diameter of 4 millimeters mm and each of wings has a width of 3 mm. While the thickness of the wide field retinal prosthesis need not be uniform in this embodiment it is presumed to be about 15 microns m . In wide field retinal prosthesis is shown implanted on the inner surface of a retina . In other embodiments the wide field prosthesis could be disposed on the outer surface of the retina . Point represents a center of a circle that would include the surface of the retina . Line represents the distance from center point to the center of the wide field retinal prosthesis and surface of the retina and is 11 mm. Line represents the distance between the outer edges of the now curved central member and measures about 3.978 mm. And line represents the distance between the center point and one edge of the central member . Line represents the distance between the outer edges of the now curved wings and measures about 9.66 mm. And line represents the distance between the center point and one edge of one of wings . Using these parameters the outer edge of the gap A is calculated to be 1070 m and the inner edge of the gap B is calculated to be 70 m. The gap can be calculated in a number of different manners using known equations.

In order to insert the wide field retinal prosthetic into the eye the wings may be overlapped on the central member to reduce its overall diameter examples of which are shown in and . The drawings are not to scale they are merely used to demonstrate examples of the concepts. Using such an approach wide field retinal prosthetic can be inserted through a sclera incision which is slightly bigger than the width of the central member. Keeping with the illustrative embodiment of the overall diameter of the wide field retinal prosthesis is about 10 mm and the central member is about 4 mm therefore the scleral incision may be slightly larger than about 4 mm. But as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the present invention and illustrative embodiments are not limited to these dimensions. shows another approach to implanting prosthetic . In this approach prosthetic could be rolled inside a tube and the overall diameter at the time of insertion may even be less than the width of central member .

The embodiment of represent one preferred embodiment but the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment. For instance one or more tack holes may be used and they may be located on the cable on the wings or both as examples. The wings and central member may accommodate a variable number of electrodes the pattern need not be uniform through the prosthetic. Depending on the application the density of electrodes need not be uniform. For example there could be a higher density toward the center of the retina e.g. within the central member and less dense toward the periphery e.g. in the wings similar to the concentration of nerves in the eye. The width or other dimensions of the central member or wings could be altered according to the need and they may be similar or different. In some embodiments there may be two holes near the tip of the wings for passing a temporary suture through to make overlapping the wings during insertion easier.

Additionally the cable may be wider near the array for the benefit of providing stiffness for improved handling. The cable may be in one layer or several layers for reducing the width. For example there could be up to 10 layers though 5 layers or les may be sufficient for typical applications. There may be multiple wings 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc. . The wings may extend from the base of the central member they may radiate from the central member or some combination thereof. Increasing the number of wings can reduce the size of scleral incision. The wide field retinal prosthetic may be sub retinal or epi retinal as discussed above. The edges of the prosthetic may be made thinner than the other portions of the prosthetic to prevent inadvertent cutting of the retina during insertion and to reduce the pressure effects at the edge. The thickness of the prosthetic may vary between different parts the wings may be thicker or thinner than central member. Some parts of the prosthetic may be made thicker like a skeleton in the middle of the wings and or central member to make it stronger and more conformable. The skeleton thus has greater rigidity than other portions of the substrate from which the central member and wings are formed. This may be accomplished by thickening the substrate in the skeleton or adding a rigid material to the substrate. Generally the prosthesis should be stiff enough for handling without compromising its ability to conform to the retina.

The following figures are some examples of embodiments with variations over the prosthetic of . is a wide field retinal prosthesis similar to that of with a tack hole in cable but also includes two holes on the wings. is an embodiment of a wide field retinal array with 4 wings. This embodiment is similar to that of but includes two additional outer wings . Tack holes are shown in the inner wings and electrodes similar to electrodes are included for illustrative purposes.

As discussed above unlike prior retinal prosthesis a wide field retinal prosthesis in accordance with various aspects of the present invention may offer one or more of the following advantages 

a. the wide field retinal prosthesis may include one or more wings so that it easily conforms to the surface of the retina 

b. there is no need for a big scleral incision depending on the number of wings it may be possible to insert the prosthesis through a scleral incision as small as about one half to one forth of the overall diameter of the prosthesis and in some embodiment a sclera incision of as little as 1 mm may be used if the prosthesis were sufficiently compactable then perhaps a smaller scleral incision could be used 

c. the wide field retinal prosthesis can be rolled or otherwise compacted to be inserted through a sclerotomy about half or less e.g. about one fourth the width of the unrolled device.

d. it is possible to insert a very big prosthesis into the eye to cover a much larger area of the retina which allows a significantly greater field of vision e.g. about 60 

While the embodiments shown herein do not include micro channels as means for inflating the wide field retinal prosthesis such means could be included in various embodiments without departing from the present invention. Generally the prosthesis may have sufficient memory or rigidity to take its intended form once inserted through the scleral incision. In other embodiments the prosthesis may be sufficiently pliable to be unfolded after insertion through the scleral incision using instrumentation or other applications of pressure or force.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other preferred embodiments it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments and that they may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. As used herein the terms includes and including mean without limitation. It is intended by the following claims to claim any and all modifications and variations that fall within the true scope of the inventive concepts.
