This application is the National Stage of International Application No. PCT EP2012 071401 filed Oct. 29 2012 which in turn claims priority to and benefit of British Patent Application No. GB1118774.7 filed Oct. 31 2011. The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are herein expressly incorporated by reference.

The invention relates to fluid distribution in an exposure device. The exposure device in some examples is a device for exposing living cell cultures or cellular tissues to a fluid such as cigarette smoke air and or other gases or gas mixtures for use in studies of the effects on the cell cultures or tissues of their exposure to the fluid.

Various exposure devices are known for the delivery of gaseous matter to living cell cultures. Known devices facilitate the delivery of smoke and or other fluids to cell culture chambers. The cell culture chambers can be used to hold a substrate or membrane containing the living cell cultures and may or may not be supplied with nutrient medium.

Certain known exposure devices involve controlling the introduction of smoke individually into specific cell culture chambers resulting in relatively complex and costly devices. The device described in International Patent Publication WO03 100417 addresses this issue by providing a single chamber into which smoke is directed via a fluid dispersing means.

According to embodiments of the invention from a first aspect there is provided a fluid distribution member for distributing a fluid in a fluid exposure device the distribution member comprising a plurality of apertures in a surface of the member arranged such that when the distribution member is fitted to the fluid exposure device the distribution member receives fluid applied to the surface of the member and distributes the fluid via the apertures to samples to be exposed to the fluid in the exposure device.

The samples can be disposed in a plurality of sample chambers within the fluid exposure device and the apertures can be arranged in use so as to distribute the fluid to each of the plurality of sample chambers in the fluid exposure device.

The apertures can be provided in the form of a plurality of elongate slots or sets of slots extending in parallel across the distribution member. The slots can be arranged in accordance with an arrangement of samples to be exposed to the fluid in the fluid exposure device. The arrangement of samples can comprise an arrangement in a microtiter well format. The fluid distribution member can comprise between 2 and 30 slots or sets of one or more slots.

The fluid distribution member can comprise a side wall extending perpendicularly to the surface and circumscribing the surface.

The fluid distribution member can comprise a fluid exposure device connection part for use in releasably connecting the member to the fluid exposure device. The fluid exposure device connection part can be arranged for use in connecting the member to the fluid exposure device in a limited number of orientations.

According to embodiments of the invention from a second aspect there is provided a connecting member for connecting a fluid distribution member to a fluid exposure device the connecting member configured to releasably connect a plurality of fluid distribution members individually to the fluid exposure device.

The connecting member can be further configured to releasably connect the plurality of fluid distribution members individually to the fluid exposure device in a limited number of orientations with respect to the fluid exposure device.

The connecting member can be configured to releasably connect a plurality of fluid distribution members individually to a fluid exposure device.

The connecting member can further comprise an inlet for receiving fluid to be distributed by a fluid distribution member when connected by the connecting member to the fluid exposure device and one or more channels for supplying the fluid from the inlet to a surface of the fluid distribution member.

According to embodiments of the invention from a third aspect there is provided a fluid exposure device for exposing samples to a fluid the device arranged to receive a fluid distribution member as described herein.

The fluid exposure device can further comprise a fluid distribution member as described herein wherein the device is arranged to provide the fluid to the surface of the member such that the distribution member distributes the fluid via the apertures to the samples.

The fluid exposure device can further comprise a cavity for receiving a plurality of sample chambers the device being configured to provide substantially contemporaneous and uniform fluid exposure to each of the sample chambers.

The fluid can comprise at least one selected from single gases or mixtures of gases combustion smoke cigarette smoke air exhaust gases cosmetic and pharmaceutical aerosols other aerosolised consumer goods pesticides herbicides and engineered nanoparticles.

According to embodiments of the invention from a fourth aspect there is provided a fluid exposure kit comprising a plurality of fluid distribution members each as described herein a connecting member as described herein and a fluid exposure device as described herein.

According to embodiments of the invention from a fifth aspect there is provided a method of exposing samples to a fluid in a fluid exposure device the method comprising providing a fluid to a surface of a fluid distribution member the surface comprising a plurality of apertures such that the fluid is distributed via the apertures to samples to be exposed to the fluid in the exposure device.

The exposure device used in the method can comprise a part of the fluid exposure kit described herein and the method can further comprise selecting a particular fluid distribution member from the plurality of fluid distribution members according to an arrangement of samples to be exposed in the fluid exposure device and connecting the selected fluid distribution member to the fluid exposure device using the connecting member.

Referring to an exposure device fluid distribution member and connecting member in accordance with an embodiment of the invention are illustrated.

The exposure device includes a base portion and a lid portion manufactured from polymethylmethacrylate PMMA Perspex which can be connected together using connectors in this example threaded bolts to which extend upwardly from a periphery of the base portion and are received through corresponding holes in the lid portion and fastened with manually operated nuts to . In the present example the exposure device is arranged to expose samples in the form of living cell cultures to a fluid. The base portion and lid portion include respective cavities which come together to form an exposure chamber in which a plurality of sample exposure chambers in the illustrated example mounted in a predetermined arrangement within a single unit may be received and exposed to fluid. The exposure chambers can contain living cell cultures or other samples such as tissue samples to be exposed to a fluid.

Exposure devices such as that illustrated in are increasingly required to expose larger numbers of sample chambers to fluids in different chamber arrangements to increase flexibility minimise duration and improve efficiency of fluid exposure studies. However the inventors have observed that it can become difficult to provide substantially uniform fluid to each of the chambers as the number of sample chambers increases.

The fluid distribution member also referred to herein as a conduit comprises a surface having a plurality of apertures disposed therein for distributing a fluid to the chambers disposed in the exposure chamber . In use the distribution member receives fluid applied to the surface and distributes the fluid via the apertures to samples to be exposed to the fluid in the exposure device as will be described in more detail below. This can enable substantially uniform fluid distribution to each of the samples even with increasing numbers of individual samples to be exposed.

A connecting member also referred to herein as a connector or a manifold is used to connect the fluid distribution member to the exposure device . The connecting member includes a mechanism for releasably connecting a fluid distribution member to the fluid exposure device . In cases in which an exposure device is to be configured to expose a variety of sample arrangements to a fluid the exposure device can be supplied together with a plurality of fluid distribution members such that these can be individually connected to the fluid exposure device using the connecting member as required.

In the present example the fluid exposure chamber is substantially in the shape of a rectangular cuboid. An air tight seal is provided between the base and lid portions . In particular in the illustrated example a raised rubber seal is provided on an upper surface of the base portion surrounding the base portion cavity and is received within a corresponding groove provided in the lid portion surrounding the lid portion cavity when the base and the lid portion are connected to create an air tight seal between the base and lid portions .

Alternatively the seal can be provided in other ways. For instance the rubber seal and groove can be interchanged such that the rubber seal is provided in the lid portion and the groove is provided in the base portion . Also the groove may be omitted and a raised rubber seal or another seal arrangement formed in either the base or the lid portion may be brought into contact with a surface of the other of the base or lid portion to create a seal.

As an alternative or in addition to the rubber seal and groove the lid portion may include a lip not shown projecting down from the internal rim of the lid cavity which when the lid portion is brought into association with the base portion fits into the top peripheral edge of the base cavity and acts as a guide to correctly position the lid portion in relation to the base portion . The base portion may alternatively include a lip not shown projecting up from the internal rim of the base cavity which when the lid portion is brought into association with the base portion fits into the bottom peripheral edge of the lid cavity and acts as a guide to correctly position the lid portion in relation to the base portion . Such a lip whether in the base or lid portion may for instance include a rubber or other seal for sealing the base and lid portions together.

In the present example the connecting member includes a fluid inlet leading to a conduit within the connecting member which extends through the lid portion and which is used to supply fluid such as smoke to a fluid distribution outlet unit disposed on the underside of the lid portion between the lid portion and the fluid distribution member .

The fluid exits the exposure chamber via first and second fluid outlets and disposed at opposite ends of the exposure chamber and separated a distance from the fluid distribution member for instance 2 mm to 20 mm from the edge of the fluid distribution member preferably 5 mm to 10 mm. The first and or second fluid outlets may be releasably connected to lid portion for instance with a nut and thread arrangement such as first and second nuts disposed either side of the lid portion engaging with a peripheral thread on the outlets such that the first and or second outlets can be removed for cleaning or replacement with alternative outlets for instance alternative outlets having different internal conduit cross sections allowing fluid to exit the exposure device at a different rate.

The first and second outlets each have a shaft extending into the exposure chamber through the lid portion cavity and into the base portion cavity . In the present example the shafts extend such that they terminate either side of and below the height of the chambers within the base portion cavity and in particular at a position about half of the chamber height from the base of the base portion cavity .

In use a plurality of cell culture chambers are populated with cell cultures and placed into the base portion cavity . The lid portion is connected to the base portion using the connectors so as to form a sealed exposure chamber having an inlet and first and second outlets and . An exposure fluid such as cigarette smoke is supplied to the inlet and travels through the central conduit located within the connecting member to the fluid distribution outlet . The fluid distribution member receives the fluid from the fluid distribution outlet and applies the fluid to the surface of the fluid distribution member in which the apertures are formed. The fluid distribution member accordingly distributes the fluid via the apertures to the cell cultures located within the culture chambers located within the exposure chamber of the exposure device . The fluid is drawn out of the exposure chamber via the first and second outlets and . Since the shafts of the first and second outlets extend to a position below the height of the chambers fluid is encouraged to take a path via the chambers rather than flowing directly from the inlet to the first and second outlets .

The connecting member in the illustrated example comprises the fluid inlet entering the conduit within an externally threaded tubular section on which is screwed a connecting nut for connecting the connecting member to the exposure device in the present example to the lid portion of the exposure device . The connecting member may accordingly be releasably connected to the lid portion such that the connecting member can be removed for cleaning or replacement with alternative connectors for instance alternative connectors having different internal conduit cross sections allowing fluid to enter the exposure device at a different rate.

The threaded tubular section extends into a square cross sectioned shaft which when the connecting member is connected to the exposure device is arranged to extend through a square hole not shown in the lid portion . The shaft is connected to the fluid distribution outlet which is formed as a generally cylindrical member axially aligned with the shaft and of greater diameter than the width of the shaft having a plurality of outlet channels in the present case four such channels distributed around the outer circumference of the cylinder. The channels lead into a central hub not shown within the fluid distribution outlet which in turn leads into the internal conduit extending within the shaft and threaded tubular section connecting the channels to the inlet . The channels are spaced symmetrically about the fluid distribution outlet so as to substantially uniformly distribute fluid from the fluid inlet to the upper surface of the fluid distribution member .

The connecting member further comprises a fluid distribution member connecting portion for connecting the fluid distribution member to the exposure device in the present example to the lid portion of the exposure device . In the present example the fluid distribution member connecting portion comprises a lug in the form of a projection having a square cross section for receiving the fluid distribution member which comprises a corresponding square aperture . The lug projects from the under side of the fluid distribution outlet against which the distribution member sits when connected. The lug can be arranged to project a distance from the under side of the fluid distribution outlet corresponding to the thickness of the distribution member such that the base of the lug does not extend below the fluid distribution member . First and second distribution member connecting screws and fasten the fluid distribution member to the connecting member passing through first and second holes in the distribution member and engaging with threaded bores not shown within the fluid distribution outlet . The threaded bores are arranged such that they do not coincide with the channels in the fluid distribution outlet .

Since the connecting member has a square cross sectioned shaft which is received in a corresponding square hole in the upper wall of the lid portion the connecting member is limited in the number of orientations in which it can be connected to the exposure device in the present case four orientations. Since the connecting member is symmetrical in two planes the specific one of these four orientations which is chosen will not influence the operation of the connecting member . Accordingly the connecting member and therefore components of the member such as the outlets can be accurately oriented with respect to the exposure device and as the connecting nut for connecting the connecting member to the exposure device is tightened the connecting member is prevented from rotating in relation to the exposure device .

The lug of the connecting member also has a square cross section which is received in a corresponding square hole in the fluid distribution member . The fluid distribution member is therefore limited in the number of orientations in which it can be connected to the connecting member in the present case to four orientations. Accordingly the fluid distribution member can be accurately oriented with respect to the connecting member and accordingly with respect to the exposure device .

The fluid distribution member is formed as a substantially flat plate having a raised wall at its peripheral edge which in use contacts a surface of the exposure device . In particular in the present example when the fluid distribution member is fitted to the exposure device the wall is brought into contact with the flat inside surface of the lid portion of the exposure device and a chamber is formed between the flat inside surface of the lid portion the peripheral wall of the fluid distribution member and the upper surface of the fluid distribution member . In use exposure fluid enters this chamber and disperses throughout the chamber prior to passing through the apertures as previously described.

The exposure device is arranged to accommodate multiple cell culture chambers for instance in pre existing arrangements such as a Microtitre plate also referred to as a microplate or microwell plate which is a flat plate with multiple chambers also referred to as wells. Such a plate may have 6 12 24 48 54 96 384 or 1536 sample wells arranged in a 2 3 or 3 4 rectangular matrix for instance 2 rows and 3 columns of wells 4 rows and 6 columns of wells 8 rows and 12 columns of wells etc. The use of such sample plates for instance the 96 well plate facilitates the analysis of the samples with an automated plate reader such as the Cellomics ArrayScan VTI HCS Reader. Fluid distribution member illustrated in is configured for use with the chambers . In the present example the fluid distribution member has a similar shape and size to the topography of the chambers in particular being generally rectangular in shape. The fluid distribution member also includes apertures which correspond to individual chambers or groups of chambers . For instance in the illustrated example the apertures are individually arranged to correspond to single wells of a 96 well plate and accordingly in use to distribute fluid to such wells uniformly.

The exposure device is also arranged such that fluid distribution members can be interchanged and accordingly such that other fluid distribution member aperture arrangements can be readily used by disconnecting a fluid distribution member connected to the exposure device using the connecting member and connecting an alternative distribution member using the connecting member . It will therefore be understood that distribution members which have been optimised for particular arrangements of samples and or types of matter or fluid to be exposed in the exposure device can be selectively connected to the exposure device . As an example arrangements of cell culture chambers which are non symmetrical or only symmetrical in 2 planes such as those illustrated in require corresponding fluid distribution members and these can be selected on that basis.

Although the fluid distribution member illustrated in and comprises apertures corresponding to wells or chambers within a 96 well plate and arranged to expose smoke to cell cultures within the wells distribution members can alternatively be used which have apertures corresponding to and used to distribute smoke or other fluids substantially uniformly to other well or chamber arrangements such as arrangements having 6 12 24 48 96 384 or 1536 sample wells and or containing other samples such as mammalian lung skin and or oral cell cultures human or rodent whole lung slices saliva and or prokaryotes bacterial cells for genotoxicity testing . Other suitable samples would be apparent to those skilled in the art. One particular example is the exposure of lung epithelial cells to cigarette smoke in a 96 well format.

In a fluid distribution member manufactured from a 1 mm thick plate of stainless steel comprises an arrangement of 2.5 mm diameter circular apertures spaced apart such that approximately one aperture corresponds to every other well of a 96 well plate. In particular whereas a 96 well plate can include wells arranged in a 12 by 8 format with 12 columns of wells and 8 rows the apertures in the fluid distribution member of are arranged in a 12 by 4 format with 12 columns of apertures each having 4 apertures offset from immediately neighbouring columns by half the space between apertures in the column such that substantially every other well of a 96 well plate has a corresponding aperture. At the centre of the distribution member is provided a square aperture for connecting the distribution member to an exposure device using a connecting member such as that illustrated in and . In the region of this square connecting aperture a number of apertures two in this case are omitted. Such apertures coincide with the square aperture or would otherwise be close to the outlet channels in the connecting member potentially resulting in a non uniform fluid distribution if they were located in such a position.

In a fluid distribution member manufactured from a 1 mm thick plate of stainless steel comprises an arrangement of 2.5 mm diameter circular apertures spaced apart such that approximately one aperture corresponds to each well of a 96 well plate. In particular the apertures in the fluid distribution member of are arranged in a 12 by 8 format with 12 columns of apertures each having 8 apertures aligned with the apertures of neighbouring columns such that substantially every well of a 96 well plate has a corresponding aperture. Similarly to the member of at the centre of the distribution member a square aperture for connecting the distribution member to an exposure device using a connecting member such as that illustrated in and is provided. A number of apertures four in this case are omitted from this region for the reasons mentioned above.

In a fluid distribution member manufactured from a 1 mm thick plate of stainless steel comprises an arrangement of 2.0 mm wide by 60 mm slotted substantially rectangular apertures spaced apart such that approximately one aperture corresponds to each column of wells in a 96 well plate. In particular the apertures in the fluid distribution member of are arranged in a 12 slot format with the 12 slots running parallel to each other and corresponding to columns of wells in a 96 well plate. Similarly to the members and of at the centre of the distribution member a square aperture for connecting the distribution member to an exposure device using a connecting member such as that illustrated in and is provided. There is a break in the length of the slots resulting in two sets of two slots arranged either side of the square aperture in this region for the reasons mentioned above.

In a fluid distribution member manufactured from a 1 mm thick plate of stainless steel comprises an arrangement of 8.0 mm diameter circular apertures spaced apart such that approximately one aperture corresponds to each well of a 96 well plate. In particular the apertures in the fluid distribution member of are arranged in a 12 by 8 format with 12 columns of apertures each having 8 apertures aligned with the apertures of neighbouring columns such that substantially every well of a 96 well plate has a corresponding aperture. Similarly to the members and of at the centre of the distribution member a square aperture for connecting the distribution member to an exposure device using a connecting member such as that illustrated in and is provided. A number of apertures four in this case are omitted from this region for the reasons mentioned above.

Advantageous features have been described above in relation to specific embodiments of the exposure device fluid distribution member and connecting member having specific implementations. However the present disclosure is not limited to such specific embodiments.

For example although the exposure device has been described as being arranged to accommodate cell culture chambers other containers to be exposed to fluids can be used in the present exposure devices.

Also the exposure device has been described as one which in use only has inlets and outlets for the exposure fluid. However the device can also be adapted to include an inlet and an outlet for nutrient media used to support cell cultures in culture chambers within the device. There are for instance 96 well and other plates commercially available containing a porous membrane support which would allow nutrient supply via liquid cell culture medium into the chamber during exposure to smoke. Corning HTS Transwell 96 Permeable Support Plates for Cell Migration as supplied by Fisher Scientific are an example of such plates. The device can be adapted to accommodate nutrient media for instance in accordance with the device described in International Patent Publication No. WO03 100417 the entirety of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

Although the exposure device as been described as being manufactured from Perspex and the distribution plates from stainless steel other materials can be used for either or both of these components such as stainless steel glass PTFE Perspex etc.

Exposure devices as described herein have the advantage that the distribution plate can be quickly and easily replaced according to the requirements of exposure concerned. A particular connection device has been described for achieving this having a shaft with a square cross section for extending through a portion of the exposure device and a lug with a square cross section onto which the distribution plates can be screwed. Using a non circular shaped shaft and lug mating with corresponding square apertures in the exposure device and distribution plate enables the connecting member and distribution plate to be easily aligned in the correct manner with the exposure device. However other arrangements can be used such as other shapes of shaft and or lug to achieve the desired advantages or other connecting mechanisms such as other screw arrangements latches etc.

Furthermore the connecting member has been described as a removable component from the exposure device as well as having a fluid conduit extending therethrough for instance allowing alternative connection members to be used with different diameters of fluid conduit or arranged to receive different smoke distribution members based on the shape of the connecting lug or equivalent arrangement. However the connecting member can alternatively be provided as a permanent component of a distribution plate and or or exposure device. Also the fluid inlet need not be provided as a part of the connecting member and or the exposure device can contain a permanent non replaceable fluid distribution member.

The fluid used in the exposure device can comprise any fluid which it may be desirable to expose samples to and which is compatible with the materials from which the exposure device and related components are manufactured. For instance the fluid may be combustion smoke for instance cigarette smoke as described above air exhaust gases single gases or mixtures of gases cosmetic and pharmaceutical aerosols other aerosolised consumer goods such as cleaning products pesticides herbicides and engineered nanoparticles permitting there is a generator for such aerosols etc.

Although the fluid distribution members illustrated in comprise apertures corresponding to wells or chambers within a 96 well plate and arranged to expose smoke to cell cultures within the wells distribution members can alternatively be used which have apertures corresponding to and used to distribute smoke or other fluids substantially uniformly to other well or chamber arrangements such as arrangements having 6 12 24 48 96 384 or 1536 sample wells. For example the slotted distribution plate of may include between 2 and 30 slots or sets of one or more slots for instance 2 3 4 6 8 10 12 15 16 18 20 24 28 or 30 slots or sets of one or more slots. The number of slots may be determined based on the number of rows or columns of chambers or wells used in a sample plate.

A fluid exposure device was used to test the viability of cells exposed to cigarette smoke to determine the uniformity of smoke distribution when distribution members as described herein with reference to were fitted into the device.

Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells H292 were seeded at a density of 2 10cells ml cell passages 85 100 into the central 60 wells of a number of 96 well plates leaving a border of 36 wells blank as per standard procedure . Each of the 96 well plates was inserted into an exposure chamber of an exposure device fitted with a respective one of the four fluid distribution members described with reference to . A Borgwaldt RM20S smoking machine was used to generate smoke at the ISO regime using 10 mg 3R4F reference cigarettes. Cells were exposed for 30 minutes at the air plastic interface API and each fluid distribution member was tested with a minimum of two smoke dilutions in particular a cigarette smoke and air mixture in a 1 25 smoke air volume ratio and a cigarette smoke and air mixture in a 1 50 smoke air volume ratio.

Cell viability of exposed cells was assessed using a commercially available assay Cell Titer Glo assay following the standard procedure.

The results indicate that the slotted fluid distribution plate illustrated in gave the most uniform smoke distribution of the four plates on test. This plate was also tested with a cigarette smoke and air mixture in a 1 250 smoke air volume ratio and a cigarette smoke and air mixture in a 1 10 smoke air volume ratio. The surface contours of cell viability within the slotted plate when tested with a 1 250 1 50 1 25 and 1 10 smoke air volume ratio are respectively presented in 2 dimensions in . As can be seen from these graphs substantially uniform cell viability was observed when the slotted distribution plate of was used across the broad range of smoke dilutions.
