title: System and method for capture and rendering of performance on synthetic musical instrument
abstract: Techniques have been developed for capturing and rendering musical performances on handheld or other portable devices. The developed techniques facilitate the capture, encoding and use of gesture streams for rendering of a musical performance. In some embodiments, a gesture stream encoding facilitates audible rendering of the musical performance locally on the portable device on which the musical performance is captured, typically in real time. In some embodiments, a gesture stream efficiently codes the musical performance for transmission from the portable device on which the musical performance is captured to (or toward) a remote device on which the musical performance is (or can be) rendered. Indeed, is some embodiments, a gesture stream so captured and encoded may be rendered both locally and on remote devices using substantially identical or equivalent instances of a digital synthesis of the musical instrument executing on the local and remote devices.
