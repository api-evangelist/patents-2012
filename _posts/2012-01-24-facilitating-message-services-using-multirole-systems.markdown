title: Facilitating message services using multi-role systems
abstract: Systems, methods, and software are provided for facilitating a message service. A multi-role system is identified based on where an active message database associated with a user identity resides. Service communications generated by a messaging client associated with the user identity are directed from an entry system to the multi-role system for handling in the multi-role system by a messaging server and a content server to provide the message service.

Aspects of the disclosure are related to communication services and in particular to highly reliable and scalable messaging services.

In the fields of computing and communications users have become accustomed to ubiquitous access to their messages and messaging services. For instance email can now be accessed on nearly any kind of communication device from almost any location. Likewise unified communication technologies allow users to take and place phone calls and check voicemail through a variety of platforms often integrated with their email.

Providing such high levels of availability and reliability at scale requires coordination across many systems and processes which alone is a difficult task. Added to this are the challenges of keeping up with evolving technology and increased expectations. For example users have come to expect access to messaging services not just from any device or location but at any time and with the same rich features and responsiveness.

In response some messaging services have evolved very complex architectures to provide these levels of availability and reliability. However as services scale such complexity can frustrate the development and deployment of new features and hinder maintenance and updates. For example some email services call for very modular architectures that distribute messaging servers and content servers and their associated roles across diverse sets of server systems. While these modular arrangements have many advantages they can lead to so much inter server communication that a problem with just one component can negatively impact many others thereby leading to sub optimal user experiences.

Provided herein are systems methods and software that improve messaging services by utilizing multi role systems having messaging servers and content servers residing therein to provide the messaging services to clients. Affinity is achieved by routing service communications via entry systems to the appropriate multi role systems based on where messages associated with users may reside. Deploying multi role systems allows for high availability and reliability while accommodating maintenance and upgrades.

This Overview is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Technical Disclosure. It should be understood that this Overview is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Implementations described herein provide for highly available and reliable messaging services at scale using multi role systems that have both messaging servers and content servers integrated therein. Deploying messaging servers and content servers that reside together in the same multi role systems reduces overall complexity in the messaging architecture while enforcing affinity across the messaging service for any given client. Indeed multiple versions of and changes to a messaging service can be supported in a reliable manner by way of the multi role systems without requiring overly complex validation processes.

For example in some implementations email clients are directed to the appropriate multi role system based on where among the multi role systems their mailboxes that can be accessed are located. In an active passive replication system the same multi role system that hosts a user s active mailbox thus also hosts the protocol server and mailbox server that will provide the messaging service to the user. In this manner any given multi role system or components within it can be upgraded or taken out of service without impacting numerous other surrounding systems. Rather the accessible or active mailbox for a user is merely shifted to a new multi role system typically by designation which will also contain the necessary protocol server and mailbox server necessary to provide the messaging service to the user.

Affinity occurs naturally in the implementations disclosed herein because the messaging server is selected based on where a user s messages reside and only that messaging server is involved with a given session for the user. In other words the messaging client will communicate with a single messaging server during a session instead of potentially distributing functions of the messaging server across several messaging servers. For example sending and receiving functions will both be handled by the same messaging server instead of distributing sending and receiving onto separate messaging servers.

In addition the messaging server and the content server are both hosted by or even stored internally to the same multi role system as where the client s message database is hosted or stored improving affinity between the messaging server and the content server. Just as the client need only communicate with one messaging server likewise the content server need only communicate with the same messaging server. In fact the messaging server content server and message database may be stored on the same physical disk or memory apparatus or stored in a distributed fashion across multiple storage devices. Thus affinity is naturally enforced since many communications involving the protocol and mailbox elements will necessarily remain internal to the selected multi role system.

Some implementations may also provide load balancing functionality within the entry systems that balance workloads across many entry servers within the entry systems. In addition for any given operation or connection different load balancers and different entry serves may be utilized since affinity between the messaging servers and the content servers will occur within the multi role systems. In this manner clients will be provided with highly available and highly reliable access to messaging services.

Referring now to illustrated is messaging system . Messaging system includes client and client operated by user and user respectively to obtain access to and use a messaging service provided by the various elements of messaging system . Upon invocation of the messaging service name system directs clients and to any of entry system entry system and entry system . Clients and may be any messaging clients capable of interfacing with name systems entry systems and multi role systems including desktop based messaging applications web based messaging applications mobile messaging applications and any variation or combination thereof.

Entry systems and provide functionality to interface between clients and and any of multi role system multi role system and multi role system . For instance entry systems and may handle client requests and provide network layer functionality including network security authentication and management of address endpoints. Other functionality may also be provided by entry systems and such as connection re direction and proxy functions. It should be understood that each entry system may be representative of a group of entry servers co located together within a geographic site. In such a case a load balancer may be present to balance communications across the entry servers. For example entry system includes network load balancer NLB entry server entry server and entry server . It should be understood that more than one network load balancer may be present within entry system . Likewise three entry servers are shown merely for illustrative purposes.

Multi role systems and include messaging servers and respectively and content servers and respectively. Messaging servers and interact with their respective content servers and to provide the message service to clients and as will be discussed in more detail below.

In particular messaging servers and may be any severs capable of engaging in common messaging functions such as sending and receiving messages. This may involve providing protocol functionality such accepting connections from and communicating with clients in accordance with various messaging protocols such as the Post Office Protocol POP Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP Outlook Web App OWA Exchange Control Panel ECP or ActiveSync messaging protocols. Messaging servers and may also provide other protocol functionality such as handling Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMPT or Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI communications. Any variation of these protocols as well as any other protocol may also be supported by messaging servers and .

Content servers and may engage in common content store functions such as hosting message databases providing message storage handling messaging policies managing address books indexing messages data protection and handling records management and retention policies. Content servers and may communicate with messaging servers and but may also communicate with other elements of messaging system such as clients and . In general content servers and access messages stored within message databases and on behalf of requesting entities such as messaging servers and .

It should be understood that the large scale at which messaging system could be deployed may involve tens if not hundreds of millions of users. Thus messaging system may be scaled to involve as many name systems entry systems and multi role systems as required to facilitate messaging services at a very large scale. depicts a limited number of clients name systems entry servers multi role systems and other elements merely for purposes of clarity.

The following will now discuss the implementation of process in . Beginning with step an entry system is selected based on client location. For instance client or may communicate with name system to invoke the messaging service. Name system then selects one of entry system and and directs the initiating client to the selected entry system. It is possible to identify more than one entry system to the client in the event that the primary entry system is unavailable the client can gain access by way of another entry system. In this example entry system is selected for client and entry system is selected for client . Directing the initiating client to the selected entry system may include identifying the network load balancer to the initiating client.

Once in communication with a network load balancer the initiating client is directed to an available entry server at step . For instance with respect to client network load balancer may select any of entry servers and depending on a variety of factors such as the load allocated to each entry server the health of each entry server and possibly other factors. It is assumed for exemplary purposes that network load balancer has selected entry server . It should be understood that that a network load balancer not shown within entry system may provide the same functionality with respect to client by identifying any of a number of entry servers not shown within entry system . However it should also be understood that the architecture provided with respect to entry system is merely optional. For instance network load balancers and multiple entry servers are optional and need not be implemented within every entry system.

At step the selected entry server identifies a multi role system based on where a message database resides that will be associated with a user. A message database resides where it is physically stored such as on a disk or disk array or some other type of storage device or memory apparatus within a multi role system.

For example any of entry system and or the sub systems or severs within them can select any of multi role systems and depending upon where the message database linked to the requesting user is stored. The association between users and message databases may be determined based on user identities client identities and the like and may be influenced based on the state of each database or multi role system on which it resides. In this example it is assumed that message database is associated with user while message database is associated with user . Accordingly multi role system is selected for client and multi role system is selected for client .

Once the multi role system has been selected step calls for maintaining affinity between the selected messaging server content server and the messaging client. Initially this is accomplished by the selection of a multi role system that includes the content server attached to the active message database for the subject user. Since each multi role system also includes a messaging server affinity between the messaging server and the client is also provided. In other words by providing both a messaging server and a content server within a single system entity the multi role system affinity between the client and the messaging and content servers that provide the message service occurs effortlessly. This is because the messaging server is selected based on the location of active message database for the user. Note that the active message database may sometimes be understood to contain the active mailbox for a user and thus the multi role system may be considered to be selected based on the location of the active mailbox. In addition in some environments the term message database is used synonymously with mailbox. In either case the location of the user s active message database or mailbox governs which multi role system is selected.

On an ongoing basis then affinity is maintained by continuously ensuring that at least both the messaging server function and the content server function are provided within the same physical system as that which stores the active message database for the user. Should the location of active message database change then so too would which messaging server and which content server are involved in providing the message service to the client as will be discussed in more detail with respect to and .

Name system proceeds to select an entry point based on the location of client . It should be understood that more than one entry point may be identified to client . Typically name system attempts to select an entry point that is geographically relevant to the location of client . For instance the relative proximity of an entry system to client compared to the proximity of other entry system may drive the selection of that entry system. In this example entry system is chosen over entry system and entry system and name system directs client to it accordingly. Name system may identify entry system to client by referring to a particular network load balancer or group of network load balancers within entry system . In this example it is assumed that network load balancer is identified to client .

Having been directed to entry system client proceeds to generate and transfer an access request to network load balancer . It should be understood that a single access request is shown here merely for exemplary purposes. It is possible that client may initiate multiple access requests to multiple network load balancers within entry system for example in a round robin fashion before ultimately engaging with network load balancer . It should also be understood that while the same network load balancer may be used across several operations or connections attempted by client it is possible that a different network load balancer is available for different operations or connections.

The access request identifies user perhaps by a user identifier so that entry server can select a multi role system based on where a message database associated with the user resides. In this example message database associated with user resides in multi role system . Accordingly entry server directs the access request to messaging server within multi role system for further processing. It should be understood that entry server need not perform the step of selecting an appropriate multi role system in response to every instance of service communications provided by client . Rather the appropriate multi role system would be identified at least at times when the appropriate multi role system had not yet been identified.

Messaging server responsively engages with client and handles service communications to provide the messaging service to user Likewise messaging server may engage with content server as part of providing the messaging service.

As further illustrated in which entry server is employed to facilitate communications between client and the appropriate multi role system may change based on loading decisions made by network load balancer . For example while client may initially communicate with multi role system via entry server subsequently client may be directed to entry server . This could occur in response to another access request made by client but could occur in response to other types of communications made by client .

Having selected a new entry server service communications are exchanged between client and entry server . Entry server identifies or otherwise selects the appropriate multi role system with which to communicate based on where a message database associated with user resides which for purposes of illustration is assumed to have remained multi role system . Accordingly entry server communicates with multi role system to facilitate exchange of service communications with client . It should be understood that entry server need not perform the step of selecting an appropriate multi role system in response to every instance of service communications provided by client . Rather the appropriate multi role system would be identified at least at times when the appropriate multi role system had not yet been identified.

In a portion of messaging system from is illustrated pertaining to the delivery of the message service to client . Message database contains shading to represent that a change has occurred causing the active database designation for user to shift from message database to a different message database. The change may occur due to a failure of message database messaging server content server or any of the underlying components or sub systems within multi role system . Alternatively multi role system may intentionally be brought out of service temporarily to allow for updates or version changes.

In this example message database is designated as the new active database for user in response to the status change. The designation of message database as the new active database may occur based on any number of factors that are well understood and need not be discussed at length here. One possible factor is the role served by message database as a passive backup to message database . It should be understood that while message databases and are depicted as single database elements they could be part of a larger data store that may contain other databases or may themselves contain other databases within.

Turning to as a result of the shift in the active designation from message database to message database entry system maintains affinity by directing service communications to multi role system . Within multi role system reside messaging server and content server which can handle service communications in the context of providing the message service to client and user .

It should be understood that redirecting to multi role system away from multi role system provides for rapid recovery in the event of failure or servicing of any elements of multi role system . In addition consistent versioning may be enforced within each multi role system such that when a client is redirected to a new multi role system the elements within the multi role system will each be of the same version relative to one another. The messaging clients may then be provided with different versions of a service seamlessly since the underlying components of the multi role systems will be of a consistent version. This means that availability and reliability of the messaging service will increase since interworking between messaging servers and content servers of inconsistent versions is unlikely to occur.

Note that the same entry system is used to direct the communications from client . This may be done by redirecting the communications but entry system may also serve as a proxy. Entry system may be notified of the shift in active designation by content server messaging server or some other element running within multi role system as well as any other element or process that monitors the state of databases within multi role systems and and . Entry system may itself perform a monitoring process that actively checks on the status of various elements within multi role systems and so as to maintain the necessary intelligence required to provide affinity between client and client and whichever messaging servers and content servers are involved in providing the messaging service.

Referring now to a portion of messaging system from is illustrated to provide an example of version control between multi role systems. In particular illustrates a scenario whereby user operating client requires access to multiple message databases. This may occur for example when a user has been delegated authority over or access to another person s messages. In such circumstances the other person s messages may reside within a multi role system different than the multi role system within which the primary user s messages reside.

With respect to client is initially directed through entry system to multi role system as discussed at length above. For most operations such as sending and receiving email on behalf of user client needs access to message database and thus no intercommunication between multi role systems is required. However client may wish to interact with items stored within message data base such as email or calendar entries associated with another person.

When such a scenario is triggered messaging server may attempt to establish a connection or otherwise communicate with messaging server . For example messaging server may attempt to initiate communications by way of any number of protocols such as the web services WS SMTP or MAPI protocols. However versioning control can be enforced by limiting which protocol is used to communicate between multi role systems. In this example the WS and SMTP protocols are allowed while MAPI protocol is not allowed.

Which protocols are allowed and which protocols are not allowed may be determined based on a number of factors such as how well each protocol supports version protection. Version protection ensures that even if multi role system are communicating with each other using different versions of the same protocol communications are likely to be exchanged successfully since later versions will be interoperable with older versions of the protocol. Unfortunately some protocols are less version protected than others which can results in communication failures between systems communicating using different versions of the same protocol. Thus multi role system and the sub systems and servers within it can be limited from communicating with other multi role systems via protocols other than those considered acceptable from a version protection standpoint.

Referring still to once a connection has been successfully established between messaging server and messaging server communications can commence in accordance with commands initiated by user via client . For example user may send or receive messages on behalf of the other person that has delegated control to user . In the case of a send or receive operation messages would flow to or from multi role system over the established connection with multi role system . Messaging server would send or receive the messages which would ultimately be communicated to message database and stored on behalf of the delegating user.

Affinity level includes entry system entry system and entry system . Entry systems and interface between messaging client and any of multi role system multi role system and multi role system to handle client requests and provide network layer functionality including network security authentication and management of address endpoints. Entry systems and may provide other functionality such as connection re direction and proxy functions. It should be understood that each entry system may be representative of a group of entry systems co located together within a geographic site. In such a case a load balancer may be present to balance communications across the entry systems.

Affinity level functions to maintain session affinity between messaging client and messaging level . This is accomplished by determining the targeted mailbox for a user and directing access either by redirect or proxy to the appropriate multi role system hosting the mailbox. If a load balancer is present affinity in the load balancer need only occur at the network or transport level since each entry server within a group of servers behind the load balancer will examine and direct client communications independently rather than depending upon state full mechanisms or interaction with any other entry servers.

While illustrated only with respect to entry system each entry system includes an entry server such as entry server . Entry server interacts with location service in messaging level to service access requests and other service communications initiated by messaging client running on client device . Examples of roles performed by entry server include perimeter security role and proxy services role . Entry server maintains affinity between messaging client and messaging level as will be discussed in more detail below.

Messaging level includes multi role systems and which include messaging servers and content servers. By way of example multi role system includes messaging server and content server . Messaging server interacts with entry server content server and messaging client to provide the messaging service to user . Messaging server content server and active database may be stored on the same physical disk or memory apparatus within multi role system or stored in a distributed fashion across multiple storage devices within multi role system . Thus affinity is enforced naturally since many communications involving mailbox messaging server and content server will remain internal to multi role system .

Examples of roles performed by messaging server include protocol server role and transport hub role . Messaging server provides common messaging functions such as sending and receiving messages. Messaging server generally performs protocol functions such as accepting connections from and communicating with clients in accordance with various messaging protocols such POP IMAP or ActiveSync. Messaging server may provide other protocol functionality such as handling SMTP or MAPI traffic.

Examples of roles performed by content server include a mailbox server role and a protection role . Mailbox server role may function to host message databases provide message storage handle messaging policies manage address books index messages and handle records management and retention policies. Mailbox server role may communicate with messaging server and may also communicate with other elements of messaging system such as client . Messaging server operates on active database through content server . Active database includes mailbox associated with user . Active database can be replicated to corresponding passive databases and as governed by protection role .

It should be understood that depicts a limited number of clients name systems entry servers multi role systems and other elements merely for purposes of clarity. Messaging system may be deployed at a very large scale involving tens or hundreds of millions of users. Thus messaging system can be scaled to accommodate as many name systems entry system and multi role systems as required to facilitate messaging services at such scale. An example of a message service is Microsoft Exchange.

Now referring to the sequences illustrated in the following will discuss the operation of messaging system in an example. Beginning at time T messaging client invokes the messaging service by transferring a request that includes the identity of the service to name server running on name system . For instance messaging client may transfer a uniform resource locator that specifies an address for the messaging service such as www.outlook.com. The request may also identify messaging client or client device in some manner that allows name server to determine their location.

Name server can then query entry point database at time Tfor an appropriate entry point that is determined based on the location of messaging client . For example the network address assigned to messaging client or client device may be resolvable to a physical location or geographic area. Alternatively entry point database may simply associate various entry points with various ranges of network addresses that are provisioned based on known location characteristics.

At time Tname server directs messaging client to communicate with the selected entry system which in this example is assumed to be entry system . Name server may return a single entry point to messaging client . Optionally name server may provide messaging client with a list of multiple entry points. Messaging client can then attempt to access each entry point as necessary thereby providing access redundancy to messaging client .

Once directed to an appropriate entry system messaging client at time Ttransfers an access request to entry server to obtain access to the messaging service. The access request or other communications commensurate with it identify user to entry server . Entry server queries location service at time Twith the identity of user to determine where among multi role systems and an active database associated with user resides. Location service returns the identity of the proper multi role system associated with the active database for user which in this case is multi role system within which resides active database .

Location service may communicate with other elements within messaging level to determine and store the identity of multi role systems in association with which active or passive databases are contained within them. This information can be updated to reflect changes that occur. For instance one active database that resides in one multi role server may fail or other components of the multi role server may fail. In response a corresponding passive database can be elected or designated as the new active database. Location service would then be updated to indicate that a new multi role system is associated with the new active database. It should be noted that location service may instead of or in addition to storing the identity of multi role systems in association with messaging systems store the identity of particular mailboxes such as mailbox in association with the multi role systems. Location service may also optionally track the health of multi role systems and and consider those factors when allocating multi role systems to clients.

At time Tentry server directs service communications including possibly an access request to messaging server which resides in multi role system . It should be understood that entry server may act as a proxy for communications exchanged between messaging client and multi role system but may also redirect messaging client to communicate with multi role system .

In any case messaging client commences to exchange service communications with messaging server . Messaging server receives the service communications and handles them in the context of providing the messaging service. For example messaging server may handle requests by messaging client to send receive or otherwise perform messaging operations on messages stored in mailbox . Performing these functions may require interacting with content server to obtain information contained in active database such as to retrieve or store individual mail messages. Any responses or replies that may be required of messaging server to messaging client can be transferred and delivered through entry system as shown at times Tand T or possibly communicated directly to messaging client .

Turning now to illustrated is an exemplary computing environment representative of the computing environments in which messaging systems and may be implemented. In particular computing environment includes client device entry system and multi role system . Client device is representative of any type of client device that may implement a messaging client such as clients and as well as client device . Entry system is representative of entry systems and and entry systems and .

Client device entry system and multi role system may each be any type of computing system capable of performing as described herein for client devices entry servers and messaging servers respectively such as a server computer client computer internet appliance or any combination or variation thereof. Examples of client device include personal computers mobile phones and internet appliances as well as any other type of device capable of running a messaging client. Indeed client device entry system and multi role system may each be implemented as a single computing system but may also be implemented in a distributed manner across multiple computing systems. Client device entry system and multi role system are provided as examples of general purpose computing systems that when implementing process discussed with respect to or otherwise functioning as described for messaging systems and become a specialized messaging system.

Client device entry system and multi role system have some elements in common including processing systems and storage systems and and communication interfaces and .

Processing systems and are communicatively coupled with storage systems and respectively. Storage systems and store messaging client entry server messaging server and content server respectively. When executed by processing systems and messaging client entry server messaging server and content server direct client device entry system and multi role system operate as described herein for messaging systems and and their respective elements.

Referring still to processing systems and may comprise microprocessors and other circuitry that retrieve and execute messaging client entry server messaging server and content server from storage systems and respectively.

Storage systems and may comprise additional elements such as controllers capable of communicating with processing systems and .

Examples of storage media include random access memory read only memory magnetic disks optical disks and flash memory as well as any combination or variation thereof or any other type of storage media. In some implementations the storage media may be a non transitory storage media. In some implementations at least a portion of the storage media may be transitory. It should be understood that in no case is the storage media a propagated signal.

Messaging client entry server messaging server and content server comprise computer program instructions firmware or some other form of machine readable processing instructions having at least portions of process embodied therein. Messaging client entry server and messaging and content servers and may each be implemented as a single application but also as multiple applications. In general messaging client entry server messaging server and content server when loaded into processing systems and and executed transform client device entry system and multi role system from general purpose computing systems into special purpose computing systems customized to operate as described for messaging systems and and their associated discussion.

Encoding on media messaging client entry server messaging server and content server may also transform the physical structure of storage systems and . The specific transformation of the physical structure may depend on various factors in different implementations of this description. Examples of such factors may include but are not limited to the technology used to implement the storage media of storage systems and whether the computer storage media are characterized as primary or secondary storage and the like.

For example if the computer storage media are implemented as semiconductor based memory messaging client entry server messaging server and content server may transform the physical state of the semiconductor memory when the software is encoded therein. For example messaging client entry server messaging server and content server may transform the state of transistors capacitors or other discrete circuit elements constituting the semiconductor memory.

A similar transformation may occur with respect to magnetic or optical media. Other transformations of physical media are possible without departing from the scope of the present description with the foregoing examples provided only to facilitate this discussion.
