Referring to device comprises a chassis that supports a display . Display can comprise one or more light emitters such as an array of light emitting diodes LED liquid crystals plasma cells or organic light emitting diodes OLED . Other types of light emitters are contemplated. A touch membrane is overlaid on display to thereby provide an input device for device . As a non limiting example device can be configured to selectively show or hide a virtual keyboard . Other types of input devices other than touch membrane or in addition to touch membrane are contemplated. For example a physical keyboard or touch pad or joystick or trackball or track wheel a microphone or optical camera or any one or more of them can be provided in addition to or in lieu of touch membrane . Such other components may if desired be slide out components. In a present implementation device also comprises a speaker for generating audio output but speaker is optional.

Processor in turn is also configured to control display and speaker and any other output devices that may be provided in device also in accordance with different programming instructions and responsive to different input receive from the input devices.

Processor also connects to a network interface which can be implemented in a present embodiment as a radio configured to communicate over a wireless link although in variants device can also include a network interface for communicating over a wired link. Network interface can thus be generalized as a further input output device that can be utilized by processor to fulfill various programming instructions which involve communicating over a network via the link. It will be understood that interface is configured to correspond with the network architecture that defines such a link. Present commonly employed network architectures for such a link include but are not limited to Global System for Mobile communication GSM General Packet Relay Service GPRS Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution EDGE 3G High Speed Packet Access HSPA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EVDO Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers IEEE standard 802.11 Bluetooth or any of their variants or successors. It is also contemplated each network interface can include multiple radios to accommodate the different protocols that may be used to simultaneously or individually communicate over different types of links.

As will become apparent further below device can be implemented with different configurations than described omitting certain input devices or including extra input devices and likewise omitting certain output devices or including extra input devices.

In a present embodiment device is also configured to maintain within non volatile storage a messaging composition interface MCI application and one or more messaging applications . . . . Collectively these are referred to as messaging applications and generically each are referred to as messaging application . This nomenclature is used elsewhere herein. While MCI application contains the term application it is to be understood that MCI application can be implemented in a variety of different types of software objects such as for example a software function or a software process or a software environment. Non volatile storage may also maintain one or more additional applications such as a calendar a phone application or any app . Application applications and applications can be pre stored in non volatile storage upon manufacture of device or downloaded via network interface and saved on non volatile storage at any time subsequent to manufacture of device .

As will be explained further below MCI application can be integrated with existing messaging applications such as Email Instant Messaging Short Message Service SMS and internal messaging applications within social messaging environments such as Facebook Twitter Foursquare and Google . MCI application can be used to interact with other devices that are also configured to execute their own messaging applications and such devices can include their own instance of MCI application .

Processor is configured to execute MCI application messaging applications and other applications accessing non volatile storage and volatile storage as needed.

A plurality of ways to implement MCI application is contemplated. Referring now to however an example configuration for MCI application and messaging applications during execution on processor are shown in greater detail. MCI application comprises a graphical engine a processing engine and a plurality of programming interfaces . Graphical engine comprises programming instructions for controlling display and for receiving input from touch membrane . Processing engine comprises amongst other things an intermediation layer between graphical engine and programming interfaces . Graphical engine therefore operates under the control of processing engine and is generally agnostic to the particular messaging applications that can connect to MCI application . Programming interfaces are each configured to communicate with processing engine and messaging applications . Each programming interface is uniquely configured on the one hand to communicate with each unique messaging application and on the other hand each programming interface is commonly configured to communicate with processing engine . It is contemplated that an integrated development environment or other programming tool or for device can include a development tool for creating additional programming interfaces such that as new messaging services are conceived and as new messaging applications corresponding to those new messaging services are deployed then MCI application can remain the basis for the common graphical interface on device .

In one implementation it is also contemplated that because of MCI application each messaging application can be provided on device without including its own native graphical interface for both entering messaging content and also reading messaging content as is the current common practice. In this manner programming resources are conserved on device without sacrificing the ability to access the broadly available range of messaging services via messaging applications . In another implementation one or more messaging applications can be provided with its own native graphical interface but processing and memory resources can still be conserved by not executing two or more of them in favour of using the single interface offered by MCI application .

Referring now to a flowchart depicting a method for messaging on an electronic device is indicated generally at . Method is one way in which MCI application can be implemented. It is to be emphasized however that method can be performed on variations of device and MCI application and need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown hence the elements of method are referred to herein as blocks rather than steps .

Block comprises loading a messaging composition interface. Example performance of block is represented in wherein the graphical interface of graphical engine of MCI application is shown as being generated on display under the control of processor . In the non limiting example of graphical engine shows a virtual keyboard a plurality of recipient fields a subject field and a composition field .

At this point it is to be highlighted that the contents of display are generated under the control of processor . However for convenience in the subsequent Figures only the contents of display are shown in isolation from display processor and device in general but it is to be understood such components are contemplated as being used to generate the contents shown in these subsequent Figures.

Block thus comprises loading programming interfaces. In the context of the specific example discussed in relation to block contemplates loading of programming interfaces into processor for execution. Block comprises establishing a connection with messaging applications. In the context of the specific example discussed in relation to block contemplates establishing a communication pathway between each programming interface and its respective message application .

As a result of performance of block and block processing engine dynamically configures graphical engine to generate a menu of choices of various messaging services associated with various message applications . shows this example as graphical engine is shown as generating a plurality of choices of messaging services . The view in can be achieved in a variety of ways that can be decided upon implementation of these teachings but as a non limiting example a swipe gesture from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen in the view of could be used to invoke the view shown in . In each shown messaging service is associated with a particular message application . In the example of six message services are shown. Message service is labeled Desktop to represent desktop email service. Message service is labeled Twitter to represent a link to a Twitter account for broadcasting short text messages to followers of the Twitter account linked to message service . Facebook service is labeled Facebook to represent a link to a Facebook account for broadcasting status messages to friends of the Facebook account linked to message service . In a variation Facebook service can represent a link to the electronic mail messaging service offered within each Facebook account whereby the Facebook account holder can use the Facebook account to send personal and unique electronic mail messages to other Facebook users . SMS MMS service is labeled SMS MMS to represent a link to an SMS MMS account for sending either short messages or multimedia messages via the SMS MMS service associated with a telephone number that is typically associated with device . BBM service is labeled BBM to represent a link to a BlackBerry Message account for sending instant messages via a BlackBerry service. However it is to be understood that other types of instant message services could be provided in lieu of or in addition to the BBM service. Gmail service is labeled Gmail to represent a link to a Google Email Message account for sending email messages via a email servers hosted by Google Inc. However it is to be understood that other types of email message accounts could be provided in lieu of or in addition to the Gmail service such as Hotmail or Yahoo mail or the like.

At this point it can be noted that while six example message services are shown in any number of possible message services are possible and this fact is illustrated by the use of n to denote message application . To keep with the example in the example mapping in Table I will be used between services and applications .

Block comprises selecting messaging service s . In one implementation a single messaging service is selected at block by depressing a region of display adjacent to a desired one of the messaging services shown in .

 In other implementations of block a plurality of messaging services can be selected whereby received content discussed further below is eventually sent via one or more of the selected messaging services . In such other implementations device can be configured to send over all of the selected messaging services or to only send to recipients that have accounts associated with the selected messaging services . This will be discussed in greater detail below. In other embodiments still device can be configured to determine a subset of available messaging services available to the addressee and only permit the selection of the available messaging services. 

Block comprises adjusting the MCI to conform with the selected messaging services from block . Block is optional but can be included where the different messaging services rely on different graphical interfaces. For example an SMS or BBM interface contemplates a chat interface with a composition frame as well as a sent frame and a received frame. This example will be discussed further below.

Block comprises receiving content via the MCI. Block thus contemplates receiving text input or the like e.g. a voice note or an attachment that reflects the actual content which will be delivered to addressees that will be specified in recipients fields . Such text input or other content can be placed within composition field . Block also contemplates receiving data that populates the subject field .

Block comprises receiving input indicative of a destination for the message. In the present embodiment the input indicative of a destination for the message is represented by an addressee. Block thus contemplates populating of recipient fields with addresses for intended recipients of the content received at block . In certain implementations it is contemplated that block contemplates an interface or other linkage between a contact management application that is also maintained on device . Such a linkage can be configured to only offer addressee recipients that have addresses that match the type of service selected at block . Alternatively such a linkage can make all addressees available but either prevent their selection or if they are selected an exception warning or other error message can be generated on display indicating that the selected recipient has no address that matches the selected service. In still further variations the selection of multiple recipients can lead to generation of a message that suggests which service should be selected at block to maximize the number of recipients that have addresses corresponding to suggested service.

Block comprises determining if all message composing is done. If no then method returns to block . It is to be appreciated that if content received via the MCI from block or received an addressee via the MCI from block a return to block will select a messaging service again. It is contemplated that the content and the addressee can be preserved or deleted. For example if a different service is selected block if present can adjust the MCI. However it is contemplated that in some embodiments the content is preserved and re presented in a second graphical interface. Similarly it is also contemplated that in some embodiments the addressee is preserved and re presented in a second graphical interface. It is also contemplated that in some embodiments the addresses in the recipient fields can be automatically updated to correspond with the address of the addressee in the other service.

Furthermore block and block can receive further content and addressees using the second graphical interface as well as allow the content and addressees to be edited. For example an addressed message may be changed to a broadcast message. In another example an email service composed can be changed to a status update to BBM or Facebook or a broadcasted tweet. In other examples the change can be within a particular service such as a direct BBM message can become a status update within BBM or vice versa.

In certain implementations a yes determination can be made at block when a send command is received such as by depressing a virtual button on display by graphical engine that is labeled Send . Such a virtual button can be configured to be available only upon satisfaction of a validation sequence such as to verify that selected messaging services at block conform with selected recipients at block .

A no determination can be made in any instance where a yes determination is not satisfied at block . For example a no determination can include receiving further input indicating that the message is not to be sent. In another example a no determination can be made after the expiration of a period of time without activity.

At this point it can be emphasized that the exact sequence of blocks in method is not by any means limited to the sequence shown. By way of a specific non limiting example on this point it is contemplated that inputs received at block block block and block can all be effected in any sequence during interaction with graphical engine . In this manner a message can be iteratively composed to ultimately facilitate reception of a fully composed message its recipients and desired message service. Furthermore although the present embodiment returns to block upon a no determination it is also contemplated that the method can return to any one of block block block and block .

The person skilled in the art will now recognize that method device and their variants can have many different implementations. For example shows an example of how block can be implemented. In four screens are shown in an example sequence that can be generated by graphical engine in response to input are shown. Screen is generally analogous to the view shown in . Screen also shows a screen press on virtual keyboard representing entering of the text Kar in the recipient field representing a portion of the name of the addressee. Based on the portion of the name the MCI can be configured to recommend possible recipients. For example screen shows a list of possible recipients matching the text Kar and a screen press beside the contact Karla Jones . In other embodiments the list of possible recipients can also include additional contacts based on a history of associated recipients. Screen shows Karla Jones as an added recipient. Screen shows the addition of another recipient Rob Lee to illustrate that multiple recipients can be added.

As another example shows an example of how block can be implemented. In four additional screens are shown in an example sequence that can be generated by graphical engine in response to input. Screen contemplates a screen press over the subject field bringing the cursor focus to the subject field. Screen also shows a screen press on virtual keyboard representing entering of the text Meeting with cust in the subject field . Screen also shows a screen press on virtual keyboard representing entering of the text into the composition field . Screen also shows a screen press on virtual keyboard and an instruction to hide the virtual keyboard so the full body of the message is visible.

It can be noted that screen omits inclusion of a Send virtual button but screen screen and screen all include a Send Button. It will now be understood that the omission of the Send button in screen leads to an automatic no determination at block . Likewise a no determination is made on screen screen and screen unless the Send button is actually depressed.

As another example shows another example of how block block block and block can be implemented. In four additional screens are shown in an example sequence that can be generated by graphical engine in response to input. Screen corresponds to block and contemplates a screen press to select BBM as the message service which in this case represents BlackBerry Messenger instant message service but can also represent SMS MMS or any other similar instant message or text message or chat service. Screen corresponds to block and contemplates the selection of Adam Jones as an addressee. Screen corresponds to block and contemplates the reception of content and screen press on screen represents pressing Send to thereby satisfy the yes condition at block and leading to block at which point the instant message is sent. Screen represents modification of the MCI to a format consistent with instant message service to thereby show chat history and to show the dialogue between the sender and recipient. In other embodiments screen can include a history of previous message such as a chat history if the history is available for the addressee.

At this point it can be noted that the example in also contemplates invocation of block whereby the appearance of the MCI is modified to correspond with the type of selected messaging service. It can also be noted that in one implementation the entire performance of the example in is performed entirely within MCI application but that in another implementation screen screen and screen can be performed within MCI application but that screen can be performed within BBM application whereby an the BBM message application and its corresponding graphical interface is automatically invoked after or as part of block such that the data received at block block and block is passed through to the BBM message application and thereafter BBM message application is fully invoked and the graphical interface of BBM message application is used thereafter for the remainder of the chat session.

Referring now to a flowchart depicting a method for adjusting the graphical interface on an electronic device is indicated generally at . Method is one way in which a MCI application can change the graphical interface such as in block . In addition method can also be used to provide data to the MCI such as the addressee data or content. It is to be emphasized however that method can be performed on variations of device and MCI application and need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown hence the elements of method are referred to herein as blocks rather than steps .

Block comprises generating a graphical interface. In the present embodiment a graphical interface is generated on display . Graphical interfaces can be stored on non volatile storage unit and loaded depending on the messaging service selected.

Block comprises receiving recipients via the graphical interface. In the present embodiment the recipients are identified and correspond to the addressee. Block comprises receiving content via the graphical interface.

Block comprises selecting an interface based on the messaging service. For example an SMS or BBM interface contemplates a chat interface with a composition frame as well as a sent frame and a received frame. This chat set of screens allows for efficient rendering of a large number of short messages simulating a two way conversation which is typical for these types of messaging services. For other services such as email one way screens may be used. Furthermore it is also contemplated that in some embodiments the graphical interface for a service can be modified to adjust preferences associated with the graphical interface.

Block comprises selecting a second service associated with a second graphical interface. Subsequently block comprises adjusting the graphical interface to conform with the selected messaging services from block .

While the foregoing provides certain non limiting example embodiments it should be understood that combinations subsets and variations of the foregoing are contemplated. For example it is contemplated that method can be modified to ultimately send the same content via multiple different message services according to message services that are actually available for a selected addressee. For example if Andrew and Dolly are selected as addresses but Andrew only has an email account and Dolly only has a Facebook account then method can be modified to send content at block to Andrew via email and to Dolly via Facebook.

While specific embodiments have been described and illustrated such embodiments should be considered illustrative only and should not serve to limit the accompanying claims.
