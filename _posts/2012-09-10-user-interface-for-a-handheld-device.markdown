The present patent document relates generally to user interface design and more particularly to the design of user interfaces for applications running on handheld communication devices.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

Handheld devices such as Personal Digital Assistants PDAs cellular phones portable computing devices and other two way data and or voice communication devices are increasing in popularity as they have become more feature rich at an ever decreasing cost to the consumer. In particular handheld devices that allow both voice and data communication are almost indispensable tools in certain businesses and government agencies. The need to maintain electronic mail communication as well as a variety of related information management applications such as electronic calendars contacts and address books without impeding mobility are among the critical factors driving the demand for handheld communication devices. Popular handheld devices include those supplied by Research In Motion Ltd. of Waterloo Ontario Canada.

However some applications running on handheld devices may be cumbersome to use. This is partly due to the limitations of the hardware although user interface design also plays a part. Handheld devices must by definition be easily portable and convenient to carry around. This entails that the handheld devices must have a small form factor and be sufficiently light for mobile use. Unfortunately the small size of a mobile handheld device limits the available physical means for data entry data output and general interaction with a user. Both the data entry pad or keyboard and viewable screen size of a handheld device are necessarily small compared with personal computers or workstations. Moreover the use of a peripheral input device such as a mouse is awkward or impractical for handheld devices as the peripheral is often almost as large as the handheld itself. In addition handheld devices are often battery operated. Battery operated devices must pay particular attention to power consumption as power is a very limited resource. It is thus advantageous for power conservation purposes to minimize the number of components that consume power.

Therefore it is often challenging for applications running on handheld devices to offer user interface features that are as rich and as convenient to use as those offered by their counterparts running on PCs and workstations. PCs have much larger screens bigger keyboards and may easily use additional peripheral input devices such as a mouse. Conventional applications running on handheld devices thus typically offer user interfaces that are less familiar and may sometimes be confusing to use. Approaches to solve user interface problems have tended to focus on the design of small form factor keyboard layouts for optimal thumb based data entry such as the solution taught by U.S. Pat. No. 6 867 763 granted to Research In Motion Ltd.

However the visual aspects of data entry interfaces in handheld devices for common applications such as email client software still tend to be different from those offered by the desktop equivalents due primarily to the limitations of screen size. These differences in the user interfaces between handheld versions and desktop versions of similar applications are disadvantageous. For example the typical handheld user is almost always familiar with a desktop email client and is therefore likely to be inconvenienced by a user interface on a handheld that is very different. Further composing an email message using conventional email clients on handhelds often entails an excessive use of menu driven input. Accordingly there is a need for applications running on handheld devices that mimic some of the desirable aspects of user interfaces of corresponding desktop applications. Advantageously a better user interface would make handheld devices more convenient and enjoyable to use.

A handheld device and method for composing an email message to be sent over a wireless network environment is disclosed. In accordance with one aspect a method of operation of a handheld device is disclosed. According to the method upon receipt of a user request to compose an e mail a screen is displayed with a recipient field for a recipient address an associated label to indicate that the recipient field is for a recipient address and a message body field for holding message content. The method further includes upon each keystroke entry of text to the recipient field looking up entries from an address book which match the text and displaying a selection menu representing addresses from at least a portion of the entries. In accordance with another aspect a handheld device loaded with an email client is disclosed. The email client includes processor executable instructions that allow a user to compose an email message to send to a server computer over a network. The email client on the handheld device displays a screen with a recipient field for a recipient address an associated label to indicate that the recipient field is for a recipient address and a message body field for holding message content. The device further looks up entries from an address book which match text typed into the recipient field and displays a selection menu representing addresses from at least a portion of the entries.

A radio frequency RF base station provides a communication link between WAN which may be the public Internet and a communications network which may be a wireless network. Handheld device accesses data from server or desktop computer through the communications network and WAN . In some network architectures a firewall may be implemented between WAN and server computer to gate access to LAN which may be a corporate LAN.

Handheld device is loaded with email client software that accesses email messages stored in mail server software such as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino software running on server . To facilitate data access by handheld device server may be loaded with specialized software to provide compression encryption and a data interface with the mail server software.

The housing may be elongated vertically or may take on other sizes and shapes including clamshell housing structures . The keyboard may include a mode selection key or other hardware or software for switching between text entry and telephony entry.

In addition to the microprocessor other parts of the handheld device are shown schematically in . These include a communications subsystem a short range communications subsystem the keyboard and the display along with a trackwheel or trackball and other auxiliary input output devices a serial port a speaker and a microphone as well as memory devices including a flash memory and a random access memory RAM and various other device subsystems . As is known trackwheel may be rotated to provide scrolling and pressed to allow selection. The handheld device has a battery to power the active elements of the handheld device . The handheld device is preferably a two way radio frequency RF communication device having voice and or data communication capabilities. In addition the handheld device may have the capability to communicate with other computer systems via the Internet.

Operating system software executed by the microprocessor is preferably stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory but may be stored in other types of memory devices such as a read only memory ROM or similar storage element. In addition system software specific device applications or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Communication signals received by the handheld device may also be stored to the RAM .

The microprocessor in addition to its operating system functions enables execution of software applications on the handheld device . A predetermined set of software applications that control basic device operations such as a voice communications module A and a data communications module B are installed on the handheld device during manufacture. The data communications module B allows the handling of email messages. In addition a personal information manager PIM application module C is also installed on the handheld device during manufacture. The PIM application is capable of organizing and managing data items such as e mail calendar events voice mails appointments and task items. The PIM application is also capable of sending and receiving data items via wireless network . The data items managed by the PIM application are seamlessly integrated synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the device user s corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. As well additional software modules illustrated as other software modules N may be installed during manufacture.

Communication functions including data and voice communications are performed through the communication subsystem and possibly through the short range communications subsystem . The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and one or more antennas illustrated as a receive antenna and a transmit antenna . In addition the communication subsystem also includes a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP and local oscillators LOs . The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem is dependent upon the communication network in which the handheld device is intended to operate. For example the communication subsystem of the handheld device may be designed to operate with the Mobitex DataTAC or General Packet Radio Service GPRS mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service AMPS Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Personal Communications Service PCS Global System for Mobile Communications GSM etc. Other types of data and voice networks both separate and integrated may also be utilized with the handheld device .

Network access requirements vary depending upon the type of communication system. For example in the Mobitex and DataTAC networks handheld devices are registered on the network using a unique Personal Identification Number PIN associated with each device. In GPRS networks however network access is associated with a subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore requires a subscriber identity module commonly referred to as a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card in order to operate on a GPRS network.

When required network registration or activation procedures have been completed the handheld device may send and receive communication signals over the communication network . Signals received from the communication network by the receive antenna are routed to the receiver which provides for signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog to digital conversion of the received signal allows the DSP to perform more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner signals to be transmitted to the network are processed e.g. modulated and encoded by the DSP and are then provided to the transmitter for digital to analog conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the communication network or networks via the transmit antenna .

In addition to processing communication signals the DSP provides for control of the receiver and the transmitter . For example gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

In a data communication mode a received signal such as a text message or web page download is processed by the communication subsystem and is input to the microprocessor . The received signal is then further processed by the microprocessor for an output to the display or alternatively to some other auxiliary I O devices . A device user may also compose data items such as e mail messages using the keyboard a trackwheel as for example a thumbwheel and or some other auxiliary I O device such as a touchpad a rocker switch or some other type of input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over the communication network via the communication subsystem .

In a voice communication mode overall operation of the device is substantially similar to the data communication mode except that received signals are output to a speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the device . In addition the display may also be utilized in voice communication mode for example to display the identity of a calling party the duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The short range communications subsystem enables communication between the handheld device and other proximate systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communications subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

Handheld device when operating under the control of known software and device code firmware may be used to compose an electronic mail message to a recipient in the manner illustrated in . Variations in the sequence of actions such as the use of keyboard keys instead of the trackwheel or the optional use of popup menus to alter the sequence of user interface screens are possible.

With reference to along with startup screen of a known email application running on the handheld device includes icons which are allocated labels for example Messages Address book Calendar Compose Browser etc. Each of these icons typically launches a new appropriately tailored user interface screen on the display when selected by the user by way of the trackwheel or the keyboard . depicts an exemplary screenshot of a user interface screen displayed by a known handheld email client when the Compose icon is selected in . The depicted user interface includes a label an input field a drop down address selection list headed with a Use Once selection . One of the addresses may be highlighted as shown at email address selection . Label reads To in an English version of the software. All labels may of course contain translated equivalents of the exemplary English labels illustrated as needed.

The address selection list is a list of the first entries in the local address book stored in handheld device headed with a Use Once entry. If the address book is empty or the intended recipient s address is not in the address book only the Use Once option and a message line that reads No Addresses is displayed indicating that the address book is empty. The message line itself may be selectable and if selected it may prompt for a new address using a new email address entry window not shown .

If the address book is not empty the user may select the entry with the name of a recipient in the address list as shown in . Upon selecting a recipient a popup menu not shown with a pre selected entry that reads email selected name may be presented where selected name is actually the name of the selected email recipient e.g. Scotte Zinn . Once the pre selected highlighted popup menu entry is selected the screenshot as depicted in may be launched. Screenshot includes an un editable field containing the selected recipient. A popup menu not shown in may be invoked by way of trackwheel with entries labeled as Add To Add Cc Add Bcc and Delete Field . Screenshot also typically includes label which reads Subject and fields and which are freeform fields for entering the subject and contents of the email being composed respectively.

If the Use Once entry is selected using trackwheel or by tapping the enter key on keyboard while the Use Once entry is highlighted screenshot shown in is displayed. A message label states One Time Email while label reads Email and field is freeform to allow typing of the recipient. Label is intended to indicate to the user that the current email is for use on a one time basis and is not retrieved from the address book. After entering the email address in field and pressing the enter key or equivalently pressing the trackwheel the screenshot depicted in appears.

It can be easily appreciated that the sequence of actions to arrive at screenshot is not very intuitive or as straightforward as possible. In that regard new users who have not synchronized their local address book in their handheld device will have to undertake the steps represented by the sequence of user interfaces shown in in order to send an e mail. Furthermore whether or not the recipient is found in the address book the steps required to send an email using known email clients is inconsistent with the way email is composed using popular desktop email client applications such as Outlook from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash. USA. For example it may not be quite clear what Use Once in means to one who is not already well versed in the use of the handheld device executing a conventional email client. Also the number of menu accesses to navigate through to screenshot can be considerable. It is therefore likely that the user interfaces depicted in may be sources of confusion and frustration to users especially novice users.

As mentioned earlier the sequence of user interaction described thus far results from handheld device operating with known software. Several variations exist consequent upon different known software loads. However these variations nonetheless exhibit at least some of the disadvantageous characteristics identified.

One approach to solve the user interface problems identified is to have the handheld device mimic to the extent possible standard user interfaces used in popular desktop applications. Conveniently handheld device may be adapted to operate in exemplary inventive manners by the way of new software loaded onto device .

In this regard returning to the microprocessor in handheld device may be used to run software applications comprising processor executable instructions. Microprocessor interacting with RAM and other device subsystems may execute operating system software and other application software which may be stored in a persistent store such as flash memory . In addition applications may be loaded onto handheld device from an external source accessible through auxiliary I O serial port short range communications subsystem or other device subsystems for execution by microprocessor . As depicted in software applications such as an email client electronic calendar or appointment organizers may execute inside a virtual machine running atop an operation system . An exemplary virtual machine may be the K virtual machine KVM from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. USA. The applications may have the ability to send and or receive data via the network .

Software applications such as applications according to embodiments of this disclosure may easily be implemented using a standard programming language such as the Java programming language targeting a virtual machine executing in handheld device . To make use of a virtual machine an application development platform such as the Java 2 Micro Edition J2ME along with a development environment which may be a variant of the Java Development Environment JDE from Sun Microsystems Inc. may be used to develop applications. Application developer guides for a specific development platform may be consulted to develop an application with user interfaces as disclosed herein. JDE for a particular handheld device for example provides a set of application programming interfaces API which provides access to device features including user interface networking localization and other capabilities. Thus using the above resources and related hardware software and documentation the descriptions of embodiments of the user interface layouts provided hereinafter and associated features can be implemented in a straightforward manner by those with ordinary skill in the art. Alternately many other programming approaches languages and platforms may be used. For instance the application may target the operating system of device directly or another programming language such as C or C may be used. The approach outlined above is thus only exemplary and in no way limiting.

A handheld device operated in exemplary inventive manners may start out by launching a start up screen similar to that in and displaying icons which may be labeled as Messages Address book Calendar Browser etc. Icons allow the user to launch new user interface screen on display when selected by trackwheel or keyboard .

Exemplary screenshots of handheld device when loaded with software so as to operate in accordance with the present disclosure are depicted in . depicts a schematic diagram of an exemplary screenshot of a handheld device executing a client application launched after a selection is made to compose email. Screenshot may be launched by selecting a Compose Email option from a pop up menu available when in a messages application. Alternatively a Compose icon may be present in the startup screen that launches screenshot upon selection. Other ways of launching screenshot starting from the startup screen may also be included.

Screenshot is an exemplary email composition screen. Screenshot includes labels and which read To Cc and Subject respectively. Recipient field is a freeform field in which a recipient may be entered. Field is a freeform field in which copied recipients are entered. Field is a free form field in which the subject heading for the email is entered while field allows the message content of the email to be keyed in.

As the user types text in to field any matching names may be selected from the address book and displayed in a selection menu as shown in . Matching names are sought from the name field and from the company field of entries in the address book and optionally from other fields as well. For reasons which will be explained the menu may be headed with the entries Email and Lookup The menu may allow a user to move down to one of the listed addresses and select an entry. Selection menu is dynamically updated upon each keystroke entry of text into recipient field by displaying in the selection menu a filtered list of names so that only names containing the typed text in field are displayed. As shown in only names matching An are listed in selection menu as a result of the user typing An into recipient field . Menu may occupy as much vertical space below the field as allowable. Moreover the screen may scroll to allow at least two screens of menu .

As the user types in more letters the list of matching names may become shorter since names that do not match the typed text are successively removed from selection menu with each keystroke entry of text into field . If the user selects an entry in selection menu the selected entry will be inserted into field field is changed to become a non freeform field and the selection menu disappears. If the selected entry contains no email address a warning is displayed indicating that the entry does not contain an email address. Conversely if the selected entry contains multiple email addresses a dialog or menu not shown is displayed with a list of possible email addresses for the recipient to allow the user to select one.

In one embodiment if an escape key is pressed while the selection menu has focus the menu disappears and field receives focus again. In alternate embodiments the user can close selection menu by continuing to scroll up after the top item in selection menu has received focus. In other embodiments if a user changes a field e.g. field while menu is not visible either by keystroke or using the trackwheel then menu reappears.

After an address is selected and inserted into recipient field a new input field of the same type To Cc or Bcc appears. For example as shown in a new To label B and a second recipient field B appears after the initial To recipient field was populated with the selected recipient. When the email is sent all blank recipient fields are automatically stripped out. Conversely a second recipient may then be provided in the new To field B in a manner similar to the way of the first recipient is specified. The user may change the focus to any desired input field e.g. from the recipient field B to the copy recipient field using the trackwheel. At any time the popup selection menu of may be invoked by pressing the trackwheel to select one of the entries labeled as Add To Add Cc Add Bcc or Delete Field . As the labels suggest new input fields may be added Add To entry is used to add a new email recipient the Add Cc entry is used to add a copy email address and the Add Bcc entry is used to add a blind copy email address. To delete a field either the delete key may be pressed or the popup menu may be invoked while focus is on a given input field and the Delete Field entry selected to remove the unwanted input field.

The possibility exists that the intended e mail recipient is not in the address book but the user knows the e mail address of the recipient. To facilitate entry of an e mail address as text characters are typed in recipient field or B the contents are translated in a special SMTP simple mail transfer protocol Email Translation Field that appears at the top of the selection menu. This character translation works as follows. Letters and numbers remain unaltered. The first space character is translated into a symbol and subsequent space characters are translated into periods. For instance the sequence of letters inside the double quotes terry van belle in this translation scheme would be translated to terry van.belle inside the single quotes which results after replacing the first space by and the subsequent space by a period just as described above. As the first five letters terry are entered the SMTP email translation field at the top of selection menu would read terry while selection menu also displays address book entries matching the string terry if any. As the first space character is typed in the SMTP email translation field will now read terry in accordance with the translation scheme just described. After the second space character is entered i.e. terry van the SMTP email translation field would read terry van. and entries in menu that do not match terry van would disappear although the SMTP email translation field and the Lookup entry would still be visible . As the rest of the string characters are keyed in the translated field would finally read terry van.belle . Alternatively the translated text could appear in the recipient field rather than in a separate SMTP translation field. The user may override the translation scheme in either of the following two ways. In the first way after typing the first space character such that the SMTP email translation field reads terry the user may tap the backspace key to delete the space and then tap the space key again. The consequence in the SMTP email translation field is that the symbol is deleted upon the pressing of the backspace key and a space rather than a symbol is inserted upon the subsequent pressing of the space key. The same sequence may be used to delete subsequent periods in the SMTP email translation field. In the second way the user may press the shift key along with the space key in order to force insertion of a space rather than a translated character in the SMTP email translation field.

The email composition screen as shown in and may also allow a lookup in a global address list GAL . The GAL is a list of recipients that resides in a remote computing device such as server in . Thus not all recipient email addresses need be stored in handheld device as a GAL may be inspected by way of wired and or wireless interconnections shown in . Specifically the top of menu includes Lookup entry with a label and a field mirroring the current contents of field except that occurrences of and in the text of field are replaced with spaces . From the menu a user selects the Lookup entry to search the GAL residing in a remote server. Thus although all matching address book entries i.e. locally stored recipient names would be listed in menu as the user types text into field the user may select Lookup entry to trigger a global address lookup. The string in field is then sent over network to a server computer using the communications subsystem over network as shown in . In server recipients that match the received string are selected from the global address list and transmitted back to the device where they are received processed and presented to the user as shown in . If the string is not found in the GAL the list should not appear but instead the field reads Lookup Failed keywords where keywords represents the contents of field .

An exemplary result of a remote or global address lookup is displayed in screenshot in . The title label reads Lookup keywords n matches or its equivalent where n stands for the number of matches found in a remote address lookup. The title label thus indicates how many matches were found. If the search returns only one address then in one embodiment the returned address is automatically filled in to the appropriate recipient field without displaying screenshot . In one embodiment the lookup screen is not automatically displayed. Instead the input field reads Lookup keywords n matches . If the menu is invoked while focus is in such a field the menu contains a View Lookup entry. Selecting View Lookup then invokes screenshot . Once an entry is selected screenshot disappears and the email composition screen appears.

A detailed step by step example of using one embodiment of a user interface for composing and sending an email message is described below with reference to .

Turning to a block diagram of an empty email composition screen is depicted. Screen is similar to the screenshot depicted in but additionally shows a Send Using label and associated Send Using field . By default when a new e mail composition screen is opened as shown the Send Using field may be set to the option of Default .

While focus is on the Send Using field the user may press trackwheel on obtain pop up menu . The user may then select the Change Option entry in pop up menu . This results in the pop up of a selection menu as shown in which lists possible services to use in order to send the email message. In this way the user may select which email service to use and in consequence the contents of the From field in the e mail message which is sent. As shown the user has the option of choosing an enterprise service labeled Desktop or another internet service Rogers which is labeled with the actual address which will appear in the From field of the e mail message if this service is chosen. The default entry in menu is associated with one of the listed services i.e. one of the services indicated by labels and . The user may separately set which service is to be considered the default service so that the user will know which service he is using when the default service is selected.

For example if a user changes the option to the Desktop entry representing the enterprise email service then as shown in Desktop is thereafter displayed in the Send Using field .

Selection menu is dynamically updated upon each keystroke entry of text into recipient field by displaying in the selection menu a filtered list of names containing the typed text. Thus in all names containing a j are listed in selection menu as a result of the user typing j into the recipient field . As the user adds more text into the recipient field a smaller subset of names is shown in the menu. Accordingly in only names matching the text jaco are listed in menu .

If the user focuses on the recipient represented by entry in menu as shown in and selects this recipient since this selected recipient has more than one email address in the address book as seen in another pop up menu is displayed to facilitate selection of the email address to use. Specifically menu lists all email addresses in the address book that are associated with the selected recipient. The user highlights and selects one of the email addresses using trackwheel as shown in the address jsauer rim.net .

Upon the user selecting a particular email address as seen in the selected recipient is displayed in recipient field and the selected email address is internally stored for use when actually sending the completed email message. Notably if the user had not changed the email service indicated by the Send Using field from its initial Default setting upon selection of the recipient the Default indicator in this field is replaced with the label for the actual service which is associated with the Default indicator for example the Desktop label . Moreover upon selection of a recipient s email address a new To label and an associated recipient field are displayed to facilitate accepting an additional email recipient.

Trackwheel may be used to invoke pop up menu in order to select the addition of a blind carbon copy by selecting the Add Bcc entry of the menu . Upon such selection as seen in a Bcc label and an associated field are added to the composition screen. The specification of a Bcc recipient in field proceeds in the same manner to the above described procedure specifying the Cc recipient in field . Specifically as shown in once the user has typed kris into the Bcc recipient field the menu of matching names will be filtered to include only address book entries matching this text string.

Upon selection of a Bcc recipient as shown in the recipient Krishna Pathiyal this recipient is displayed in Bcc recipient field and a new Bcc recipient field is added along with a corresponding label . The new field may be populated as described above or ignored by the user.

If the intended recipient is not in the address book as depicted in selection menu may only include the Email and Lookup entries. As shown in this has resulted from the user populating the second Cc recipient field with the text balsil . Further this figure shows the user has focused on the Lookup entry on selection menu . If the user selects this entry to lookup or inspect a global address list that resides in a corporate mail server accessible via corporate mail service the microprocessor is prompted to query the corporate mail server at which the global address list resides. Matching names retrieved from the global address list are displayed as shown in in menu . Menu may be headed with an indication of how many matches were found. Thus in the heading text Lookup balsil 2 matches indicates that two matches were found in the global address list. The user may then select a desired recipient by focusing an indicator on this recipient and pressing the enter key from keyboard or using trackwheel to bring up a pop up menu and select the Continue option . Upon selection of a recipient the recipient name populates the second Cc recipient field and a new third Cc recipient field with an associated Cc label is then added to the composition screen as shown in .

The user may also enter the recipient address directly into the recipient field which is useful if the recipient address is neither in the address book nor in the global address list . For example if the user wants to send an email to batman rimcom the user can type batman rimcom or batman rim com into the second recipient field . In the latter case as noted earlier a character translation is used in which letters and numbers remain unaltered while the first space character is translated into the symbol and subsequent space characters are translated into periods. Further once the user has looked up a text string in the global address list in the present example the string balsil and selected one of the returned names the selected name and associated e mail address is cached locally and will appear in each future appearance of selection menu . For this reason name specific look up field appears at the head of selection menu in . This has the advantageous result that an entry not in the local address book but previously obtained from the global address list here James Balsillie can be added to an e mail message without inspecting the global address list again. Cached address entries may be retained until the entry is added to the local address book or deleted.

Once the recipient is specified in the second recipient field a third recipient field and associated label are added to the email composition screen as shown in . In general a new recipient field with an associated label are added to the email composition screen after a recipient has been selected and filled into the last available recipient field. This new field is of the same type as the most recently populated recipient field. Thus if the most recently populated field is a To field a new To field and associated label is added if the most recently populated field is a Cc field a new Cc field and associated label is added and if the most recently populated field is a Bcc field a new Bcc field and associated label is added.

It may be that a user after typing a text string into one of the recipient fields such as lazaridis inadvertently selects the option Email lazaridis from the selection menu . In consequence the name lazaridis will appear in the To field. In this case the user may scroll to this To field and click the trackwheel to obtain a context specific pop up menu . This menu will include an entry Lookup lazaridis the selection of which will cause the microprocessor to retrieve matching names from the global address list and display these.

The process of matching the typed text in a recipient field to entries in the address book is done by comparing the typed text to both the name of a recipient in an address book entry and also other attributes in the address book entry such as company names. Accordingly with reference to when j is typed into the recipient field then recipient David Shepherd Janna Systems is listed in selection menu although the letter j does not appear anywhere in the name David Shepherd The match is due to the company name Janna Systems associated with recipient David Shepherd .

In an alternate embodiment illustrated in the selection menu lists not only recipients previously looked up and selected from the global address list but also the results of look up searches of the global address list such as search .

The described approach and user interfaces may also be used with messaging services other than e mail such as a Personal Identification Number PIN based addressing service a short messaging service SMS a multimedia messaging service MMS or an instant messaging IM service. Where handheld device may operate using one or more of these services the user may select a particular service to use.

For example a handheld device may have a personal identification number PIN associated with it and a service may exist to allow addressing messages with a PIN. When two such devices communicate using a PIN based addressing service one device may send a message using a recipient s PIN instead of an email address . Using handheld device operating according to an embodiment of the present disclosure a user may arrive at a screen similar to screenshot by selecting the Messages icon invoking a popup selection menu not shown and selecting a Compose PIN entry. The handheld device may now be said to be in PIN mode . As described for email composition when a user types in text to an input field such as field matching name entries from the address book appear in a selection menu such as selection menu . After the user selects a name the selected entry is displayed in the input field. If the selected recipient in selection menu does not have a PIN address a message indicating this may be displayed to the user. It is also possible that the intended recipient is not in the address book but the user knows the PIN of the recipient. To facilitate entry of the PIN as text characters are entered the client software may perform validation of the characters entered into a PIN input field and eliminate invalid PIN characters. For example valid PIN characters in one embodiment may only include numeric characters 0 9 and letters a f and A F.

A step by step example of using one embodiment of the user interface for composing and sending a PIN message is described below with reference to .

An exemplary PIN composition window is shown in . The PIN composition window is similar to the email composition window of but does not include the Send Using field and label. The user can type text into recipient To field whereupon the microprocessor accesses the address book in local memory to find any matching names. These matching names are displayed in a selection menu as shown in . The user can move an indicator down menu to focus on one of the listed addresses and select a recipient. If the number of entries is too numerous to show on the display the user may also scroll down menu using trackwheel to see additional entries. Menu may contain all matching entries or the menu may be capped at a pre determined number of entries.

Selection menu is dynamically updated upon each keystroke entry of text into PIN recipient field by displaying in the selection menu a filtered list of names containing the typed text. Thus as a result of the user typing jac into the recipient field in only names containing the text jac are listed in selection menu . Additionally as illustrated the results of earlier global address list searches are shown.

As is the case with other input fields discussed above upon selection of a PIN recipient as shown in the recipient is displayed in PIN recipient field and a new PIN recipient field is added along with a corresponding label . The new field may be populated in the manner described above or ignored by the user. If the selected recipient did not have an associated PIN address a warning to the user is generated.

In an alternate embodiment keyboard may be a reduced keyboard in which multiple letters symbols and or digits and the like are assigned to any given key. For example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 091 885 to Fux et al. the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference multiple letters arrayed in a QWERTY arrangement are represented by a single key. Thus the upper left key represents the letters q and w the next key the letters e and r and so on. Other known reduced keyboards have included other arrangements of keys letters symbols digits and the like. Since a single actuation of such a key potentially could be intended by the user to refer to any of the represented letters the input generally is an ambiguous input and is in need of some type of disambiguation in order to be useful for text entry purposes.

To enable a user to make use of the multiple letters digits and the like on any given key various keystroke interpretation systems have been provided. For instance a multi tap system allows a user to substantially unambiguously specify a particular character on a key by pressing the same key a number of times equivalent to the position of the desired character on the key.

In another keystroke interpretation system a user presses keys to which the desired characters amongst others have been assigned generally pressing each key one time for each desired letter and disambiguation software attempts to predict the intended input.

Accordingly in one embodiment multiple characters appear on each key of the keyboard of the handheld and the user interface software includes disambiguation software that predicts the intended input of the user from a potentially ambiguous input. A step by step example of email composition using one embodiment employing a disambiguation engine is depicted in .

In to enter text to the recipient filed of an empty e mail composition screen the user presses a key representative of the letters e and r . This results in the first of these letters i.e. the letter e being displayed in the recipient field and in the appearance of selection menu populated with address book names containing either the letter e or the letter r .

In the user inputs an additional ambiguous letter into recipient field by pressing a key which signifies both the letters a and s . In this instance the recipient field displays the letter s as this is considered the more likely letter to follow the supposed initial e . Selection menu is also updated to display all address book entries that contain ra ea es or rs . In other words all address book entries that may match all possible interpretations of the input text are displayed.

In another embodiment short messaging service SMS may be used to send a text message to a recipient. Here instead of an email address or a PIN a phone number is used to specify recipients. A phone number associated with an SMS enabled device may be specified as a recipient directly or through selection of a name in the address book associated with a phone number. Again using handheld device a user may arrive at an SMS composition screen by selecting the Messages icon invoking a popup selection menu not shown and selecting a Compose SMS entry. Of course in an SMS composition screen only the To label and corresponding field is displayed since Cc and Bcc labels or associated input fields are not supported by SMS. If the intended recipient is not in the address book or no phone number is associated with the recipient but the user knows the phone number of the recipient the user may enter the phone number into the input field. As the user keys in a phone number the client software may assist the user by performing validation as characters are entered into a phone number input field and eliminating invalid characters. For example valid phone number characters in one embodiment include only numeric characters 0 9.

In yet another embodiment multimedia messaging service MMS may be used to send a text message and multimedia attachments to a recipient. Here either a phone number or an email address is used to specify recipients. A phone number associated with an MMS enabled device may be specified as a recipient. Using handheld device a user may arrive at an MMS composition screen by selecting the Messages icon invoking a popup selection menu not shown and selecting a Compose MMS entry. As is the case for SMS in an MMS composition screen only the To label and corresponding field are displayed since Cc and Bcc labels or associated input fields are not supported by MMS. If the intended recipient is not in the address book the user may enter the phone number of the recipient directly into the input field. The client software may assist the user by performing validation as characters are entered into a phone number input field and eliminating invalid characters. Similar to the case for SMS valid phone number characters in one embodiment are restricted to numeric characters 0 9.

In yet another embodiment instant messaging IM may be used to send and receive text messages to a recipient in real time. Here a buddy name is used to specify recipients and a buddy name from a contact list associated with an instant messaging service is used to select a recipient. Using an instant messaging client on handheld device a user arrives at an instant messaging screen. Instant messaging requires the user to log into an IM server. Once logged in the user may initiate two way communication with another user a buddy who is also logged in to the IM server. Similar to what was described for email composition when a user types in text to the input field matching buddy name entries from the list of contacts that are online buddy names may appear in a selection menu similar to selection menu allowing the user to select one. After the user selects a name the selected entry is displayed in a field such as field and the user may then send and receive messages in real time. Rather than selecting a name from a contact list buddy list the user has the option of keying in a known buddy name.

In alternate implementations of instant messaging a buddy name may be associated with address book entries. Using an instant messaging client on handheld device a user may arrive at an instant messaging screen. As described for email composition when a user types in text to the input field matching recipient names from the address book are displayed in selection menu allowing the user to select one. After the user selects a name the selected entry may be displayed in a field such as field and the user may send and receive messages in real time. However if the selected entry does not have an associated buddy name the user is warned. Once again the user may have the option of keying in a known buddy name into a recipient input field.

As may be appreciated by an ordinary user of popular desktop applications the layout of screenshot shown in is substantially the same as user interface layouts commonly used in popular desktop email clients. In particular field corresponding to label which reads To and field corresponding to label which reads Cc are now very intuitive to use even for novice users working with a handheld device with no address book entries. Users may now simply type the address of the recipient in to the field or field without first going through menu driven input sequences such as the dropdown list similar to in . As a further advantage the often confusing Use Once selection shown in is conveniently avoided altogether. The improved user interface thus allows for a more enjoyable user experience and a reduced learning curve for new users which in turn may help drive demand for wireless communication devices and related services.

Of course the above described embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and in no way limiting. The described embodiments are susceptible to many modifications of form arrangement of parts details and order of operation. The disclosed embodiments are rather intended to encompass all such modification within the scope as defined by the claims.
