In some embodiments a wired connection between the monitoring client and a patient care device also affords an opportunity for electrical power to be supplied to the patient care device from the monitoring client . In this exemplary embodiment the monitoring client may include the electronic circuitry necessary to convert the voltage to power the patient care device from either a battery attached to the monitoring client or from an Alternative Current AC line voltage fed into the monitoring client from a power outlet not shown in a patient s room. Additionally or alternatively the dock supplies power to the infusion pumps and and to the microinfusion pump e.g. from a signal generated from an AC line voltage.

In an embodiment the monitoring client is capable of receiving information about each patient care device with which it is linked either directly from the device itself or via a docking station such as for example the dock onto which the patient care device may be mounted. The dock may be configured to receive one or more patient care devices via a standardized connection mount or in some cases via a connection mount individualized for the particular device. For example infusion pumps and may be mounted to the dock via a similar connection mount whereas the microinfusion pump for example may be mounted to the dock via a connection mount configured for the particular dimensions of the microinfusion pump s housing.

The dock may be configured to electronically identify the particular patient care device being mounted on the docking station and to transmit this identifying information to the monitoring client either wirelessly or via a wired connection. Additionally or alternatively wireless patient care devices may transmit the identifying information wirelessly to the monitoring client e.g. during a discovery protocol. Additionally the particular patient care device may be preprogrammed with treatment information e.g. patient treatment parameters such as an infusion rate for a predetermined infusion liquid that is transmitted to the monitoring client . For example the syringe pump may include identity information and treatment information such as what medication has been prescribed to the patient what liquid is within the syringe pump s reservoir how much and how long the liquid is prescribed to be delivered to the patient who are the authorized caregivers etc. In some embodiments of the present disclosure the monitoring client communicates with EMR records to verify that the preprogrammed treatment information is safe for an identified patient and or the preprogrammed treatment information matches the prescribed treatment stored in the EMR records.

In some embodiments the drip detection device may communicate with the monitoring client either wirelessly or in a wired connection. If an aberrant liquid flow condition is detected e.g. because the tubing to the patient has become occluded a signal may be transmitted to monitoring client which 1 may display the flow rate of liquid from the liquid container in a user interface either locally on the monitoring client or more remotely to a user interface at a nurse s station or a handheld communications device 2 may trigger an auditory or visual alarm and or 3 may cause the monitoring client to alter the rate of infusion of a pump connected to a bag by either terminating the infusion or otherwise changing the pumping rate The aberrant liquid flow condition may also cause an audible alarm and or vibration alarm on the infusion pump or the drip detection device or cause the infusion pump to modify or stop the pumping e.g. when the aberrant liquid flow condition exceed predefined ranges of operation.

The alarms may occur simultaneously on several devices or may follow a predetermined schedule. For example when an occlusion occurs in a line connected to the infusion pump 1 the drip detection device alarms using its internal speaker and an internal vibration motor 2 thereafter the infusion pump alarms using its internal speaker and an internal vibration motor 3 next the monitoring client alarms using its internal speaker and an internal vibration motor and 4 finally a remote communicator e.g. a smart phone blackberry based phone Android based phone iphone etc. alarms using its internal speaker and an internal vibration motor. In some embodiments the syringe pump may be connected to the drip detection device and detect aberrant liquid flow conditions as described above.

In some embodiments the syringe pump may be programmable to allow for continued operation at a predetermined pumping rate should communications fail between the monitoring client and the syringe pump either because of a malfunction in the monitoring client in the communications channel between the monitoring client and the syringe pump or in the syringe pump itself. In some embodiments this independent function option is enabled when the medication being infused is pre designated for not being suspended or held in the event of a malfunction in other parts of the system. In some embodiments the syringe pump is programmed to operate independently in a fail safe mode and may also be configured to receive information from a drip detection device directly rather than through a monitoring client e.g. in embodiment where the drip detection device is used in conjunction with the syringe pump with this option the syringe pump may be programmed in some embodiments to stop an infusion if the drip detection device detects an aberrant flow condition such as e.g. a free flow condition or an air bubble present in the infusion line . In some embodiments one or more of the pumps and may have internal liquid flow meters and or can operate independently as a stand alone device. Additionally or alternatively an internal liquid flow meter of the syringe pump may be independently determined by a flow meter of the drip detection device by the monitoring client in embodiments where the devices and are used together.

The monitoring client may also remotely send a prescription to a pharmacy. The prescription may be a prescription for infusing a fluid using the syringe pump . The pharmacy may include one or more computers connected to a network e.g. the internet to receive the prescription and queue the prescription within the one or more computers. The pharmacy may use the prescription to compound the drug e.g. using an automated compounding device coupled to the one or more computers or manually by a pharmacists viewing the queue of the one or more computers pre fill a fluid reservoir or cartridge of a syringe pump and or program the syringe pump e.g. a treatment regime is programmed into the syringe pump at the pharmacy in accordance with the prescription. The reservoir or cartridge may be automatically filled by the automated compounding device and or the syringe pump may be automatically programmed by the automated compounding device. The automated compounding device may generate a barcode RFID tag and or data. The information within the barcode RFID tag and or data may include the treatment regime prescription and or patient information. The automated compounding device may attach the barcode to the syringe pump or to the reservoir cartridge or disposable portion of the syringe pump attach the RFID tag to the syringe pump or the reservoir cartridge or disposable portion of the syringe pump and or program the RFID tag or memory within the syringe pump or the reservoir cartridge or disposable portion of the syringe pump with the information or data. The data or information may be sent to a database that associates the prescription with the syringe pump or the reservoir cartridge or disposable portion of the syringe pump e.g. using a serial number or other identifying information within the barcode RFID tag or memory.

The syringe pump may have a scanner e.g. an RFID interrogator that interrogates a reservoir disposable portion or cartridge of the syringe pump to determine that it is the correct fluid within the fluid reservoir or it is the correct fluid reservoir disposable portion or cartridge the treatment programmed into the syringe pump corresponds to the fluid within the fluid reservoir disposable portion or cartridge and or the syringe pump and reservoir disposable portion or cartridge of the syringe pump are correct for the particular patient e.g. as determined from a patient s barcode RFID or other patient identification . For example a serial number of a reservoir disposable portion as scanned by the syringe pump is compared to a serial number in electronic medical records to determine if it correctly corresponds to a patient s serial number within the electronic medical records the syringe pump may scan a RFID tag or barcode of a patient to obtain a serial number of a patient which is also compared to the patient s serial number within the electronic medical records e.g. the serial number of a reservoir disposable portion or cartridge of the syringe pump or a serial number stored within memory of the syringe pump should be associated with the patient s serial number as scanned within the electronic medical records . The syringe pump may issue an error or alarm if the serial numbers do not match in some specific embodiments. Additionally or alternatively the monitoring client may scan the reservoir disposable portion cartridge or syringe pump to determine that it is the correct fluid within the fluid reservoir it is the correct fluid reservoir the treatment programmed into the syringe pump corresponds to the fluid within the fluid reservoir or cartridge and or the fluid reservoir and syringe pump are correct for the particular patient e.g. as determined from a patient s barcode RFID or other patient identification . Additionally or alternatively the monitoring client or syringe pump may interrogate an electronic medical records database and or the pharmacy to verify the prescription or download the prescription e.g. using a barcode serial number on the syringe pump or a reservoir cartridge or disposable portion of the syringe pump .

The liquid being delivered to a patient may be monitored by the monitoring client to determine if all the medications being delivered are safe for the patient. For example the monitoring client may log the medication delivered from the syringe pump as communicated by the syringe pump to the monitoring client and the monitoring client may also log the medication being delivered by the infusion pumps and and or the microinfusion pump . The monitoring client may make a determination from the logged data to determine if the aggregate amounts and types of medication being delivered are safe. For example the monitoring client may determine if the IV bag is contraindicated with the medication in the syringe pump . Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments the monitoring client may monitor the delivery of the liquid in the IV bag and one or more boluses delivered by the syringe pump to determine if the total dose exceeds a predetermined threshold e.g. the medication in the IV bag and syringe pump may be the same type or class of drug and the monitoring client may determine if the drugs are safe when combined as delivered to the patient. The syringe pump may also communicate with the infusion pumps and and or the microinfusion pump to make the same determination In this exemplary embodiment the syringe pump may communicate with the devices directly via wirelessly or wired communications or through the monitoring client via wirelessly or wired communications . In some embodiments of the present disclosures one or more communication modules e.g. each having the capabilities to communicate via one or more protocols may be connected to the syringe pump and or may be connected together and then connected to the syringe pump to enable the syringe pump to communicate via the communication modules.

The syringe pump includes a touch screen interface which may be detachable a start button and a stop button . The user interface may be used to program treatment regimes such as flow rates bolus amounts or other treatment parameters. After a treatment regime is programmed into the syringe pump the syringe pump may query a database e.g. Electronic Medical Records EMR Drug Error Reduction System DERS or other database to determine if the treatment regime is safe for the particular patient or for any patient. For example the syringe pump may query the EMR database e.g. via a wireless link wired link WiFi cell phone network or other communications technology to determine if the treatment regime from the syringe pump is safe based upon patient information stored e.g. age weight allergies condition etc. in the EMR records. Additionally or alternatively the syringe pump may query the DERS database e.g. via a wireless link wired link WiFi cell phone network or other communications technology to determine if the treatment regime from the syringe pump is safe based upon predetermined safety criteria in the DERS records

In some embodiments if the treatment regime is determined to be safe a prompt may request user confirmation of the treatment regime. After user confirmation the user e.g. caregiver nurse or other authorized person may press the start button . In some embodiments the stop button may be pressed at any time to stop treatment.

In some embodiments if the EMR and or DERS determines that the treatment regime exceeds a first set of criteria treatment may continue if the user confirms the treatment e.g. with an additional warning user passcode and or additional authentication or authorization etc. in this embodiment the EMR or DERS may prevent the treatment from being delivered if the EMR and or DERS determines that the treatment regime exceeds a second set of criteria e.g. the treatment is not safe under any circumstances for any patient for example.

Each of the pumps includes a touch screen which may be used to control the pumps . One of the pumps e.g. touch screen may also be used to coordinate operation of all of the pumps and or to control the other ones of the pumps .

The pumps and are daisy chained together such that they are in electrical communication with each other. Additionally or alternatively the pumps and or may share power with each other or among each other For example one of the pumps and or may include an AC DC converter that converts AC electrical power to DC power suitable to power the other pumps.

Within the system the pumps and are stacked together using respective Z frames . Each of the Z frames includes a lower portion and an upper portion . A lower portion of one Z frame e.g. the lower portion of the pump can engage an upper portion of another Z frame e.g. the upper portion of the Z frame of the pump .

A clamp may be coupled to one of the pumps e.g. the pump as shown in . That is the clamp may be coupled to any one of the pumps . The clamp is attachable to the back of any one of the pump . As is easily seen in each of the pumps includes an upper attachment member and a lower attachment member . A clamp adapter facilitates the attachment of the clamp to the pump via a respective pump s e.g. or upper attachment member and lower attachment member . In some embodiments the clamp adapter may be integral with the clamp .

As is easily seen in the clamp adapter also includes a latch . The latch is pivotally mounted to the clamp adapter via pivots . The latch may be spring biased via springs that are coupled to the hooks . Stop members prevent the latch from pivoting beyond a predetermined amount. After the hole is inserted into the lower attachment member see the clamp adapter may be rotated to bring the latch towards the upper attachment member such that the latch is compressed down by the upper attachment member until the protrusion snaps into a complementary space of the upper attachment member . The hooks help secure the clamp adapter to the pump .

Each Z frame of the pumps includes a recessed portion see and a protrusion see . A protrusion of the Z frame of one pump e.g. pumps or may engage a recessed portion of another pump to enable the pump to be stacked on top of each other. Each of the pumps includes a latch engagement member that allows another one of the pumps to be attached thereto via a latch see . The latch may include a small spring loaded flange that can snap into the space formed under the latch engagement member . The latch may be pivotally coupled to the lower portion of the Z frame .

As is seen in the latch of the pump may be pulled to withdraw a portion of the latch out of the space under the latch engagement member of the pump . Thereafter the pump may be rotated to pull out the protrusion of the pump out of the recessed portion of the Z frame of the pump such that the pump may be removed from the stack of pumps see .

Each of the pumps includes a top connector see and a bottom connector see . The connectors and allow the stacked pumps and to communication between each other and or to provide power to each other. For example if the battery of the middle pump see fails then the top pump and or the bottom pump may provide power to the middle pump as a reserve while audibly alarming.

The syringe may be loaded into a syringe holder of the syringe pump . The flange endpiece of the syringe may be placed in the left flange receiver or in the right flange receiver . When the flange endpiece is inserted into the left flange receiver the syringe faces towards the left outlet which may hold a tube that is fluidly coupled to the syringe . An engagement member may be coupled to an end fitting of the syringe when or after the syringe is loaded into the syringe holder . A threaded shaft that is coupled to a motor may be rotated to move the engagement member in any direction to discharge fluid from the syringe .

The syringe may also be loaded to the right not shown in . The syringe holder may be moved and or adjusted such that it is moved to the right so the syringe may be loaded.

When a switch is in an open position a voltmeter may be used to measure the open circuit voltage of the battery . Thereafter the switch may be closed and the closed circuit voltage from the battery may be measured. The internal resistance of the battery may be estimated by using the known impedance Z of the speaker . A processor may be used to estimate the internal resistance of the battery e.g. a processor of a syringe pump . The processor may correlate the internal resistance of the battery to the battery s health. In some embodiments of the present disclosure if the closed circuit voltage of the battery is not within a predetermined range the range may be a function of the open circuit voltage of the battery the speaker may be determined to have failed.

In some additional embodiments of the present disclosure the switch may be modulated such that the speaker is tested simultaneously with the battery . A microphone may be used to determine if the speaker is audibly broadcasting a signal within predetermined operating parameters e.g. volume frequency spectral compositions etc. and or the internal impedance of the battery may be estimated to determine if it is within predetermined operating parameters e.g. the complex impedance for example . The microphone may be coupled to the processor. Additionally or alternatively a test signal may be applied to the speaker e.g. by modulating the switch and the speaker s current waveform may be monitored by an current sensor to determine the total harmonic distortion of the speaker and or the magnitude of the current a processor may be monitored these values using the current sensor to determine if a fault condition exists within the speaker e.g. the total harmonic distortion or the magnitude of the current are not within predetermined ranges .

Various sine waves periodic waveforms and or signals maybe applied to the speaker to measure its impedance and or to measure the impedance of the battery . For example a processor of a syringe pump disclosed herein may modulate the switch and measure the voltage across the battery to determine if the battery and the speaker has an impedance within predetermined ranges if the estimated impedance of the battery is outside a first range the processor will determine that the battery is in a fault condition and or if the estimated impedance of the speaker is outside a second range the processor will determine that the speaker is in a fault condition. Additionally or alternatively if the processor cannot determine if the battery or the speaker has a fault condition but has determined that at least one exists in a fault condition the processor may issue an alert or alarm that the circuit is in a fault condition. The processor may alarm or alert a user or a remote server of the fault condition. In some embodiments of the present disclosure the syringe pump will not operate until the fault is addressed mitigated and or corrected.

In an example embodiment as shown in a syringe pump is depicted. The syringe pump may be used to deliver an agent such as but not limited to an analgesic medicament nutrient chemotherapeutic agent etc. to a patient. The syringe pump may be used to precisely delivery a quantity of an agent to a patient or deliver a precise quantity of an agent over a period of time. The syringe pump may be used in any suitable application such as though not limited to intravenous deliver intrathecal delivery intra arterial delivery enteral delivery or feeding etc.

The syringe pump comprises a housing and a syringe pump assembly . In the example embodiment in the housing is substantially a rectangular box. In alternative embodiments the housing may take any of a variety of other suitable shapes. The housing may be made of any of a number of materials or combination of materials including but not limited to metal or plastic. The housing may be extruded injection molded die cast etc. In some embodiments the housing may be comprised of a number of separate parts which may be coupled together by any suitable means. In some embodiments the housing may be taken apart or comprise a removable panel to allow the syringe pump to be easily serviced.

As shown in a syringe may be seated on the syringe pump assembly . The syringe may be a glass plastic or any other type of syringe . The syringe may be a syringe of any capacity. In some embodiments including the embodiment in the syringe may be seated on a syringe seat comprising part of the syringe pump assembly . The syringe seat may comprise a contour which allows the syringe to be cradled by the syringe seat . The syringe seat may be made of the same material as the rest of the housing a different material or may be made of several materials. The syringe seat may be coupled to the housing by a mount which may also serve as a spill splash drip fluid or debris guard.

In some embodiments the syringe seat may comprise part of the housing . In the embodiment shown in the syringe seat is part of a syringe pump assembly housing of the syringe pump assembly . In some embodiments the syringe pump assembly housing may be at least partially formed as an extrusion. In such embodiments the contours of the syringe seat may be formed during extrusion.

The syringe pump assembly may be inserted into the housing or may be coupled thereto. In the example embodiment in the syringe pump assembly is mostly disposed inside the housing . The syringe seat syringe barrel holder barrel flange clip plunger head assembly and plunger tube each a part of the syringe pump assembly are not disposed inside the housing in the exemplary embodiment shown in . In embodiments where the syringe seat is not part of the housing the mount may comprise a gasket which functions as a seal to keep unwanted foreign material from entering the housing and getting into portions of the syringe pump assembly which are disposed inside the housing . In some embodiments the mount may overhang the syringe seat and may function as a drip edge splash guard etc. which will shed liquid off and away from the syringe pump

In some embodiments the syringe pump may be converted into a different device such as though not limited to a peristaltic large volume pump. This may be accomplished by removing the syringe pump assembly from the housing and replacing the syringe pump assembly with another desired assembly. Replacement assemblies may include for example other infusion pumps assemblies such as a peristaltic infusion pump assembly.

In some embodiments a clamp may be coupled to the housing . The clamp may be any type of clamp for example a standard pole clamp or a quick release pole clamp shown . The clamp may be used to keep the syringe pump at a desired location on an object such as an I.V. pole. The clamp may be removably coupled to the housing through a clamp mount . In some embodiments the clamp mount may comprise any of a variety of fasteners such as screws bolts adhesive hook and loop tape snap fit friction fit magnets etc. In some embodiments the clamp or a part of the clamp may be formed as an integral part of the housing during manufacture.

As shown in the housing may also include a display . The display may function as a graphic user interface and allow a user to program and monitor pump operation. The display may be an electronic visual display such as a liquid crystal display touch screen L.E.D. display plasma display etc. In some embodiments the display may be complimented by any number of data input means . In the example embodiment the data input means are several user depressible buttons. The buttons may have fixed functions such as power stop silence emergency stop start therapy or lock . The lock function may lock all the user inputs to avoid inadvertent commands from being issued to the syringe pump due to a touch screen display being touched buttons being depressed or touched or any other inadvertent gesture. The data input means of other embodiments may differ. In embodiments where the display is a touch screen display the data input means may include a number of physically depressible buttons. The physically depressible button data input means may be a back up for the touch screen display and may be used in the event that the touch screen display is compromised or becomes otherwise non functional.

In a non limiting example embodiment the data input means may be built into the function of a touch screen display . The touch screen display may detect the position of a user s finger or fingers on the screen. The touch screen may be a capacitive touch screen or any other type of touch screen. The software may display virtual buttons slides and other controls. The software may also detect the user s touch or the touch of a stylus to control the machine and interact with remote computers that may communicate with the syringe pump . The software may also recognize multi touch gestures which may control the display functioning of the syringe pump interaction of the syringe pump with one or more remote computers etc. In some embodiments the syringe pump may include sensors that detect user gestures when the user is not in contact with the display. These motion detection sensors may comprise a device that transmits invisible near infrared light measuring its time of flight after it reflects off objects. Such a measurement may allow the syringe pump to detect the location of objects and the distance from the syringe pump to said objects. The syringe pump may thus be able to monitor and take commands via a user s limbs hands and fingers or movements of a user s limbs hands and fingers. One example of a motion detector is the PrimeSense 3D sensor made by the company PrimeSense of Israel. In some embodiments the display and data input means may be mounted onto the housing during manufacture of the syringe pump . The display may be removed and replaced during servicing if necessary.

The syringe pump may include a syringe barrel holder . The syringe barrel holder may securely hold the syringe barrel against the syringe seat . The syringe barrel holder may easily be adjusted by a user to accommodate syringes of various sizes. In some embodiments the syringe barrel holder may be biased so as to automatically adjust to the diameter of any size syringe after the syringe barrel holder is pulled out by a user. The syringe barrel holder will be further elaborated upon later in the specification.

The syringe pump may also include a barrel flange clip . The barrel flange clip in the example embodiment depicted in is disposed on an end of the syringe pump assembly housing and is capable of holding the syringe barrel flange in place against the end of the syringe pump assembly housing . The barrel flange clip is also capable of retaining any of a variety of syringe barrel flange types and sizes which may be available to a user. The barrel flange clip will be further elaborated upon later in the specification. For a more detailed description of the barrel flange clip see and .

The syringe pump may additionally include a plunger head assembly . The plunger head assembly may be attached to the syringe pump assembly by a plunger tube . In the example embodiment depicted in the plunger head assembly and plunger tube extend out of the housing toward the right of the page.

The syringe pump may also comprise a downstream pressure sensor as shown in . The downstream pressure sensor may comprise part of the syringe pump assembly or the housing . The downstream pressure sensor may take pressure measurements from a fluid line i.e. tubing extending from the syringe to a patient. In some embodiments the fluid line may include a span of tubing which is different from the rest of the tubing. For example a span of the fluid line may be made of a deformable PVC material. Such embodiments may make fluid line pressures easier to determine.

The downstream pressure sensor may comprise a cradle with a pressure sensor such as a force sensor. In such embodiments the fluid line may be held against the cradle and pressure sensor of the downstream pressure sensor by a non deformable or deflectable structure. The downstream pressure sensor may cause the syringe pump to alarm if the detected pressure falls outside of an acceptable range. The measurement of the downstream pressure sensor may be referenced against a look up table to determine the pressure in the fluid line. If an abnormal pressure reading e.g. a high pressure generated during an occlusion event beyond a predetermined threshold is taken a control system of the syringe pump may stop delivering fluid. In some embodiments the syringe pump may be caused to back up and relieve some of the pressure in response to the detection of pressures suggestive of an occlusion.

In the syringe pump assembly is again shown by itself. The syringe which had not been seated on the syringe seat in is seated in place on the syringe seat in . The syringe barrel flange is clipped in place by the barrel flange clip . The syringe barrel holder has been pulled out so the syringe may be placed into the syringe pump assembly but has not yet been allowed to automatically adjust to the diameter of the syringe barrel . In the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder has been rotated 90 clockwise from its orientation in to lock it in position. Alternate embodiments may require counter clockwise rotation a different degree of rotation or may not require rotation to lock the syringe barrel holder in position. The plunger tube and attached plunger head assembly are fully extended away from the rest of the syringe pump assembly . Since the dial has not been rotated from the orientation shown in the upper plunger clamp jaw and the lower plunger clamp jaw are still in the open position.

In the syringe pump assembly is again shown by itself. The syringe is seated against the syringe seat . The syringe barrel holder has been rotated out of the locked position and has been allowed to automatically adjust to the diameter of the syringe barrel . The syringe barrel holder is holding the syringe in place on the syringe pump assembly . The syringe is additionally held in place on the syringe pump assembly by the barrel flange clip which retains the syringe barrel flange . The plunger tube and attached plunger head assembly are fully extended away from the rest of the syringe pump assembly . Since the dial has not been rotated from the orientation shown in the upper plunger clamp jaw and the lower plunger clamp jaw are still in the open position.

In the syringe pump assembly is again shown by itself. The syringe is seated against the syringe seat . The syringe barrel holder is pressing against the syringe barrel and holding the syringe in place on the syringe pump assembly . The barrel flange clip is holding the syringe barrel flange and helping to the hold the syringe in place on the syringe pump assembly . The amount that the plunger tube extends away from the rest of the syringe pump assembly has been adjusted such that the plunger head assembly is in contact with the plunger flange on the syringe plunger . Since the dial has not been rotated from the orientation shown in the upper plunger clamp jaw and the lower plunger clamp jaw are still in the open position. The plunger flange is in contact with the plunger pressure sensor .

In the syringe pump assembly is again shown by itself. The syringe is seated against the syringe seat . The syringe barrel holder is pressing against the syringe barrel and holding the syringe in place on the syringe pump assembly . The barrel flange clip is clipping the syringe barrel flange and helping to the hold the syringe in place on the syringe pump assembly . The amount that the plunger tube extends away from the rest of the syringe pump assembly has been adjusted such that the plunger head assembly is in contact with the plunger flange on the syringe plunger . The dial has been rotated from the orientation depicted in . Consequentially the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw have moved to a closed position in which the plunger flange of the syringe plunger is retained by the plunger head assembly . Since the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw close about the horizontal centerline of the plunger head assembly the plunger flange has been centered on the plunger head assembly .

In the preferred embodiment the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw each comprise a fin as illustrated in . The fins bow out away from the plunger head assembly and toward the left of the page relative to . The fins are disposed about the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw such that the fins are the only part of the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw to contact a plunger flange when a syringe is placed on the syringe pump assembly . As the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw are closed down on a plunger flange the thickness and diameter of the plunger flange determine when the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw stop moving. At least some part of the fins will overhang the plunger flange and ensure the plunger flange is retained. Since the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw do not deflect this forces the plunger flange against the rest of the plunger head assembly . That is the angle of contact of the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw on the plunger flange results in a force with a component that pushes the plunger flange against the plunger head assembly . This resultant force additionally has a component which centers the plunger flange on the plunger head assembly . This is especially desirable because such an arrangement does not allow for any play of the plunger flange between upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw and the rest of the plunger head assembly . Additionally such an arrangement is desirable because it not only securely holds the plunger flange in place against the plunger head assembly but also doubles as an anti siphon mechanism. Such an arrangement furthermore ensures that the plunger flange consistently contacts the plunger pressure sensor . Any force component generated by the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw which may affect readings of the plunger pressure sensor may be predictable and subtracted out or otherwise compensated for.

In other embodiments the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw may not comprise fins . Instead the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw overhang a portion of the plunger flange when in the clamped position. The upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw may stop moving when they abut the cruciform which comprises the plunger stem . In other embodiments the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw may clamp a plunger stem that need not be a cruciform. In another embodiment the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw may include a wedge ramp or tapered rib feature on the surfaces of the jaws that faces the pump head assembly . The wedge ramp or tapered rib serve to push the plunger flange toward the pump head assembly until the plunger flange is securely held against the pump head assembly .

To dispense the contents of the syringe the syringe pump may actuate the plunger head assembly to thereby push the plunger into the syringe barrel . Since the contents of the syringe may not flow through or past the plunger pusher the contents of the syringe are forced out of the syringe outlet as the plunger is advanced into the syringe barrel . Any pressure generated as the plunger advances into the syringe barrel is transmitted to the plunger pressure sensor . The plunger pressure sensor may in some embodiments comprise a force sensor such as a strain beam. When an occlusion occurs fluid within the syringe barrel and or the fluid lines prevents movement of the plunger . When the plunger head assembly continues to advance high forces are produced between the plunger and the plunger head assembly . The pressure transmitted to the plunger pressure sensor may have a programmed acceptable range so that possible occlusions may be identified. If the pressure applied to the plunger pressure sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold the syringe pump may alarm or issue an alert.

The view shown in is similar to the view shown in . In the dial on the plunger head assembly has been rotated approximately 135 clockwise. This rotation has in turn caused the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw to separate and move to the fully open position. In alternate embodiments the dial may require more or less rotation than the approximately 135 shown in the example embodiment to transition the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw from a fully open position to a fully closed position. The plunger head assembly may be capable of holding itself in this position described later in the specification .

An exploded view of the top half of the plunger head assembly is shown in . As shown the upper plunger clamp jaw comprises two racks . In other embodiments there may only be one rack . In some embodiments there may be more than two racks . When the plunger head assembly is fully assembled the racks may interdigitate with a corresponding number of upper jaw pinion gears . The upper jaw pinion gears spin about the axis of an upper jaw drive shaft . The upper jaw drive shaft may also comprise an upper jaw drive gear which will be elaborated upon later.

The plunger head assembly may comprise a number of bearing surfaces for the upper jaw drive shaft . In the example embodiment in the plunger head assembly comprises two upper bearing surfaces and a lower bearing surface for the upper jaw drive shaft . The upper bearing surfaces may be coupled into the plunger head assembly housing top . The upper bearing surfaces may be coupled to the plunger head assembly housing top by any of a variety of means including but not limited to screws bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit welds a tongue in groove arrangement pins or may be formed as a continuous part of the plunger head assembly housing top shown . The upper bearing surfaces provide a bearing surface for at least a span of the top half of the upper jaw drive shaft .

The lower bearing surface is coupled into the plunger head assembly housing top . The lower bearing surface may be coupled to the plunger head assembly housing top by any suitable means such as but not limited to screws shown bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit magnets welds a tongue in groove arrangement etc. In some embodiments the lower bearing surface may be formed as a continuous part of the plunger head assembly housing top . The lower bearing surface provides a bearing surface for at least a span of the bottom half of the upper jaw drive shaft .

In some embodiments there may also be an upper dial shaft bearing surface which couples into the plunger head assembly housing top . The upper dial shaft bearing surface may be coupled into the plunger head assembly housing top by any of a variety of means including but not limited to screws bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit welds a tongue in groove arrangement shown pins or may be formed as a continuous part of the plunger head assembly housing top . The upper dial shaft bearing surface will be further elaborated upon later.

The upper jaw drive shaft may also comprise a D shaped span . The D shaped span may be located on an end of the upper jaw drive shaft as shown in the example embodiment in . The D shaped span of the upper jaw drive shaft may couple into a complimentary shaped orifice in one side of a D shaped connector . The D shaped span of the upper jaw drive shaft may not extend all the way through the D shaped connector . In some embodiments the orifice may run through the entire D shaped connector . The other side of the D shaped connector may couple onto a D shaped shaft projecting out of a plunger clamp jaws position sensor . Any rotation of the upper jaw drive shaft may cause the D shaped connector to rotate as well. In turn this may cause rotation of the D shaped shaft projecting from the plunger clamp jaws position sensor . In some embodiments the D shaped span of the upper jaw drive shaft may extend directly into the plunger clamp jaws position sensor . In such embodiments the D shaped connector and D shaped shaft may not be needed. In some embodiments the D shaped span the D shaped connector and D shaped shaft need not be D shaped. In some embodiments they may be have a triangular shape square shape star shape etc.

In some embodiments the plunger clamp jaws position sensor may comprise a potentiometer. As the D shaped shaft projecting from the plunger clamp jaws position sensor rotates the wiper of the potentiometer is slid across the resistive element of the potentiometer thus varying the resistance measured by the potentiometer. The resistance value may then be interpreted to indicate the position of the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw . Alternatively the plunger clamp jaws position sensor may comprise a magnet on the end of the upper jaw drive shaft and a rotary encoder such as the AS5030ATSU by Austrianmicrosytems of Austria. Alternatively the position of the upper jaw and or lower jaw can be measured with a linear encoder or a linear potentiometer.

By obtaining a position from the plunger clamp jaws position sensor the syringe pump may be able to determine a number of things. The position may be used to indicate whether a plunger flange has been clamped by the plunger head assembly . The position may indicate whether a plunger flange has been correctly clamped by the plunger head assembly . This may be accomplished by referencing the determined position against a position or a range of positions which may be acceptable for a specific syringe . The information about the specific syringe being used may be input by a user or may be gathered by one or more other sensors comprising other parts of the syringe pump .

Since the position measured by the plunger clamp jaws position sensor depends on the diameter and thickness of a clamped plunger flange the positional information may also be used to determine information about the specific syringe being used for example its type brand volume etc. . This may be accomplished by referencing the measured position against a database of positions which would be expected for different syringes . In embodiments where there are a number of sensors gathering information about the syringe the positional information generated by the plunger clamp jaws position sensor may be checked against data from other sensors to make a more informed decision on which specific syringe is being utilized. If the position measured by the plunger clamp jaws position sensor does not correlate with data gathered by other sensors the syringe pump may alarm.

As shown in the plunger head assembly housing top may also house the plunger pressure sensor mentioned earlier. The plunger pressure sensor may comprise a plunger pressure sensor push plate . The plunger pressure sensor push plate may be a nub a disc or any other suitable shape. The plunger pressure sensor push plate may be flat or rounded. The plunger pressure sensor push plate may extend out of the plunger head assembly such that it may physically contact a plunger flange clamped against the plunger head assembly . The plunger pressure sensor push plate may directly transmit any force applied to it to a plunger pressure sensor input surface . In some embodiments the plunger pressure sensor push plate may be attached to a plunger pressure sensor lever . The plunger pressure sensor lever may be pivotally coupled to a plunger pressure sensor pivot . The plunger pressure sensor pivot may be disposed at any point along the length of the plunger pressure sensor lever . In the example embodiment in any force applied to the plunger pressure sensor push plate is transmitted through the plunger pressure sensor lever to the plunger pressure sensor input surface . In some specific embodiments the plunger pressure sensor lever and plunger pressure sensor pivot may serve to constrain the motion of the plunger pressure plate to a plane perpendicular to the plunger flange and minimize resistance to free movement of the plunger pressure plate . Although the location of the plunger pressure sensor pivot in relation to the plunger pressure sensor push plate does not multiply the force exerted against the plunger pressure sensor input surface in other embodiments may use different arrangements to create a mechanical advantage.

The force measurement which is read via the plunger pressure sensor may be interpreted to determine the hydraulic pressure of the fluid being dispensed. This may contribute to safety of operation because the sensed fluid pressure may be useful in identifying possible occlusions so that they may be corrected. The pressure may be monitored such that if the pressure exceeds a predefined value the syringe pump may alarm. The pressure measurement from the plunger pressure sensor may be checked against the pressure measurement from the downstream pressure sensor see in embodiments including both a plunger pressure sensor and a downstream pressure sensor . This may help to ensure greater accuracy. If the pressure measurements do not correlate an alarm may be generated. Additionally since the sensors are redundant if one of the plunger pressure sensor or downstream pressure sensor fails during a therapy the syringe pump may function on only one of the sensors in a fail operative mode.

As shown in a number of electrical conduits run to and from the both the plunger pressure sensor and the plunger clamp jaws position sensor . The conduits provide power to the plunger pressure sensor and plunger clamp jaws position sensor . The electrical conduits also comprise the data communication pathways to and from the plunger pressure sensor and the plunger clamp jaws position sensor .

The D shaped span of the upper jaw drive shaft and the D shaped shaft of the plunger clamp jaws position sensor are coupled together by the D shaped connector . Any rotation of the upper jaw drive shaft will cause rotation of the D shaped span D shaped connector and D shaped shaft . As mentioned above this rotation may cause the wiper to slide across the resistive element of the plunger clamp jaws position sensor in embodiments where the plunger clamp jaws position sensor comprises a potentiometer.

The plunger pressure sensor is also shown in . The plunger pressure sensor push plate may extend out of the plunger head assembly such that it may physically contact a plunger flange see clamped against the plunger head assembly . The plunger pressure sensor push plate may directly transmit any force applied to it to a plunger pressure sensor input surface . In some embodiments including the one shown in the plunger pressure sensor push plate may be attached to a plunger pressure sensor lever . The plunger pressure sensor lever may be pivotally coupled to a plunger pressure sensor pivot . The plunger pressure sensor pivot may be disposed at any point along the length of the plunger pressure sensor lever . In the example embodiment in any force applied to the plunger pressure sensor push plate is transmitted through the plunger pressure sensor lever to the plunger pressure sensor input surface . Although the location of the plunger pressure sensor pivot in relation to the plunger pressure sensor push plate does not multiply the force exerted against the plunger pressure sensor input surface in other embodiments may use different arrangements to create a mechanical advantage.

The plunger head assembly housing top also includes the top half of a dial shaft passage for a dial shaft not shown which will be explained later in the specification. In the example embodiment shown in the dial shaft passage passes through the right face of the plunger head assembly housing top .

As shown in the plunger pressure sensor may comprise a plunger pressure sensor force concentrator . In embodiments where the plunger pressure sensor push plate transmits force directly to the plunger pressure sensor input surface the plunger pressure sensor force concentrator may help to concentrate the force applied to the plunger pressure sensor push plate while exerting it against the plunger pressure sensor input surface . In embodiments where the plunger pressure sensor comprises a plunger pressure sensor lever on a plunger pressure sensor pivot the plunger pressure sensor force concentrator may be on the end and face of the plunger pressure sensor lever which presses against the plunger pressure sensor input surface . This may help to concentrate the force exerted against the plunger pressure sensor input surface which may increase accuracy. It may also help to concentrate the force at the center of the plunger pressure sensor input surface making measurements more consistent and accurate.

The bottom half of the plunger head assembly and the plunger tube are shown in . As shown the lower plunger clamp jaw comprises two lower plunger clamp jaw racks . In other embodiments there may only be one lower plunger clamp jaw rack . In some embodiments there may be more than two lower plunger clamp jaw racks . Each lower plunger clamp jaw rack interdigitates with a lower plunger clamp jaw pinion gear . The lower plunger clamp jaw pinion gears are capable of rotating about the axis of a lower clamp jaw drive shaft . A lower jaw drive gear is also disposed on the lower clamp jaw drive shaft . The lower jaw drive gear will be elaborated upon later.

Similar to the upper half of the plunger head assembly the lower half of the plunger head assembly may comprise a number of bearing surfaces for the lower jaw drive shaft . In the example embodiment in the plunger head assembly comprises one upper bearing surface and two lower bearing surfaces for the lower jaw drive shaft . The upper bearing surface is coupled into the plunger head assembly housing bottom . The upper bearing surface may be coupled to the plunger head assembly housing bottom by any of a variety of means including but not limited to screws shown bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit welds a tongue in groove arrangement pins or may be formed as a continuous part of the plunger head assembly housing bottom . The upper bearing surface provide a bearing surface for at least a span of the top half of the lower jaw drive shaft .

The lower bearing surfaces are coupled into the plunger head assembly housing bottom . The lower bearing surfaces may be coupled to the plunger head assembly housing bottom by any suitable means such as but not limited to screws bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit magnets welds a tongue in groove arrangement pin shown etc. In some embodiments the lower bearing surfaces may be formed as a continuous part of the plunger head assembly housing bottom . The lower bearing surfaces provide a bearing surface for at least a span of the bottom half of the lower jaw drive shaft .

In some embodiments there may also be a lower dial shaft bearing surface which is coupled to the plunger head assembly housing bottom . The lower dial shaft bearing surface may be coupled into the plunger head assembly housing bottom by any of a variety of means including but not limited to screws bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit welds a tongue in groove arrangement pins or may be formed as a continuous part of the plunger head assembly housing bottom as shown. The lower half of the dial shaft passage mentioned above is cut through the right face of the plunger head assembly housing bottom The lower dial shaft bearing surface and dial shaft passage will be further elaborated upon later.

As shown in the plunger tube may be coupled into the bottom half of the plunger head assembly . In the example embodiment shown in the plunger tube is coupled by two screws onto a plunger tube cradle . In other embodiments the number or type of fastener coupling method may be different. For example the plunger tube may be coupled to the plunger tube cradle by any other suitable means such as but not limited to bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit magnets welds a tongue in groove arrangement pin etc. The plunger tube cradle may comprise arcuated ribs which are arced such that they are flush with the outside surface of the plunger tube and support the plunger tube . In some embodiments a portion of the arc of the plunger tube may be eliminated on the span of the plunger tube which is coupled inside of the plunger head assembly when the syringe pump is fully assembled. In the embodiment shown in about a 180 segment or the upper half of the plunger tube has been eliminated. The end of the plunger tube opposite the end of the plunger tube coupled to the plunger tube cradle may comprise a number of plunger tube cutouts which will be explained later. There may also be a conduit opening near the plunger tube cutouts .

In the dial of the plunger head assembly is shown exploded away from a dial shaft to which it couples onto when assembled. As shown the dial shaft comprises a square shaped end . The square shaped end of the dial shaft fits into a square shaped orifice in the dial such that as the dial is rotated the dial shaft is caused to rotate as well. In other embodiments the square shaped end of the dial shaft and square shaped orifice on the dial need not necessarily be square shaped but rather D shaped hexagonal or any other suitable shape.

A dial shaft gear may be disposed about the dial shaft . As the dial shaft is rotated the dial shaft gear may be caused to rotate about the axis of the dial shaft . A dial shaft cam may be slidably coupled to the dial shaft such that the dial shaft cam is capable of sliding along the axial direction of the dial shaft and the dial shaft freely rotates inside the dial shaft cam . The dial shaft cam may comprise one or more dial shaft cam ears . The dial shaft cam ears may also be referred to as dial shaft cam guides since they perform a guiding function. In the example embodiment the dial shaft cam comprises two dial shaft cam ears . In the example embodiment the cam surface of the dial shaft cam is substantially a section of a double helix. At the end of cam surface of the dial shaft cam there may be one or more dial shaft cam detents . The end of the dial shaft cam opposite the cam surface may be substantially flat.

A dial shaft cam follower may be coupled into the dial shaft such that it rotates with the dial shaft . In the example embodiment shown in the dial shaft cam follower runs through the dial shaft such that at least a portion of the dial shaft cam follower projects from the dial shaft on each side of the dial shaft . This effectively creates two dial shaft cam followers which are offset 180 from each other. Each end of the dial shaft cam follower follows one helix of the double helix shaped cam surface of the dial shaft cam .

A bias member may also be placed on the dial shaft . In the example embodiment a dial shaft compression spring is placed on the dial shaft . The dial shaft compression spring may have a coil diameter sized to fit concentrically around the dial shaft . In the example embodiment depicted in the dial shaft compression spring is retained on each end by dial shaft washers . A dial shaft retaining ring may fit in an annular groove recessed into the dial shaft .

In the end of the dial shaft opposite the square shaped end features a peg like projection . The peg like projection may couple into a joint of a double universal joint . The peg like projection may couple into the double universal joint by any suitable means such as but not limited to screws bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit magnets welds a tongue in groove arrangement pin shown etc. The other joint of the double universal joint may also couple onto a driven shaft . The other joint of the double universal joint may be coupled onto the driven shaft by any suitable means such as but not limited to screws bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit magnets welds a tongue in groove arrangement pin shown etc. The dial shaft and the driven shaft may be oriented approximately perpendicular to each other.

In some embodiments a driven shaft bushing may be included on the driven shaft . In the example embodiment shown in the driven shaft bushing is a sleeve bushing. The inner surface of the driven shaft bushing comprises the bearing surface for the driven shaft . The outer surface of the driven shaft bushing may comprise a number of driven shaft bushing projections which extend outwardly from the outer surface of the driven shaft bushing . In the example embodiment in the driven shaft bushing projections are spaced approximately 120 apart from each other along the arc of the outer surface of the driven shaft bushing . In the example embodiment shown in the driven shaft bushing projection which projects toward the top of the page comprises a nub which extends from the top edge of the driven shaft bushing projection toward the top of the page. The driven shaft bushing is held in place on the drive shaft by driven shaft retaining rings . One of the driven shaft retaining rings may be clipped into place on the driven shaft on each side of the driven shaft bushing . The end of the driven shaft not coupled into the double universal joint may comprise a driven shaft D shaped segment .

When assembled as shown in the dial shaft compression spring biases the dial shaft cam against the dial shaft cam follower such that the ends of the dial shaft cam follower are at the bottom of the cam surface of the dial shaft cam . One dial shaft washer abuts the dial shaft retaining ring and the other dial shaft washer abuts the flat side of the dial shaft cam . Preferably the distance between the dial shaft washers is at no point greater than or equal to the resting length of the dial shaft compression spring . This ensures that there is no slop and that the dial shaft cam is always biased against the ends of the dial shaft cam follower .

As shown the double universal joint connects dial shaft to the driven shaft when assembled. The driven shaft bushing is clipped into place on the driven shaft by driven shaft retaining rings see . In the embodiment depicted in the dial shaft functions as the drive shaft for the driven shaft . Any rotation of the dial shaft generated through rotation of the dial will be transmitted via the double universal joint to the driven shaft .

As shown in the dial shaft gear on the dial shaft interdigitates with the lower jaw drive gear . As the dial is rotated the dial shaft and dial shaft gear also rotate. Rotation is transmitted through the dial shaft gear to the lower jaw drive gear . Rotation of the lower jaw drive gear rotates the lower clamp jaw drive shaft and the lower clamp jaw pinion gears on the lower clamp jaw drive shaft . Since the lower clamp jaw pinion gears interdigitate with the lower plunger clamp jaw racks any rotation of the lower clamp jaw pinion gears is translated into linear displacement of the lower plunger clamp jaw . Thus in the shown embodiment rotating the dial is the means by which a user may actuate the lower plunger clamp jaw to an open or clamped position.

In the embodiment shown in rotation of the dial also causes a linear displacement of the dial shaft cam away from the dial and in the axial direction of the dial shaft . As shown in the example embodiment the upper bearing surface for the lower clamp jaw drive shaft comprises a dial shaft cam ear slit which functions as a track for a dial shaft cam ear . One of the dial shaft cam ears projects into the dial shaft cam ear slit . This ensures that the dial shaft cam may not rotate with the dial and dial shaft because rotation of the dial shaft cam ear is blocked by the rest of the upper bearing surface for the lower clamp jaw drive shaft .

The dial shaft cam ear slit does however allow the dial shaft cam to displace linearly along the axial direction of the dial shaft . As the dial and dial shaft are rotated the dial shaft cam follower also rotates. The dial shaft cam follower s location on the dial shaft is fixed such that the dial shaft cam follower is incapable of linear displacement. As the ends of the dial shaft cam follower ride up the cam surface of the dial shaft cam the dial shaft cam is forced to displace toward the right face of the plunger head assembly housing bottom relative to . The dial shaft cam ears also slide in this direction within the dial shaft cam ear slit . This causes the dial shaft compression spring to compress between the dial shaft washer abutting the dial shaft cam and the dial shaft washer abutting the dial shaft retaining ring . The restoring force of the dial shaft compression spring serves to bias the dial and all parts actuated by the dial to their original positions prior to any dial rotation. If the dial is released the dial and all parts actuated by the dial will be caused to automatically return to their original orientations prior to any dial rotation due to the expansion of the compressed dial shaft compression spring . In the example embodiment the original position prior to any dial rotation is the position depicted in where the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw are fully closed.

In some embodiments including the embodiment shown in the dial shaft cam may comprise a dial shaft cam detent along the cam surface of the dial shaft cam . The dial shaft cam detent may allow a user to park the dial shaft cam follower at a desired point along the cam surface of the dial shaft cam . In the example embodiment the dial shaft cam detent may be reached by the dial shaft cam follower when the dial has been fully rotated. When the dial shaft cam follower is in the dial shaft cam detent the dial shaft compression spring may not automatically return the dial and all parts actuated by the dial to their orientation prior to any rotation of the dial . A user may need to rotate the dial such that the dial shaft cam follower moves out of the dial shaft cam detent before the restoring force of the compressed dial shaft compression spring may be allowed to expand the dial shaft compression spring to a less compressed state.

Referring back to the upper clamp jaw pinion gears interdigitate with the upper plunger clamp jaw racks . Any rotation of the upper clamp jaw pinion gears is translated into linear displacement of the upper plunger clamp jaw . Thus rotation of the dial is the means by which a user may actuate the upper plunger clamp jaw not shown in to an open or clamped position.

The lower bearing surface for the upper jaw drive shaft is also visible in . The lower bearing surface for the upper jaw drive shaft may comprise a second dial shaft cam ear slit in embodiments where the dial shaft cam comprises more than one dial shaft cam ear . The second dial shaft cam ear slits may functions as a track for a dial shaft cam ear . One of the dial shaft cam ears projects into the second dial shaft cam ear slit . This ensures that the dial shaft cam may not rotate with the dial and dial shaft because rotation of the dial shaft cam ear is blocked by the rest of the lower bearing surface for the upper clamp jaw drive shaft .

The second dial shaft cam ear slit does however allow the dial shaft cam to displace linearly along the axial direction of the dial shaft . As the dial and dial shaft are rotated the dial shaft cam follower also rotates. The dial shaft cam follower s location on the dial shaft is fixed such that the dial shaft cam follower is incapable of linear displacement. As the ends of the dial shaft cam follower ride up the cam surface of the dial shaft cam the dial shaft cam is forced to displace toward the right face of the plunger head assembly housing bottom relative to . A dial shaft cam ear also slides in this direction within the second dial shaft cam ear slit . This causes the dial shaft compression spring to compress between the dial shaft washer abutting dial shaft cam and the dial shaft washer abutting the dial shaft retaining ring . The dial shaft compression spring dial and all parts actuated by the dial may then behave per the above description.

In some embodiments the upper jaw drive gear best shown in and lower jaw drive gear best shown in may be substantially identical gears. Additionally the upper jaw pinion gears best shown in and lower clamp jaw pinion gears best shown in may be substantially identical gears. In such embodiments the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw see will experience an equal amount of linear displacement per degree of rotation of the dial . Since the point of interdigitation of the upper jaw drive gear on dial shaft gear is opposite the point of interdigitation of the lower jaw drive gear on the dial shaft gear the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw will linearly displace in opposite directions.

The plunger pressure sensor in the embodiment depicted in comprises a plunger pressure sensor push plate which extends out of the plunger head assembly such that it may physically contact a plunger flange as shown in clamped against the plunger head assembly . The plunger pressure sensor push plate is attached to a plunger pressure sensor lever . The plunger pressure sensor lever is pivotally coupled to a plunger pressure sensor pivot . The plunger pressure sensor pivot is disposed at the left end of the plunger pressure sensor lever relative to . In the example embodiment in any force applied to the plunger pressure sensor push plate is transmitted through the plunger pressure sensor lever to the plunger pressure sensor input surface . Although the location of the plunger pressure sensor pivot in relation to the plunger pressure sensor push plate does not multiply the force exerted against the plunger pressure sensor input surface in other embodiments may use different arrangements to create a mechanical advantage. The plunger pressure sensor in also comprises a plunger pressure sensor force concentrator which is a small projection extending from the plunger pressure sensor lever to the plunger pressure sensor input surface . The plunger pressure sensor force concentrator concentrates force exerted against the plunger pressure sensor input surface to help promote a more accurate pressure reading.

The plunger tube may also serve as a channel for the electrical conduits to and from the plunger clamp jaws position sensor and the plunger pressure sensor . Since the plunger tube is sealed to liquid when the syringe pump is fully assembled the plunger tube protects the electrical conduits from exposure to liquid. The electrical conduits exit the plunger tube through the conduit opening of the plunger tube shown in .

A closer exploded view of the sliding block assembly is shown in . The sliding block assembly comprises a number of parts. The sliding block assembly comprises a half nut housing a barrel cam a half nut and a half nut cover plate . The half nut housing may be manufactured from any suitable strong material will not significantly deform under the applied loads such as metal nylon glass filled plastics molded plastic a polyoxymethylene plastic such as Delrin etc. The half nut is preferably fabricated from bearing metals such as brass bronze etc that interact well with stainless steel surfaces typical of lead screws. The barrel cam is preferably fabricated from a hard metal such as stainless to form a good bearing pair with the half nut . The half nut housing comprises a lead screw void A. The lead screw void A allows the lead screw not shown see to pass through the half nut housing . The lead screw void A has a diameter larger than the lead screw which ensures that the lead screw passes uninhibited through the lead screw void A irrespective of the point on the lead screw at which sliding block assembly is located. The sliding block assembly includes a ribbon cable to receive power from and for communications with the circuit board refer to .

The half nut housing may also comprise a guide rod bushing B. The guide rod bushing B in the example embodiment depicted in is formed as continuous piece of the half nut housing. The guide rod not shown see extends through the guide rod bushing B in the half nut housing with the interior surface of the guide rod bushing B serving as a bearing surface for the guide rod . In some embodiments the guide rod bushing B may not be formed as a continuous part of the half nut housing but rather coupled to the half nut housing in any number of suitable ways. The guide rod bushing B may be made from a lubricious material such as bronze brass PTFE delrin etc which provides a low friction surface to mate with a hard surface of a guide rod .

The half nut housing may also comprise a barrel cam void C. The barrel cam void C may be sized such that it has a diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the barrel cam . When the sliding block assembly is fully assembled the barrel cam may fit into the barrel cam void C on the half nut housing . In some embodiments the barrel cam void C may extend all the way through the half nut housing . In the example embodiment shown in the barrel cam void C does not extend all the way through the half nut housing . The barrel cam void C may function as a bushing for the barrel cam when the sliding block assembly is fully assembled. The barrel cam void C and barrel cam may be manufactured with a clearance fit. In one example the diametrical clearance between the barrel cam void C and the barrel cam is 0.001 to 0.005 inches.

In some embodiments including the embodiment depicted in the half nut housing may include a half nut void D. The half nut void D may be recessed into the half nut housing such that the half nut may fit in the half nut void D when the sliding block assembly is fully assembled. In some embodiments the lead screw void A barrel cam void C and half nut void D may all be part of a single void recessed into the half nut housing .

The half nut housing may comprise a driven shaft aperture E. The driven shaft aperture E extends through the half nut housing and into the barrel cam void C. In the driven shaft D shaped segment or shaft collar is shown protruding into the barrel cam void C through the driven shaft aperture E.

The half nut housing may additionally comprise a half nut housing groove F. In the example embodiment in the half nut housing groove F is recessed into the half nut housing . The half nut housing groove F is recessed along the entire side of the half nut housing . The half nut housing groove F extends in a direction parallel to the direction of elongation of the plunger tube lead screw and guide rod shown e.g. in .

In some embodiments the half nut housing may comprise at least one limit switch G not shown . In the example embodiment depicted in the half nut housing may comprise two limit switches G not shown . One limit switch G is located on the front of the half nut housing and the other limit switch G is located on the back of the half nut housing . The limit switch es G may be used to limit the range of movement of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw . The limit switches G will be further elaborated upon later.

As previously mentioned the barrel cam fits into the barrel cam void C in the half nut housing when the sliding block assembly is fully assembled. As shown the barrel cam comprises a D shaped orifice A which extends through the entire barrel cam along the axial direction of the barrel cam . The D shaped orifice A is sized and shaped to allow the barrel cam to be coupled onto the driven shaft D shaped segment . When the D shaped orifice A of the barrel cam is coupled onto the driven shaft D shaped segment any rotation of the driven shaft and driven shaft D shaped segment causes the barrel cam to rotate as well. The barrel cam may be joined to the driven shaft in any of the standard methods including but not limited to set screws pins adhesive friction fit welds etc.

As shown in the barrel cam is generally a truncated cylinder and comprises a barrel cam flat B which is cut into the barrel cam along a chord of the front facing base of the cylinder of the barrel cam . The barrel cam flat B may be cut such that some distance from the barrel cam center line so that the full diameter of the barrel cam remains. The remaining material of barrel cam on the far side of the centerline relative to the half nut B bearing surface provides a bearing surface to transfer forces from the half nut to the barrel cam void C along the entire length of the barrel cam .

The barrel cam flat B may not extend along the entire barrel cam leaving some of the cylinder of the barrel cam to have an unadulterated classic cylindrical shape. This is desirable because the classic cylindrically shaped portion of the barrel cam may act as a journal within the barrel cam void C which may act as a bushing. In the example embodiment depicted in the barrel cam flat B extends along the barrel cam until a barrel cam shoulder C begins. The barrel cam shoulder C may extend perpendicularly from the surface of the barrel cam flat B. In the example embodiment in the expanse of the barrel cam with the unadulterated classic cylindrical shape is the barrel cam shoulder C.

As shown the barrel cam may also comprise a barrel cam pin D. The barrel cam pin D in the example embodiment in projects perpendicularly from the front facing base of the cylinder of the barrel cam . The barrel cam pin D projects from the front facing base of the barrel cam near the chord from which the barrel cam flat B has been extended into the cylinder of the barrel cam .

The sliding block assembly may also comprise a half nut as mentioned above. In the example embodiment in the half nut comprises a half nut slot . The half nut slot is sized such that it may act as a track way for the barrel cam pin D. The half nut slot comprises an arcuate section A and an end section B which is not curved or arced. The half nut slot may be cut into a half nut slot plate C which extends perpendicularly from a half nut cam follower surface B. The half nut cam follower surface B and the half nut slot will be further elaborated on in the following paragraphs.

The half nut may comprise a guide rod bushing void A. The guide rod bushing void A of the half nut allows the guide rod bushing B to pass through the half nut . In the example embodiment shown in the guide rod bushing void A is substantially larger than the diameter of the guide rod bushing B. Additionally the guide rod bushing void A in the half nut may have an elliptical shape or stadium shape. Such a shape allows the guide rod bushing B to fit comfortably within the guide rod bushing void A when the half nut is engaged disengaged or in transition between either position.

The half nut may also comprise a span of half nut threads C. The half nut threads C are capable of engaging the threads of the lead screw not shown see . In the example embodiment shown in the half nut threads C are V shaped threads. V shaped threads may be desirable because such a shape may help to self align the half nut threads C on the lead screw .

As mentioned above the sliding block assembly may also comprise a sliding block cover plate . The sliding block cover plate may be coupled onto the half nut housing such that the barrel cam and half nut are kept in place within the sliding block assembly when the sliding block assembly is fully assembled. In the example embodiment shown in the sliding block cover plate may be coupled onto the half nut housing by sliding block cover plate screws A as shown or by any suitable means such as but not limited to bolts adhesive snap fit friction fit magnets welds a tongue in groove arrangement pin etc. The sliding block cover plate may comprise a cover plate groove B to assist in guiding the half nut housing . The cover plate groove B may be recessed into the sliding block cover plate . In the example embodiment shown in the cover plate groove B is recessed along an entire side edge of the sliding block cover plate . The cover plate groove B may sized and disposed such that it lines up with the half nut housing groove F on the half nut housing .

The sliding block cover plate may comprise a guide rod bushing aperture C. The guide rod bushing aperture C is sized and disposed such that the guide rod bushing B may project through the guide rod bushing aperture C. The guide rod bushing aperture C may have a diameter substantially equal to or slightly larger than the outer diameter of the guide rod bushing B.

The edge of the sliding block cover plate opposite the cover plate groove B may comprise a lead screw trough D. The lead screw trough D may be an arced section recessed into the edge of the sliding block cover plate . The lead screw trough D in conjunction with the lead screw void A of the half nut housing allows the sliding block assembly to be placed on the lead screw .

In operation the sliding block assembly may be caused to move along the axial direction of the lead screw and guide rod as a result of lead screw rotation. The sliding block assembly may also be moved along the axial direction of the lead screw and guide rod by a user. For a user to move the sliding block assembly along the axial direction of the lead screw the user may need to adjust the location of the plunger head assembly relative to the rest of the syringe pump assembly as shown and described in relation to . This may only be done by a user when the half nut is not engaged with the lead screw

To move the half nut between an engaged and disengaged position on the lead screw the barrel cam must be rotated. As the barrel cam is rotated the barrel cam pin D may move along the half nut slot in the half nut slot plate C. In the example embodiment shown in when the barrel cam pin D is located in the arcuate section A of the half nut slot the half nut is engaged with the lead screw . The arcuate section A of the half nut slot may be shaped such that any movement of the barrel cam pin D within the arcuate section A of the half nut slot does not result in any movement of the half nut .

When the barrel cam is rotated such that the barrel cam pin D enters the straight end section B of the half nut slot further rotation of the barrel cam may cause the half nut to disengage from the lead screw . The straight nature of the end section B ensures that the further rotation of the barrel cam causes the barrel cam pin D to pull the half nut away from the lead screw until the barrel cam pin D reaches the end of the end section B. Rotation of the barrel cam in the opposite direction will cause the barrel cam pin D to push the half nut back into engagement with the lead screw .

In the example embodiment in when the barrel cam has disengaged the half nut from the lead screw the half nut cam follower surface B rests in the void created by the barrel cam flat B. When the half nut is disengaged the distance between the half nut threads C and their point of full engagement on the lead screw is less than or equal to the length of the sagitta of the cylindrical segment removed from the barrel cam to create the barrel cam flat B. As the barrel cam is rotated to engage the half nut with the lead screw the pin D in the straight end section B moves the half nut toward the lead screw until the half nut is at least partial engaged with the lead screw . As the pin D exits the end section B the untruncated arc of barrel cam rotates onto the half nut cam follower surface B of the half nut . The untruncated arc of the barrel may push the half nut into full engagement with the lead screw and supplements the action of the barrel cam pin D in the half nut slot .

Referring back to the example embodiment shown in the driven shaft to which the barrel cam is coupled may not deflect when the barrel cam has engaged disengaged or is transitioning the half nut from an engaged or disengaged position on the lead screw . As shown the barrel cam void C in the half nut housing supports the barrel cam when the sliding block assembly is fully assembled. Consequently any force promoting deflection of the driven shaft is checked by the barrel cam abutting the sides of the barrel cam void C. This ensures that the half nut threads C may not skip on the threads of the lead screw under high axial loads. It also creates minimal drag as the sliding block assembly travels along the lead screw with rotation of the lead screw .

In some embodiments the fit of the half nut and the barrel cam may be adjustable. In such embodiments a portion of the barrel cam housing that defines the barrel cam void C may have an adjustable position relative to the guide rod that can be adjusted for example by rotation of a set screw or other adjustment means. This may also allow a user to adjust the barrel cam to an optimal or near optimal position. Alternatively inserts may be added to the barrel cam void C or the barrel cam may be replaced with different sized barrel cam to position the half nut D barrel cam interface at the optimal location. In such a position the barrel cam may engage the half nut threads C on the lead screw such that there is zero or minimal backlash without loading the half nut threads C against the lead screw and creating excessive drag.

In alternate embodiments the barrel cam pin D may be optional. In some alternate embodiments the barrel cam pin D may be replaced by one or more bias members. The bias members may bias the half nut to the disengaged position. In such embodiments rotation of the barrel cam may cause the half nut engage or disengage with the lead screw . When the barrel cam flat B is not contacting the half nut cam follower surface B the one or more bias members may be overcome and the half nut threads C may be engaged with the threads of the lead screw . As the barrel cam flat B rotates onto the half nut cam follower surface B the bias member s may act as a spring return which automatically biases the half nut out of engagement with the lead screw and against the barrel cam flat B. The barrel cam may include a transitional cam surface between the barrel cam flat B and the untruncated arc of barrel cam to facilitate displacing the half nut toward the lead screw . Use of the barrel cam pin D may be desirable because such an arrangement requires less torque to engage or disengage the half nut than embodiments which may employ one or more bias members as a substitute. Some embodiments may use both the barrel cam pin D and one or more bias members to effect engagement or disengagement of the half nut .

In some embodiments the bias member may bias the half nut towards the engaged position in which case the barrel cam pin may be configured to lift the half nut threads C off the lead screw .

In another alternative embodiment the barrel cam may not comprise a barrel cam pin D and the half nut may not comprise a half nut slot . In such embodiments the barrel cam flat B may comprise a magnet and the half nut cam follower surface B may also comprise a magnet. Instead of using the barrel cam pin D to pull the half nut away from the lead screw the magnet on the half nut cam follower surface B may be attracted to the magnet on the barrel cam flat B and be pulled off the lead screw toward the barrel cam flat B when the barrel cam has been rotated the appropriate amount. In some embodiments the barrel cam may be a simple two pole magnet. In such embodiments the barrel cam may be disposed such that it may repel or attract a magnet on the half nut cam follower surface B. When like poles of the magnets face each other the half nut is forced into engagement with the lead screw . By rotating the driven shaft and therefore the magnetic barrel cam opposite poles may be made to face each other. In turn this may cause the half nut to disengage from the lead screw as it is attracted to the magnetic barrel cam .

In some embodiments a magnet may be configured to bias the half nut towards the engaged position in which case the barrel cam pin may be configured to lift the half nut threads C off of the lead screw .

The guide rod is also visible in . In the guide rod extends in an axial direction parallel to that of the lead screw . The guide rod passes through the guide rod bushing void A in the half nut . In the example embodiment the guide rod is made of a hard and durable material. For example in some embodiments the guide rod may be made of a material such as stainless steel. In other embodiments the guide rod may be chromium plated.

The barrel cam has been rotated such that the barrel cam pin D is about to cross from the arcuate section A of the half nut slot and into the end section B of the half nut slot in . As shown the half nut threads C have not moved from the engaged position and are still at the far left extent relative to of their range of movement. Similarly the half nut may not have moved relative to the guide rod bushing B from the position depicted and described in relation to .

In the barrel cam has been rotated such that the barrel cam pin D has moved into the straight end section B of the half nut slot . As described above further rotation of the barrel cam once the barrel cam pin D enters the end section B of the half nut slot causes the half nut to disengage. As shown the half nut and consequentially the half nut threads C have moved from the far left extent relative to of their range of movement and toward the right of the page. The half nut has moved in relation to the guide rod bushing B such that the guide rod bushing B is now near the far left end of the guide rod bushing void A.

In the example embodiment shown in the half nut is in the disengaged position. The half nut threads C are not operatively interdigitated with the threads of the lead screw . The guide rod bushing B is near the top of the guide rod bushing void A in the half nut . The half nut cam follower surface B is near or is abbuting depending on the embodiment the barrel cam flat B on the barrel cam . Additionally the barrel cam pin D is at the end of the straight end section B of the half nut slot which is cut into the half nut slot plate C.

The rear face of the syringe pump assembly may comprise a gearbox depression . As shown the gearbox depression is recessed into the rear face of the syringe pump assembly . In the example embodiment the gearbox depression is a roughly rectangular shaped depression. In other embodiments the gearbox depression may have alternative shapes.

As shown in an anti rotation pin projects out of the gearbox depression . The anti rotation pin in the example embodiment shown in is cylindrical. In alternate embodiments the anti rotation pin may take any other suitable shape. As shown in the gearbox depression in the rear face of the syringe pump assembly may also comprise a lead screw void . The lead screw void may be cut all the way through the rear face of the syringe pump assembly and allow at least a portion of the lead screw to project beyond of the rear face of the syringe pump assembly . As shown in the example embodiment the section of the lead screw which projects beyond the rear face of the syringe pump assembly is not threaded.

In the example embodiment shown in the section of the lead screw that is visible is smaller in diameter than the lead screw void . This is desirable because it may allow a rear face lead screw bearing to be placed in the lead screw void to provide a bearing surface for the lead screw . In the example embodiment in a lead screw bearing is disposed in the lead screw void to provide a bearing surface for the lead screw .

As shown the end of the of the section of the lead screw which projects out of the rear face may comprise a threaded bore . In the example embodiment shown in a gearbox attachment fastener is coupled into the threaded bore on the end of the lead screw . In the example embodiment the gearbox attachment fastener is a screw with a hex socket head. In other embodiments any other suitable fastener or fastener head may be used.

In another view of a portion of an embodiment of the syringe pump assembly is shown. At the left side of part of the plunger head assembly is also visible. The gearbox is shown in place in the gearbox depression on the rear face of the syringe pump assembly . As shown the anti rotation pin may project through an anti rotation pin hole in the gearbox . The anti rotation pin ensures that the gearbox causes rotation of the lead screw and that the gearbox may not rotate around the axis of the lead screw . As shown the anti rotation pin does not help to hold the gearbox against the rear face of the syringe pump assembly . In alternate embodiments the anti rotation pin may have a threaded anti rotation pin bore not shown similar to that of the end of the lead screw described in above in relation to . An anti rotation pin gearbox fastener may be threaded into the thread anti rotation pin bore to help hold the gearbox against the back face of the syringe pump assembly . The gearbox may be friction locked onto the lead screw to ensure that rotation of the gears in the gearbox is transmitted to the lead screw with zero or minimal backlash.

In embodiments where the syringe pump assembly may be removed from the housing see and replaced with another assembly such as a peristaltic large volume pump assembly the gearbox may be compatible with a replacement assembly.

As shown one end of the guide rod is seated in the rear face guide rod hole . The other end of the guide rod is seated in the front face of the syringe pump assembly . In the example embodiment depicted in the end of the guide rod facing the front of the page is smaller in diameter than the rest of the guide rod . This section of the guide rod may be placed in a guide rod hole in the front face of the syringe pump assembly when the syringe pump assembly is fully assembled. The guide rod hole may extend through the entire front face of the syringe pump assembly at an angle substantially perpendicular to the front face . The smaller diameter section of the guide rod may have a diameter slightly though not substantially smaller than the diameter of the guide rod hole such that the guide rod may fit snuggly in the guide rod hole when the syringe pump assembly is assembled. The end of the guide rod may be flush with the plane of the front face of the syringe pump assembly . Though both the guide rod hole and the section of the guide rod seated in the guide rod hole are cylindrical in the example embodiment shown in their shape may differ in alternate embodiments.

The lead screw is seated in a lead screw depression in the front face of the syringe pump assembly . In the example embodiment shown in the depth of the lead screw depression is substantially the thickness of the front face of the syringe pump assembly . In embodiments where the depth of the lead screw depression is substantially the depth of the front face a circular plateau may be raised off the front face of the syringe pump assembly to accommodate the depth of the lead screw depression . The center of the circular plateau may be concentric with the center of a cylindrical lead screw depression as shown in . In some embodiments the edges of the circular plateau may extend perpendicularly from the front face of the syringe pump assembly to the raised circular plateau. In the example embodiment illustrated in the edges of the circular plateau curve up from the front face of the syringe pump assembly to the circular plateau .

As shown the lead screw depression may house a front face lead screw bearing which surrounds the end of the lead screw and provides a bearing surface for the lead screw . In some embodiments such as the embodiment depicted in a Belleville washer may be seated against the bottom of the lead screw depression . The Belleville washer may ensure that there is no play of the lead screw when the lead screw is seated in the lead screw depression .

In some embodiments the Belleville washer may be replaced by non compliant end cap which loads the front face lead screw bearing against the lead screw . In such embodiments the end cap may be threaded on its out diameter. The lead screw depression may feature complimentary threads to which the end cap may screw into. Again the end cap may also ensure that there is no play of the lead screw when the lead screw is seated in the lead screw depression .

Movement of the sliding block assembly is also guided by a syringe pump assembly guide rail . In the example embodiment shown in the syringe pump assembly guide rail extends from the interior face of the syringe seat . The syringe pump assembly guide rail is shaped such that the half nut housing groove F and cover plate groove B on the sliding block assembly may fit on the syringe pump assembly guide rail and slide along the syringe pump assembly guide rail . The syringe pump assembly guide rail also ensures that the sliding block assembly may not rotate within the syringe pump assembly . The syringe pump assembly guide rail may be formed as part of the extrusion in embodiments where the syringe pump assembly housing is formed by extrusion.

As shown in when half nut of the sliding block assembly is engaged with the lead screw the lead screw may cause linear movement of the sliding block assembly along the axial direction of the lead screw . To cause linear movement of the sliding block assembly the lead screw must be rotated. In the example embodiment in the rotational motion of the lead screw causes the half nut and consequently the sliding block assembly to move along the lead screw due to the pitch of the threads of the lead screw . The amount of linear movement per 360 rotation of the lead screw may vary depending on the pitch of the threads of the lead screw which may differ in various embodiments.

As mentioned above the half nut housing of the sliding block assembly may comprise one or more limit switches G. In the example embodiment in a limit switch G is not shown although it is indicated that a limit switch G may be located on the front of the half nut housing . In other embodiments there may be multiple limit switches G which may be disposed about other portions of the sliding block assembly . In embodiments where a limit switch may be disposed on the front of the half nut housing the limit switch G may prevent the sliding block assembly from being driven into the front face shown in of the syringe pump assembly .

In embodiments comprising a limit switch G the limit switch G may be a micro switch although hall sensors and magnets optical sensors etc. could also be used. In embodiments where the limit switch G comprises a micro switch the micro switch may be actuated when the sliding block assembly nears a predefined location along the lead screw . In some embodiments when the limit switch G is in the actuated position the lead screw may not be further rotated to advance the sliding block assembly in the direction of the predefined location.

As shown in the syringe pump assembly may additionally comprise a sliding block linear position sensor to determine the sliding block assembly s location on the lead screw . In some embodiments the sliding block linear position sensor may be used to determine the amount of contents left in a syringe which may be in place on the syringe pump assembly . In such embodiments the sliding block linear position sensor may be used to determine a quantified volume of syringe contents or may be used as a gas gauge which generates a more general syringe contents volume reading.

In some embodiments the sliding block linear position sensor may comprise a linear potentiometer. In such embodiments the wiper of the sliding block linear position sensor may be disposed such that it slides across the resistive element of the potentiometer with movement of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw . The resistance measured by the sliding block linear position sensor may be used to determine the location of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw .

In some embodiments including the example embodiment shown in the sliding block linear position sensor may comprise an array of sliding block magnetic linear position sensors . The sliding block magnetic linear position sensors may be any suitable magnetic linear position sensor. An example of a suitable magnetic linear position sensor is the AS5410 Absolute Linear 3D Hall Encoder available from Austriamicrosystems of Austria. As shown the sliding block assembly may include a sliding block assembly magnet which is mounted a suitable distance away from the sliding block magnetic linear position sensors and may be used in conjunction with the array of sliding block magnetic linear position sensors in order to determine the location of the sliding block assembly on the lead screw . In some embodiments the location of the sliding block magnetic linear position sensors may differ. As shown the sliding block includes a second magnet disposed such that it may interact with the sliding block magnetic linear position sensors when they are placed in an alternate location.

In the example linear position sensor arrangement shown in the position changing block comprises a position changing block magnet . As shown the position changing block magnet is located on the face of the position changing block closest to the array of magnetic linear position sensors . The position changing block magnet is a dipole magnet. The north pole of the position changing block magnet is oriented to face toward the right of the page while the south pole faces the left of the page. As the position changing block moves along the position changing block lead screw the position changing block magnet also moves. This movement may be measured by the array of magnetic linear position sensors and analyzed to determine an absolute location of the position changing block along the position changing block lead screw . In some embodiments the array of magnetic linear position sensors may be used to determine differential movements of the position changing block .

As shown in an embodiment of the sliding block assembly is shown assembled with the half nut cover plate see removed. The half nut is depicted in the engaged position and is shown as transparent so that the half nut housing and the barrel cam may be seen behind it. The driven shaft D shaped segment of the driven shaft is shown in the D shaped orifice A of the barrel cam . The driven shaft extends through the plunger tube which couples the sliding block assembly and plunger head assembly together.

Referring back to the driven shaft couples into a double universal joint . The double universal joint translates any rotational motion from the dial which rotates the dial shaft to rotational motion of the driven shaft . Rotational motion of the driven shaft in turn causes rotation of the barrel cam . Rotation of the barrel cam engages or disengages the half nut as described above.

As also detailed above rotation of the dial causes linear displacement of the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw . The dial is thus multi functional. When rotated the dial both engages or disengages the half nut and opens or closes the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw . It should be noted that the arcuate section A of the half nut slot is shaped such that the half nut does not begin to disengage until the largest plunger flange not shown which can be accepted by the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw has been released by the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw . When the plunger flange not shown has been released and the half nut has disengaged the dial shaft cam follower on the dial shaft may sit in the dial shaft cam detents of the dial shaft cam as described in relation to . As put forth in the detailed description of this would allow a user to park the dial in the fully rotated position where the half nut is disengaged and the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw are in the open position. In the example embodiment depicted in when the dial is in the parked position a user may remove their hand from the dial and easily adjust the plunger head assembly so that a syringe not shown may be inserted onto the syringe pump assembly see for example illustrations and discussion of syringe placement onto the syringe pump assembly .

The plunger position sensors may be any of the plunger position sensors described herein. The barrel diameter sensor may be the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors to be described herein. The plunger capture potentiometer sensor may not necessarily be a potentiometer sensor in all embodiments. In some embodiments the plunger capture potentiometer sensor may be the plunger clamp jaws position sensor described herein. The plunger force sensor may be the plunger pressure sensor described herein. The plunger capture potentiometer may be a switch to detect a syringe loaded into the syringe seat . The above sensors may communicate signals respective of and indicative of what they are sensing to the RTP or another component.

As shown in a thermistor may provide a signal to the RTP indicative of the temperature of the infusate in an infusion line. Alternatively the thermistor may measure a temperature in the syringe pump or the temperature of the circuit . As shown the electrical system defines specific part numbers for various components. For example the thermistor is defined as a 2X SEMITEC 103JT 050 ADMIN Set THERMISTOR . These part numbers should not be construed as limiting in any way whatsoever. In different embodiments suitable replacement components may be used in place of the specific parts listed in the . For example the thermistor may not be a 2X SEMITEC 103JT 050 ADMIN Set THERMISTOR but rather any suitable replacement thermistor . In some embodiments the electrical system may comprise additional components. In some embodiments the electrical system may comprises fewer components than the number of components shown in .

Two sensors which may be located downstream of the syringe pump are shown in . One sensor is an air in line sensor . The other is an occlusion sensor . Both are connected to the RTP . These sensors are optional. The air in line sensor may detect the presence of air in the section of an infusion line in near the air in line sensor . In an example embodiment the air in line sensor may comprise an ultra sonic sensor B a logic unit A and a signal conditioning unit C. In some embodiments the syringe pump may not comprise an air in line sensor .

The occlusion sensor may measure the internal pressure of an infusate in an infusion line. In some embodiments the occlusion sensor may be the downstream pressure sensor described herein. In an example embodiment the occlusion sensor may comprise a force sensor B an amplifier A a signal amplifier C and a buffer D. The buffer D may protect the RTP from over voltages due to high forces generated from pressures applied to the force sensor B. In alternative embodiments the occlusion sensor may differ.

The watch dog circuit is shown in . The watch dog circuit may enabled by an I2C command from the RTP . The watch dog circuit may signal an error and disable the motor controller e.g. via chip if it does not receive a signal from the RTP at a specified frequency. The watch dog circuit may signal the user via an audible alarm. The audible alarm may be issued via an amplifier and or backup speaker . The watch dog circuit may signal the user with visual alarm LEDs shown in if an abnormal condition is detected. In one embodiment the RTP must clear the watchdog between 10 ms and 200 ms after the watch dog circuit s last clear. In some embodiments the watch dog circuit is comprised of a window watchdog A a logic circuit B which may include one or more flip flop switches and an IO expander C that communicates with the RTP over an I2C bus. A backup battery see may provide power to the watch dog circuit and backup speaker system which may comprise an audio amplifier and a backup speaker in case the main battery see fails. The backup battery may provide power to the RTP and UIP to maintain the internal timekeeping which may be especially desirable when the main battery is changed. The RTP may also monitor the voltage of the backup battery with a switch such as the FAIRCHILD FPF1005 LOAD SWITCH shown in .

The RTP directly controls the speed and position of the motor . The motor may be any of a number of types of motors including a brushed DC motor a stepper motor or a brushless DC motor. In the embodiment illustrated in the syringe pump is driven by a brushless direct current BLDC servo motor . In one example embodiment the RTP receives signals from the hall sensors of a brushless DC motor and does the calculations to commutate power to the winding of the motor to achieve a desired speed or position. The commutation signals may be sent to the motor controller which selectively connects the windings to the motor power supply . The motor may be monitored for damaging or dangerous operation via current sensors and a temperature sensor A.

The signals from the hall sensors may be supplied to both the RTP and to an encoder . In one embodiment three hall signals are generated. Any two of the three hall signals may be sent to the encoder . The encoder may use these signals to provide a position signal to the UIP . The UIP estimates the total volume of fluid dispensed by the syringe pump from the position signal of the encoder . In some specific embodiments each syringe pump may be calibrated during assembly to establish the nominal volume stroke that may be stored in memory. The UIP estimated volume may then be compared at regular intervals to the volume which would be expected for a commanded therapy. In some embodiments the interval between comparisons may be shorter for different infusates for example short half life infusates. The therapy may specify among other parameters a flow rate duration and a total volume to be infused VTBI . In any case the expected volume based on the programmed therapy at a given time during that therapy may be calculated and compared to the volume estimated by the UIP . The UIP may signal an alert or alarm if the difference between UIP estimated volume and the expected volume for therapy is outside of a predefined threshold. The UIP may signal an alarm if the difference between UIP estimated volume and the expected volume for the therapy is outside another predefined threshold.

The UIP may also compare the estimated volume to the volume reported by the RTP . The UIP may signal an alert if the difference between UIP estimated volume and the RTP reported volume is outside a predefined threshold. The UIP may signal an alarm if the difference between UIP estimated volume and the RTP reported volume is outside a second threshold.

In some embodiments the UIP may compare the RTP reported volume to the expected volume for the therapy and signal an alert if the two values differ by more than a predefined threshold. The UIP may signal an alarm if the difference between the RTP reported volume and the expected volume for the therapy differ by more than another predefined threshold. The values of the alert and alarm thresholds may be different for comparisons between different sets of volumes. The thresholds may be stored memory. The thresholds may vary depending on a number of different parameters such as but not limited to medication medication concentration clinical usage patient therapy type or location. The thresholds may be predefined in a DERS Drug Error Reduction System database and downloaded from the device gateway server.

An RFID tag see may be connected by an I2C bus to the UIP and to a near field antenna . The RFID tag may be used by med techs or other users or personnel to acquire or store information when the syringe pump is in an unpowered state. The UIP may store service logs error codes etc. in the RFID tag . The service logs error codes etc. may be accessible by an RFID reader. A med tech for example could inspect unpowered syringe pumps in storage or evaluate non functioning syringe pumps by using an RFID reader to interrogate the RFID tag . In another example a med tech or other personnel may perform service on the syringe pump and store any related service information in the RFID tag . The UIP may then cull the latest service information from the RFID tag and store it in memory see .

The main battery may supply all the power to the syringe pump . The main battery may be connected via a system power gating element to the motor power supply . All of the sensors and processors described herein may be powered by one of the several voltage regulators see . The main battery may be charged from AC power via a battery charger and a AC DC converter . The UIP be connected to one or more memory chips .

The UIP controls the main audio system which comprises a main speaker and the audio chips audio codec audio amplifier see . The main audio system may be capable of producing a range of sounds indicating for example alerts and alarms. The audio system may also provide confirmatory sounds to facilitate and improve user interaction with the display and or data input means see . The main audio system may include a microphone which may be used to confirm the operation of the main speaker as well as the backup speaker . The main audio system may produce one or more tones modulation sequences and or patterns of sound and the audio codec chip may compare the signal received from the microphone to the signal sent to the main speaker . The use of one or more tones and comparison of signals may allow the system to confirm main speaker function independently of any ambient noise. Alternatively the UIP or the audio codec may confirm that the microphone produces a signal at the same time a signal is sent to the speaker amplifier .

The UIP may provide a range of different wireless signals for different uses. The UIP may communicate with the hospital wireless network via a dual band WiFi using chips and and antennas and . The spatially diverse dual antenna may be desirable because in may be capable of overcoming dead spots within a room due to multiple paths and cancellation. A hospital device gateway may communicate DERS CQI Continuous Quality Improvement prescriptions patient data etc. to the syringe pump via the WiFi system.

The Bluetooth system using the same chips and see and antennas and see may provide a convenient method to connect auxiliaries to the syringe pump that may include pulse oximeters blood pressure readers bar code readers tablets phones etc. The Bluetooth may include version 4.0 to allow low power auxiliaries which may communicate with the syringe pump periodically such as for example a continuous glucose meter that sends an update once a minute.

The NFC system may be comprised of an NFC controller see and an antenna see . The NFC controller may also be referred to as an RFID reader. The NFC system may be used to read RFID chips identifying drugs or other inventory information. The RFID chips may also be used to identify patients and caregivers. The NFC controller may also interact with a similar RFID reader on for example a phone or tablet computer to input information including prescriptions bar code information patient care giver identities etc. The NFC controller may also provide information to phone or tablet computers such as the syringe pump history or service conditions. The RFID antennas and and or NFC antenna may preferably be located around or near the display screen so all interaction with the syringe pump occurs on or near the display whether reading an RFID chip or interacting with a touch screen display or other data input means near the display.

The UIP may include a medical grade connector see so that other medical devices may plug into the syringe pump and provide additional capabilities. The connector may implement a USB interface.

The display may include the RFID antennas the NFC antenna the display the touch screen an LCD backlight driver a light sensor a 16 channel LED driver LED indicator lights and and three buttons . The buttons may collectively be referred to herein as data input means . The display may include a backlight and an ambient light sensor to allow the display brightness to automatically respond and or adjust to ambient light. The first button may be the Power button while another button may be an infusion stop button. These buttons may not provide direct control of the syringe pump but rather provide a signal to the UIP to either initiate or terminate infusion. The third button may silence an alarm or alert at the main speaker and at the backup speaker . Silencing the alarm or alert will not clear the fault but may end the audible alarm or alert. The electrical system described above or an alternative embodiment of the electrical system described above may be used with the syringe pump described herein.

As shown a motor is operatively coupled to the gearbox in . Rotation of the motor is transmitted through the gearbox to drive the rotation of the lead screw . As described above since the upper plunger clamp jaw and lower plunger clamp jaw are closed on the plunger flange the half nut is engaged with the lead screw . Consequently in the embodiment depicted in as the motor causes the lead screw to rotate the sliding block assembly will travel along the axial length of the lead screw . As motor rotates the lead screw such that the sliding block assembly moves toward the left of the page relative to the sliding block assembly s movement will additionally cause the plunger tube and plunger head assembly to displace toward the left of the page. As the plunger head assembly displaces toward the left of the page the syringe plunger is advanced into the syringe barrel of the syringe and the contents of the syringe are dispensed.

The motor may be any suitable motor . As shown in a small profile pancake motor may be used to drive the rotation of the lead screw . The embodiment shown in does not use a pancake motor . The motor shown in is an alternative motor that also has hall sensors to inform commutation of the motor . As shown in the motor may comprise a magnet on the rotor that is detected by a rotary encoder . The rotary encoder may be any of a variety of suitable rotary encoders such as the AS5055 by Austrianmicrosystems of Austria. In some embodiments the rotary encoder may be a magnetic. The rotary encoder may be used to monitor rotation of the lead screw . Information from the rotary encoder may be used to determine when a given amount of the contents of the syringe has been dispensed. Additionally the rotary encoder may be used to determine the location of the sliding block assembly on the lead screw .

To ensure that the rotary encoder is functioning properly a self test may be preformed. The motor may be powered to move the sliding block assembly back and forth along a distance of the lead screw . Measurements from the rotary encoder may be confirmed against the measurements of the sliding block assembly linear position sensor . The same self test may also be used to confirm the hall sensors of the brushless motor are functioning properly.

As previously indicated the syringe pump includes a number of sensor redundancies. This allows the syringe pump to function in a fail operative mode if deemed appropriate. In the event that the rotary encoder fails the hall sensors of the brushless motor may be used in a fail operative mode to measure the dispensation of syringe contents via the rotation of the motor and provide a feed back signal for the motor controller. Alternatively the location of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw may be used in a fail operative mode to measure the dispensation of syringe contents via position of the sliding block assembly and provide a feed back signal for the controller. Alternatively the sliding block assembly linear position sensor may be used to monitor the dispensation of syringe contents via position of the sliding block assembly on the lead screw and to provide a feed back signal for the controller. In some embodiments the motor hall sensors or the linear sliding block assembly linear position sensor may be used to monitor the position of the sliding block assembly on the lead screw to avoid driving the sliding block assembly against the pump frame.

In the event of a failure of the rotary encoder the syringe pump may finish a therapy if a therapy is in progress and disallow a user from commencing another therapy until the syringe pump has been serviced. In the event of a failure of the rotary encoder the syringe pump may alarm. In some embodiments if the rotary encoder fails and the motor is being used to deliver at a low flow rate the syringe pump may not finish the therapy. If such a failure occurs the syringe pump may alarm and the syringe pump may finish a therapy if a therapy is in progress and disallow a user from commencing another therapy until the syringe pump has been serviced. The controller of the syringe pump may base its decision to continue a therapy based on the risk level of the infusate being delivered to a patient. If the risk of non delivery to a user is higher than the risk of delivering with reduced accuracy the syringe pump will deliver in a fail operative mode.

As shown in the outward edge of the barrel flange clip bows out toward the left of the page. This helps to guide the syringe barrel flange into the gap between the barrel flange clip and the syringe pump assembly . The barrel flange clip may also include one or a number of cutouts . In the example embodiment in the cutouts of the barrel flange clip comprise two valleys. The first valley is recessed into the center span of the outward edge of the barrel flange clip . The second valley which is recessed into the lowest span of the first valley is considerably smaller and shallower. In other embodiments the cutouts may be different in shape size etc. The plunger of the small syringe in is located entirely within the cutouts in the barrel flange clip . Without the cutouts in the barrel flange clip the plunger of the syringe would contact the outward edge of the barrel flange clip and obstruct user placement of the syringe barrel flange into the gap between the barrel flange clip and the syringe pump assembly .

As shown in the barrel flange clip may also include a roughly semi circular depression which thins the barrel flange clip . The roughly semi circular depression may be included to accommodate the plunger flange not shown of a syringe . In embodiments where the barrel flange clip includes the roughly semi circular depression the plunger may be advanced a distance equal to the depth of the semi circular depression further into the syringe barrel . This is desirable because it allows more of the contents of the syringe to be administered to a patient.

As shown in the barrel flange clip may include a barrel flange sensor . The barrel flange sensor may be comprised of any number of suitable sensors. In some embodiments the barrel flange sensor may function in a binary yes no manner to indicate whether a syringe barrel flange is clipped by the barrel flange clip . In some embodiments the barrel flange sensor may comprise a micro switch which is actuated as the syringe barrel flange is placed in the gap between the syringe pump assembly and the barrel flange clip . In other embodiments the barrel flange sensor may comprise a photosensor. Insertion of the syringe barrel flange into the gap between the syringe pump assembly and the barrel flange clip may block a light source for the barrel flange sensor in embodiments where the barrel flange sensor comprises a photosensor. In such embodiments the barrel flange sensor may indicate a syringe barrel flange is clipped in place when the light source is blocked. In other embodiments the barrel flange sensor may be comprised of a different sensor than those described above. The barrel flange sensor may be caused generate an alarm in the event that other sensors such as the plunger clamp jaws position sensor mentioned above or the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor see detect a syringe in place of the syringe pump assembly when the barrel flange sensor does not detect a syringe in place and an initiation of a therapy is attempted.

As shown in the planate base plate may have a base plate slot cut into it. The base plate slot may be cut into the planate base plate from the left edge relative to of the planate base plate . The base plate slot may extend into the planate base plate at an angle substantially perpendicular to the left edge of the planate base plate . The base plate slot does not extend all the way across the planate base plate and stops short of the right edge.

On the flanks of the base plate slot one or more syringe barrel holder housing posts may be disposed. In the example embodiment shown in four syringe barrel holder housing posts flank the base plate slot . The four syringe barrel holder housing posts are divided up such that there are two syringe barrel holder housing posts on each flank of the base plate slot . The syringe barrel holder housing posts extend substantially perpendicularly from the top face of the planate base plate toward the top of the page. The syringe barrel holder housing posts in the example embodiment shown in have the form of rectangular prisms. In alternate embodiment the syringe barrel housing posts may be cylindrical or have any other suitable shape.

The planate base plate may also comprise one or more syringe barrel holder housing bodies . In the example embodiment shown in there are two syringe barrel holder housing bodies . The syringe barrel holder housing bodies projects perpendicularly from the top of the planate base plate toward the top of the page. The syringe barrel holder housing bodies have the form of rectangular prisms. As shown the syringe barrel holder housing bodies may overhang the right edge of the planate base plate . The syringe barrel holder housing bodies may comprise one side which is flush with the front edge or back edge relative to of the planate base plate .

In some embodiments the syringe barrel holder housing may comprise a T shaped member . In the example embodiment shown in the stem portion of the T shaped member extends toward the right of the page from the right edge of the planate base plate . The T shaped member may extend on a plane substantially parallel to the plane of the planate base plate . In the example embodiment the T shaped member projects from roughly the center of the right edge of the planate base plate . The cross portion of the T shaped member is roughly parallel with the right edge of the planate base plate . The cross portion of the T shaped member overhangs the stem equally on both sides of the stem.

As shown in syringe barrel holder guide rails may extend substantially perpendicularly from the right face of the syringe barrel holder housing member and into the left faces of the overhanging cross portions of the T shaped member . The syringe barrel holder guide rails may extend substantially parallel to each other. In the example embodiment shown in a coil spring surrounds each syringe barrel holder guide rail . One end of each coil spring may abut the left face of the cross portion of the T shaped member . In the example embodiment the coil springs are compression springs. In alternate embodiments other bias members or bias member arrangements may be utilized.

As shown in the embodiment in a syringe barrel holder printed circuit board PCB may be held in place on the syringe barrel holder housing posts . The syringe barrel holder PCB may be coupled in place on the syringe barrel holder housing posts by any suitable means. In the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder PCB is coupled to the syringe barrel holder housing posts by screws.

The syringe barrel holder may also comprise a syringe barrel holder arm rod . In the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder arm rod extends through an appropriately sized bore in the approximate center of the T shaped member only the stem of the T shaped member is visible in . The syringe barrel holder arm rod may be movably coupled to the syringe barrel holder . In embodiments where the syringe barrel holder arm rod is movably coupled to the syringe barrel holder the syringe barrel holder arm rod may move along a direction parallel to the edges of the stem of the T shaped member . In the example embodiment in the syringe barrel holder arm rod is able to slide along the bore in the T shaped member and uses the bore in the T shaped member as a linear motion bearing. In the example embodiment the syringe barrel holder arm rod is longer than the length of the stem of the T shaped member .

As shown in one end of the syringe barrel holder arm rod may comprise a collar which may be a U shaped member . The U shaped member may be fixedly coupled to the syringe barrel holder arm rod . In the example embodiment the bottom span of the U shaped member is thicker than the uprights of the U shaped member . The thick bottom span of the U shaped member comprises a hole which allows the U shaped member to be coupled onto the syringe barrel holder arm rod when the syringe barrel holder is assembled. In the example embodiment the uprights of the U shaped member extend up through the base plate slot and are substantially flush with the plane of the top face of the planate base plate . The uprights of the U shaped member may constrain the syringe barrel holder arm rod from rotation since any rotation is blocked by the uprights of the U shaped member abutting the edges of the base plate slot .

In the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder comprises a bias bar . The bias bar in the example embodiment is roughly rectangular in shape. The bias bar may comprise two holes which allow the bias bar to be placed on the syringe barrel holder guide rails . The bias bar may be capable of guided movement along the axial direction of the syringe barrel holder guide rails . In the example embodiment the end of the coil springs on the syringe barrel holder guide rails not abutting the cross portion of the T shaped member abuts the front face of the bias bar . In the example embodiment shown in the maximum distance between the face of the bias bar which one end of the coil springs abut and the face of the T shaped member which the other end of the coil springs abut is shorter than the uncompressed length of the coil springs . This ensures that the bias bar will always be biased toward the position shown in .

As shown in the bias bar may comprise a cutout which allows the bias bar to fit around at least part of the syringe barrel holder arm rod . The U shaped member may abut the face of the bias bar opposite the side which the coil springs abut. In such embodiments the action of the coil springs biasing the bias bar toward the position depicted in additionally biases the syringe barrel holder arm rod to the position depicted in .

In the example embodiment in the syringe barrel holder is shown in the fully open position. To move the syringe barrel holder to the open fully open position a user may grasp the syringe barrel holder grip . In the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder grip is a projection which extends from the barrel contacting structure of the syringe barrel holder which is fixedly coupled to the syringe barrel holder arm rod . After grasping the syringe barrel holder grip a user may pull the syringe barrel holder arm rod away from the syringe barrel holder housing . This action causes the U shaped member which is fixedly attached to the syringe barrel holder arm rod to move as well. Since the U shaped member may not pass through the bias bar the bias bar moves with the U shaped member and syringe barrel holder arm rod . As the bias bar moves along the syringe barrel holder guide rails the coil springs become compressed such that if a user releases the syringe barrel holder grip the restoring force of the coil springs will automatically return the bias bar U shaped member and syringe barrel holder arm rod to the positions shown in .

To hold the syringe barrel holder in the fully open position against the bias of the coil springs the syringe barrel holder may be locked in the open position. As shown the syringe barrel holder may be locked in the open position by rotating the syringe barrel holder arm rod and all parts fixedly coupled to the syringe barrel holder arm rod . In the syringe barrel holder arm rod has been rotated substantially 90 such that the bottom span of the U shaped member is disposed within the base plate notch catch . When the U shaped member is rotated into the base plate notch catch the restoring force of the coil springs is not capable of returning the syringe barrel holder to the position shown in because travel of the U shaped member is blocked by the base plate notch catch .

After rotating the syringe barrel holder arm rod such that the syringe barrel holder is locked in the open position a user may release the syringe barrel holder grip to grasp a syringe not shown and put it in place. As mentioned above the syringe barrel holder will remain in the fully open position. A user may then rotate the syringe barrel holder arm rod 90 back to its original unlocked position and allow the syringe barrel holder to hold the syringe in place.

Referring back to the syringe barrel holder is shown fully open and rotated into the locked position. In the fully open position the syringe barrel contacting structure and syringe barrel holder grip are at their furthest possible distance from the syringe seat of the syringe pump assembly . In some embodiments this distance may be substantially larger than the diameter of the largest syringe which may be accepted by the syringe pump . In a syringe has been put in place against the syringe seat while the syringe barrel holder has be locked in the open position. In the syringe barrel holder has been rotated out of the locked position and has been allowed to automatically adjust to the size of the syringe barrel . As mentioned in the discussion of this automatic adjustment is a result of the restoring force of the coil springs automatically pushing the bias bar U shaped member and the syringe barrel holder arm rod toward the position depicted in .

In an example embodiment of the syringe barrel holder is shown. In the embodiment depicted in the syringe barrel holder PCB is shown as transparent. The syringe barrel holder PCB may comprise one or a number of syringe barrel holder linear position sensors . In the example embodiment there are three syringe barrel holder linear position sensors . The syringe barrel holder linear position sensors may be used to determine the size of the syringe not shown which the syringe barrel holder is holding in place.

In some embodiments there may only be a single syringe barrel holder linear position sensor . In such embodiments the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor may be a linear potentiometer. In embodiments where the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor is a linear potentiometer the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor may comprise a barrel sizing wiper which may slide across the resistive element of the potentiometer with movement of the syringe barrel holder arm rod . When a syringe not shown is held by the syringe barrel holder the size of the syringe not shown will determine the position of the barrel sizing wiper along the linear potentiometer type syringe barrel holder linear position sensor . Since the location of the wiper will vary the resistance measured by the linear position sensor the resistance measured may be used to establish information size volume brand etc. about the syringe not shown being used. In some embodiments the resistance measurement may be referenced with a database or resistance measurements which would be expected from different syringes to determine information about the syringe . The resistance measurement may additionally be used to determine whether a syringe is properly held by the syringe barrel holder . For example if the resistance measurement indicates that the syringe barrel holder is in the fully open position as it is in an alarm may be generated and a therapy may not be initiated.

In some embodiments including the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors may be magnetic linear position sensors. Any suitable magnetic linear position sensor may be used for the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor . The syringe barrel holder linear position sensors may be the same type of sensors as the sliding block assembly linear position sensors . An example of a suitable magnetic linear position sensor is the AS5410 Absolute Linear 3D Hall Encoder available from Austriamicrosystems of Austria. The syringe barrel holder linear position sensors gather their positional data from a syringe barrel holder magnet placed at a suitable distance from the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors . In the example embodiment shown in the syringe barrel holder magnet rests on the bottom span of the U shaped member between the two uprights of the U shaped member . The absolute location of the syringe barrel holder magnet may be measured by the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors . Since the measured absolute location of the syringe barrel holder magnet may vary depending on the syringe not shown being held by the syringe barrel holder the absolute location of the syringe barrel holder magnet can be used to determine specific information for example size volume brand etc. about the syringe not shown being held. In some embodiments the absolute location of the syringe barrel holder magnet may be referenced with a database to determine information about the syringe being utilized. In such embodiments the database may be a database of absolute locations which would be expected with different syringes . The absolute position measurement may also be used to determine whether a syringe is correctly held in place by the syringe barrel holder . For example if the absolute position measurement indicates that the syringe barrel holder is in the fully open position as it is in an alarm may be generated and a therapy may not be initiated.

In some embodiments the data gathered by the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor may be compared to data gathered by other sensors to make a more informed decision on the specific syringe being used. For example in embodiments where a plunger clamp jaws position sensor may make a determination on the type of syringe being used see discussion of the data from the plunger clamp jaws position sensor and linear position sensor may be compared. If the data gathered by the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor does not correlate with data gathered by other sensors an alarm may be generated.

In some embodiments data from the plunger clamp jaws position sensor may be first referenced against a syringe database to narrow down acceptable syringe barrel measurements. In some embodiments data from the syringe barrel holder linear position sensor may be referenced against a syringe database to set a range of acceptable plunger flange measurements.

The moving portion in the example embodiment comprises a moving portion FR 4 PCB substrate . As shown the moving portion FR 4 PCB substrate comprises a moving portion microstrip . The moving portion microstrip may be substantially U shaped. The uprights of the U shaped moving portion microstrip extend parallel to each other and are spaced such that when the line stretcher is assembled they may contact the two microstrips on the stationary portion. The moveable portion microstrips have a width chosen so that it is suitable for desired amount of impedance 50 in the example embodiment . The bottom span of the U shaped movable portion microstrip connects the two uprights of the U shaped movable portion microstrip and is substantially perpendicular to the two uprights. When fully assembled the bottom span of the U shaped movable portion microstrip forms a bridge between the two microstrips on the stationary portion of the line stretcher . Any signal sent through one of the microstrips on the stationary portion may cross via the moving portion microstrip to the other microstrip on the stationary portion. By sliding the moving portion along the direction of extension of the stationary portion microstrips the signal must travel a greater or shorter distance before crossing from one stationary portion microstrip to the other. By manipulating the amount of travel of the signal a user may predictably create a phase change of the signal. To reduce wear on the metal microstrips and a thin sheet of insulation may be placed between the microstrips and creating a capacitive coupling.

As shown in the DIRECTIONAL COUPLER may be replaced with another piece of equipment such as a circulator. The phase change detector in functions very similarly to the phase change detector in . One signal from the power splitter travels directly to the FREQUENCY MIXER . The other signal is delayed. The delay is caused in the same manner as described above. Instead of using a DIRECTIONAL COUPLER however a CIRCULATOR may be used to direct the signal. As the signal enters the CIRCULATOR at port the signal is circulated to port . The signal travels from port to the short or open and is reflected back into port . The reflected phase shifted signal entering port of the CIRCULATOR is circulated to port . The signal exits port and travels to the FREQUENCY MIXER As is well known in the art two identical frequency constant amplitude signals sent to a mixer will result in a DC output which is proportional to the phase difference between the two signals. Since the phase difference is dependent on the distance of the short or open from port of the CIRCULATOR and the distances varies in proportion to the location of the object whose linear location is to be found the DC output of the mixer may be used to determine the objects location.

In some embodiments the phase change detector may be used to substitute for the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors see or the sliding block magnetic linear position sensors see . In some embodiments only one of the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors or the sliding block magnetic linear position sensors may be substituted for with the phase change detector . In some embodiments a phase change detector may be used in conjunction with one or both the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors or the sliding block magnetic linear position sensors and function as a cross check or backup.

In embodiments where the sliding block assembly linear position sensor see is substituted for with a phase change detector the phase change detector may be used to detect the position of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw see . If the phase shift detector uses a line stretcher see the moveable portion of the line stretcher may be caused to move along the stationary portion of the line stretcher with movement of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw . In turn this would cause the degree of phase change to reflect the position of the sliding block assembly on the lead screw . Consequently the DC output voltage of the mixer see may be used to determine the position of the sliding block assembly . The positional data generated by the phase change detector may be used in the same manner as described above in relation to the prior discussion of sliding block assembly linear position sensing.

In embodiments where the phase change detector uses a variable short or open see and movement of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw may cause the short or open to change its location along the transmission line. In turn this would cause the degree of phase change to specify the position of the sliding block assembly along the lead screw . Consequently the DC output voltage of the mixer see and may be used to determine the position of the sliding block assembly .

In embodiments where the syringe barrel holder linear position sensors see is substituted for by the phase change detector the phase change detector may be used to may be used to determine the size of the syringe see . If the phase change detector uses a line stretcher see the moveable portion of the line stretcher may be caused to move along the stationary portion of the line stretcher with movement of the syringe barrel holder arm rod . In turn this would cause the degree of phase change to reflect the position of the syringe barrel holder arm rod . Since the position of the syringe barrel holder arm rod is dependent upon various characteristics of the syringe the DC output voltage of the mixer see may be used to determine the position of the of the syringe barrel holder arm rod and therefore a number of characteristics of the syringe .

In embodiments where the phase change detector uses a variable short or open see and movement of the syringe barrel holder arm rod may cause the short or open to change its location along a transmission line. In turn this would cause the degree of phase change to specify the position of the syringe barrel holder arm rod . Since the position of the syringe barrel holder arm rod is dependent upon various characteristics of the syringe the DC output voltage of the mixer see and may be used to determine the position of the syringe barrel holder arm rod and therefore a number of characteristics of the syringe . The positional data generated by the phase change detector may be used in the same manner as described above in relation to the prior discussion of syringe barrel holder linear position sensing.

An example embodiment of the graphic user interface hereafter GUI is shown in . The GUI enables a user to modify the way that an agent may be infused by the syringe pump by customizing various programming options. Though the following discussion mostly details the use of the GUI with the syringe pump it should be appreciated that the GUI may be used with other pumps including the other pumps mentioned in this specification. For example the GUI may be used with the pump or as shown in detailed in the discussion of . For purposes of example the GUI detailed as follows uses a screen which is a touch screen display see as a means of interaction with a user. In other embodiments the means of interaction with a user may be different. For instance alternate embodiments may comprise user depressible buttons or rotatable dials audible commands etc. In other embodiments the screen may be any electronic visual display such as a liquid crystal display L.E.D. display plasma display etc.

As detailed in the preceding paragraph the GUI is displayed on the display of the syringe pump . Each syringe pump may have its own individual screen . In arrangements where there are multiple syringe pumps or a syringe pump and one or more other pumps the GUI may be used to control multiple pumps. Only the master pump may require a screen . As shown in the pump is seated in a Z frame . As shown the GUI may display a number of interface fields . The interface fields may display various information about the pump infusion status and or the medication etc. In some embodiments the interface fields on the GUI may be touched tapped etc. to navigate to different menus expand an interface field input data and the like. The interface fields displayed on the GUI may change from menu to menu.

The GUI may also have a number of virtual buttons. In the non limiting example embodiment in the display has a virtual power button a virtual start button and a virtual stop button . The virtual power button may turn the syringe pump on or off. The virtual start button may start an infusion. The virtual stop button may pause or stop an infusion. The virtual buttons may be activated by a user s touch tap double tap or the like. Different menus of the GUI may comprise other virtual buttons. The virtual buttons may be skeuomorphic to make their functions more immediately understandable or recognizable. For example the virtual stop button may resemble a stop sign as shown in . In alternate embodiments the names shapes functions number etc. of the virtual buttons may differ.

As shown in the example embodiment in the interface fields of the GUI see may display a number of different programming parameter input fields. For the GUI to display the parameter input fields a user may be required to navigate through one or a number of menus. Additionally it may be necessary for the user to enter a password before the user may manipulate any of the parameter input fields.

In a medication parameter input field in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container parameter input field concentration parameter input field dose parameter input field volume flow rate hereafter abbreviated as rate parameter input field volume to be infused hereafter VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field are displayed. The parameters number of parameters names of the parameters etc. may differ in alternate embodiments. In the example embodiment the parameter input fields are graphically displayed boxes which are substantially rectangular with rounded corners. In other embodiments the shape and size of the parameter input fields may differ.

In the example embodiment the GUI is designed to be intuitive and flexible. A user may choose to populate a combination of parameter input fields which are simplest or most convenient for the user. In some embodiments the parameter input fields left vacant by the user may be calculated automatically and displayed by the GUI as long as the vacant fields do not operate independently of populated parameter input fields and enough information can be gleaned from the populated fields to calculate the vacant field or fields. Throughout fields dependent upon on another are tied together by curved double tipped arrows.

The medication parameter input field may be the parameter input field in which a user sets the type of infusate agent to be infused. In the example embodiment the medication parameter input field has been populated and the infusate agent has been defined as 0.9 NORMAL SALINE . As shown after the specific infusate has been set the GUI may populate the medication parameter input field by displaying the name of the specific infusate in the medication parameter input field .

To set the specific infusate agent to be infused a user may touch the medication parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a list of different possible infusates. The user may browse through the list until the desired infusate is located. In other embodiments touching the in medication parameter input field may cull up a virtual keyboard. The user may then type the correct infusate on the virtual keyboard. In some embodiments the user may only need to type only a few letters of the infusate on the virtual keyboard before the GUI displays a number of suggestions. For example after typing NORE the GUI may suggest NOREPINEPHRINE . After locating the correct infusate the user may be required to perform an action such as but not limited to tapping double tapping or touching and dragging the infusate. After the required action has been completed by the user the infusate may be displayed by the GUI in the medication parameter input field . For another detailed description of another example means of infusate selection see .

In the example embodiment in the parameter input fields have been arranged by a user to perform a volume based infusion for instance mL mL hr etc. . Consequentially the in container drug amount parameter input field and total volume in container parameter input field have been left unpopulated. The concentration parameter input field and dose parameter input field have also been left unpopulated. In some embodiments the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container parameter input field concentration parameter input field and dose parameter input field may be locked grayed out or not displayed on the GUI when such an infusion has been selected. The in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container parameter input field concentration parameter input field and dose parameter input field will be further elaborated upon in subsequent paragraphs.

When the GUI is being used to program a volume base infusion the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field do not operate independent of one another. A user may only be required to define any two of the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field . The two parameters defined by a user may be the most convenient parameters for a user to set. The parameter left vacant by the user may be calculated automatically and displayed by the GUI . For instance if a user populates the rate parameter input field with a value of 125 mL hr as shown and populates the VTBI parameter input field with a value of 1000 mL as shown the time parameter input field value may be calculated by dividing the value in the VTBI parameter input field by the value in the rate parameter input field . In the example embodiment shown in the quotient of the above calculation 8 hrs and 0 min is correctly populated by the GUI into the time parameter input field .

For a user to populate the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field the user may touch or tap the desired parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a number pad with a range or number such as 0 9 displayed as individual selectable virtual buttons. A user may be required to input the parameter by individually tapping double tapping touching and dragging etc. the desired numbers. Once the desired value has been input by a user a user may be required to tap double tap etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to populate the field. For another detailed description of another example way of defining numerical values see .

The in container drug amount parameter input field is a two part field in the example embodiment shown in . In the example embodiment in the left field of the in container drug amount parameter input field is a field which may be populated with a numeric value. The numeric value may defined by the user in the same manner as a user may define values in the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field . In the example embodiment shown in the numeric value displayed by the GUI in the in left field of the in container drug amount parameter input field is 25 000 .

The parameter defined by the right field of the in container drug amount parameter input field is the unit of measure.

In some embodiments this may cull up a list of acceptable possible units of measure. In such embodiments the desired unit of measure may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In other embodiments touching the in container drug amount parameter input field may cull up a virtual keyboard. The user may then type the correct unit of measure on the virtual keyboard. In some embodiments the user may be required to tap double tap etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to populate the left field of the in container drug amount parameter input field .

The total volume in container parameter input field may be populated by a numeric value which defines the total volume of a container. In some embodiments the GUI may automatically populate the total volume in container parameter input field based on data generated by one or more sensors. In other embodiments the total volume in container parameter input field may be manually input by a user. The numeric value may defined by the user in the same manner as a user may define values in the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field . In the example embodiment shown in the total volume in container parameter input field has been populated with the value 250 mL. The total volume in container parameter input field may be restricted to a unit of measure such as mL as shown.

The concentration parameter input field is a two part field similar to the in container drug amount parameter input field . In the example embodiment in the left field of the concentration parameter input field is a field which may be populated with a numeric value. The numeric value may defined by the user in the same manner as a user may define values in the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field . In the example embodiment shown in the numeric value displayed by the GUI in the in left field of the concentration parameter input field is 100 .

The parameter defined by the right field of the concentration parameter input field is a unit of measure volume. To define the right field of the concentration parameter input field a user may touch the concentration parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a list of acceptable possible units of measure. In such embodiments the desired unit of measure may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In other embodiments touching the concentration parameter input field may cull up a virtual keyboard. The user may then type the correct unit of measure on the virtual keyboard. In some embodiments the user may be required to tap double tap etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to store the selection and move on to a list of acceptable volume measurements. The desired volume measurement may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In the example embodiment shown in the right field of the concentration parameter input field is populated with the unit of measure volume UNITS mL .

The in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container input field and concentration parameter input field are not independent of one another. As such a user may only be required to define any two of the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container input field and concentration parameter input field . For instance if a user were to populate the concentration parameter input field and the total volume in container parameter input field the in container drug amount parameter input field may be automatically calculated and populated on the GUI .

Since the GUI in is being programmed for a continuous volume time dose the dose rate parameter input field has been populated. The user may define the rate at which the infusate is infused by populating the dose rate parameter input field . In the example embodiment in the dose rate parameter input field is a two part field similar to the in container drug amount parameter input field and concentration parameter input field described above. A numeric value may defined in the left field of the dose rate parameter input field by the user in the same manner as a user may define values in the rate parameter input field . In the example embodiment in the left field of the dose rate parameter input field has been populated with the value 1000 .

The right field of the dose rate parameter input field may define a unit of measure time. To define the right field of the dose rate parameter input field a user may touch the dose rate parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a list of acceptable possible units of measure. In such embodiments the desired unit of measure may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In other embodiments touching the dose rate parameter input field may cull up a virtual keyboard. The user may then type the correct unit of measure on the virtual keyboard. In some embodiments the user may be required to tap double tap etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to store the selection and move on to a list of acceptable time measurements. The desired time measurement may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In the example embodiment shown in the right field of the dose rate parameter input field is populated with the unit of measure time UNITS hr .

In the example embodiment the dose rate parameter input field and the rate parameter input field are not independent of one another. After a user populates the dose rate parameter input field or the rate parameter input field the parameter input field left vacant by the user may be calculated automatically and displayed by the GUI as long as the concentration parameter input field has been defined. In the example embodiment shown in the rate parameter input field has been populated with an infusate flow rate of 10 mL hr . The dose rate parameter input field has been populated with 1000 UNITS hr .

In the example embodiment shown in the VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field have also been populated. The VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field may be populated by a user in the same manner described in relation to . When the GUI is being programmed to a continuous volume time dose rate infusion the VTBI parameter input field and the time parameter input field are dependent on one another. A user may only need to populate one of the VTBI parameter input field or the time parameter input field . The field left vacant by the user may be calculated automatically and displayed on the GUI .

As shown the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container input field and concentration parameter input field are laid out the same as in . In the example embodiment in the left field of the in container drug amount parameter input field has been populated with 1 . The right field of the in container drug amount parameter input field has been populated with g . Thus the total amount of Vancomycin in the container has been defined as one gram. The total volume in container parameter input field has been populated with 250 ml. The left field of the concentration parameter input field has been populated with 4.0 . The right field of the concentration parameter input field has been populated with mg mL .

As mentioned in relation to other possible types of infusions which a user may be capable of programming through the GUI the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container input field and concentration parameter input field are dependent upon each other. As above this is indicated by the curved double arrows connecting the parameter input field names. By populating any two of these parameters the third parameter may be automatically calculated and displayed on the correct parameter input field on the GUI .

In the example embodiment in the dose parameter input field has been populated. As shown the dose parameter input field comprises a right and left field. A numeric value may defined in the right field of the dose parameter input field by the user in the same manner as a user may define values for other parameter input fields which define numeric values. In the example embodiment in the left field of the dose parameter input field has been populated with the value 1000 .

The right field of the dose parameter input field may define a unit of mass measurement. To define the right field of the dose parameter input field a user may touch the dose parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a list of acceptable possible units of measure. In such embodiments the desired unit of measure may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In other embodiments touching the dose parameter input field may cull up a virtual keyboard. The user may then type the correct unit of measure on the virtual keyboard. In some embodiments the user may be required to tap double tap slide etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to store the selection and move on to a list of acceptable mass measurements. The desired mass measurement may be defined by a user in the same manner as a user may define the correct infusate. In the example embodiment shown in the right field of the dose parameter input field is populated with the unit of measurement mg .

As shown the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and the time parameter input field have been populated. As shown the rate parameter input field has been populated with 125 mL hr. The VTBI parameter input field has been defined as 250 mL. The time parameter input field has been defined as 2 hrs 00 min.

The user may not need to individually define each of the dose parameter input field rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and the time parameter input field . As indicated by the curved double arrows the dose parameter input field and the VTBI parameter input field are dependent upon each other. Input of one value may allow the other value to be automatically calculated and displayed by the GUI . The rate parameter input field and the time parameter input field are also dependent upon each other. The user may need to only define one value and then allow the non defined value to be automatically calculated and displayed on the GUI . In some embodiments the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and the time parameter input field may be locked on the GUI until the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container parameter input field and concentration parameter input field have been defined. These fields may be locked because automatic calculation of the rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and the time parameter input field is dependent upon values in the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container parameter input field and concentration parameter input field .

In scenarios where an infusate may require a body weight based dosage a weight parameter input field may also be displayed on the GUI . The example GUI shown on has been arranged such that a user may program a body weight based dosage. The parameter input fields may be defined by a user as detailed in the above discussion. In the example embodiment the infusate in the medication parameter input field has been defined as DOPAMINE . The left field of the in container drug amount parameter input field has been defined as 400 . The right field of the in container drug amount parameter input field has been defined as mg . The total volume in container parameter input field has been defined as 250 ml. The left field of the concentration parameter input field has been defined as 1.6 . The right field of the concentration parameter input field has been defined as mg mL . The weight parameter input field has been defined as 90 kg. The left field of the dose rater parameter input field has been defined as 5.0 . The right field of the dose rate parameter input field has been defined as mcg kg min . The rate parameter input field has been defined as 16.9 mL hr. The VTBI parameter input field has been defined as 250 mL. The time parameter input field has been defined as 14 hrs 48 min.

To define the weight parameter input field a user may touch or tap the weight parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a number pad with a range of numbers such as 0 9 displayed as individual selectable virtual buttons. A user may be required to input the parameter by individually tapping double tapping touching and dragging etc. the desired numbers. Once the desired value has been input by a user a user may be required to tap double tap etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to populate the field.

As indicated by the curved double arrows some parameter input fields displayed on the GUI may be dependent upon each other. As in previous examples the in container drug amount parameter input field total volume in container parameter input field and concentration parameter input field may be dependent upon each other. In the weight parameter input field dose rater parameter input field rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field and the time parameter input field are all dependent upon each other. When enough information has been defined by the user in these parameter input fields the parameter input fields not populated by the user may be automatically calculated and displayed on the GUI .

In some embodiments a user may be required to define a specific parameter input field even if enough information has been defined to automatically calculate the field. This may improve safety of use by presenting more opportunities for user input errors to be caught. If a value entered by a user is not compatible with already defined values the GUI may display an alert or alarm message soliciting the user to double check values that the user has entered.

In some scenarios the delivery of infusate may be informed by the body surface area BSA of a patient. In the GUI has been set up for a body surface area based infusion. As shown a BSA parameter input field may be displayed on the GUI . The parameter input fields may be defined by a user as detailed in the above discussion. In the example embodiment the infusate in the medication parameter input field has been defined as FLUOROURACIL . The left field of the in container drug amount parameter input field has been defined as 1700 . The right field of the in container drug amount parameter input field has been defined as mg . The total volume in container parameter input field has been defined as 500 ml. The left field of the concentration parameter input field has been defined as 3.4 . The right field of the concentration parameter input field has been defined as mg mL . The BSA parameter input field has been defined as 1.7 m. The left field of the dose rate parameter input field has been defined as 1000 . The right field of the dose rate parameter input field has been defined as mg m2 day . The rate parameter input field has been defined as 20.8 mL hr. The VTBI parameter input field has been defined as 500 mL. The time parameter input field has been defined as 24 hrs 00 min. The dependent parameter input fields are the same as in with the exception that the BSA parameter input field has taken the place of the weight parameter input field .

To populate the BSA parameter input field the user may touch or tap the BSA parameter input field on the GUI . In some embodiments this may cull up a number pad with a range of numbers such as 0 9 displayed as individual selectable virtual buttons. In some embodiments the number pad and any of the number pads detailed above may also feature symbols such as a decimal point. A user may be required to input the parameter by individually tapping double tapping touching and dragging etc. the desired numbers. Once the desired value has been input by a user a user may be required to tap double tap etc. a virtual confirm enter etc. button to populate the field.

In some embodiments a patient s BSA may be automatically calculated and displayed on the GUI . In such embodiments the GUI may query the user for information about the patient when a user touches taps etc. the BSA parameter input field . For example the user may be asked to define a patient s height and body weight. After the user defines these values they may be run through a suitable formula to find the patient s BSA. The calculated BSA may then be used to populate the BSA parameter input field on the GUI .

In operation the values displayed in the parameter input fields may change throughout the course of a programmed infusion to reflect the current state of the infusion. For example as the infusate is infused to a patient the values displayed by the GUI in the in container drug amount parameter input field and total volume in container parameter input field may decline to reflect the volume of the remaining contents of the container. Additionally the values in the VTBI parameter input field and time parameter input field may also decline as infusate is infused to the patient.

When the amount of infusate remaining reaches a pre determined threshold an INFUSION NEAR END ALERT may be triggered. The point at which INFUSION NEAR END ALERT is issued may be configured by the user. The INFUSION NEAR END ALERT may also be configured to be triggered sooner on short half life drugs. The INFUSION NEAR END ALERT may be in the form of a message on the GUI and may be accompanied by flashing lights and audible noises such as a series of beeps. The INFUSION NEAR END ALERT allows time for the care giver and pharmacy to prepare materials to continue the infusion if necessary. As shown the infusion rate may not change over the INFUSION NEAR END ALERT TIME .

When the syringe pump see has infused the VTBI to a patient a VTBI ZERO ALERT may be triggered. The VTBI ZERO ALERT may be in the form of a message on the GUI and may be accompanied by flashing lights and audible noises such as beeps. As shown the VTBI ZERO ALERT causes the pump to switch to a keep vein open hereafter KVO rate until a new infusate container may be put in place. The KVO rate is a low infusion rate for example 5 25 mL hr . The rate is set to keep the infusion site patent until a new infusion may be started. The KVO rate may be configurable by the group elaborated upon later or medication and can be modified on the syringe pump . The KVO rate is not allowed to exceed the continuous infusion rate. When the KVO rate can no longer be sustained and the syringe has reached the end of its stoke an END OF STROKE ALARM may be triggered. When the END OF STROKE ALARM is triggered all infusion may stop. The END OF STROKE ALARM may be in the form of a message on the GUI and may be accompanied by flashing lights and audible noises such as beeps.

The syringe pump see may also be used to deliver a primary or secondary intermittent infusion. During an intermittent infusion an amount of a drug dose is administered to a patient as opposed to a continuous infusion where the drug is given at a specified dose rate amount time . An intermittent infusion is also delivered over a defined period of time however the time period and dose are independent of one another. The previously described shows a setup of the GUI for a continuous infusion. The previously described shows a setup of the GUI for an intermittent infusion.

Depending on the group further elaborated upon later or the medication it may be desirable to configure the syringe pump to behave differently at the end of an intermittent infusion. Other configurations may cause a syringe pump see to behave differently. For example in scenarios where the intermittent infusion is a secondary infusion the pump see may be configured to automatically switch back to the primary infusion after issuing a notification that the secondary intermittent infusion has been completed. In alternate configurations the a syringe pump may be configured issue a VTBI ZERO ALERT and drop the infusion rate to a KVO rate after completing the intermittent infusion. In such configurations the user may be required to manually clear the alert before a primary infusion is resumed.

A bolus may also be delivered as a primary intermittent infusion when it may be necessary or desirable to achieve a higher blood plasma drug concentration or manifest a more immediate therapeutic effect. In such cases the bolus may be delivered by a pump see executing the primary infusion. The bolus may be delivered from the same container which the primary infusion is being delivered from. A bolus may be performed at any point during an infusion providing there is enough infusate to deliver the bolus. Any volume delivered via a bolus to a patient is included in the value displayed by the VTBI parameter input field of the primary infusion.

Depending on the infusate a user may be forbidden from performing a bolus. The dosage of a bolus may be pre set depending on the specific infusate or infusate concentration being used. Additionally the period of time over which the bolus occurs may be pre defined depending on the infusate being used. After performing a bolus the bolus function may be locked for a pre defined period of time. In some embodiments a user may be capable of adjusting these pre sets by adjusting various setting on the GUI . In some situations such as those where the drug being infused has a long half life vancomycin teicoplanin etc. a bolus may be given as a loading dose to more quickly reach a therapeutically effective blood plasma drug concentration.

The INFUSION NEAR END ALERT is triggered during the fourth step of the example infusion shown in . At the end of the fifth and final step of the multi step infusion the VTBI ZERO ALERT is triggered. In the example configuration shown in the graph in the rate is dropped to a KVO rate after the multi step infusion has been concluded and the VTBI ZERO ALERT has been issued. Other configurations may differ.

Each rate change in a multi step infusion may be handled in a variety of different ways. In some configurations the syringe pump see may display a notification and automatically adjust the rate to move on to the next step. In other configurations the syringe pump may issue an alert before changing the rate and wait for confirmation from the user before adjusting the rate and moving on to the next step. In such configurations the pump may stop the infusion or drop to a KVO rate until user confirmation has been received.

In some embodiments the user may be capable of pre programming infusions. The user may pre program an infusion to automatically being after a fixed interval of time has elapsed e.g. 2 hours . The infusion may also be programmed to automatically being at a specific time of day e.g. 12 30 pm . In some embodiments the user may be capable of programming the syringe pump see to alert the user with a callback function when it is time to being the pre programmed infusion. The user may need to confirm the start of the pre programmed infusion. The callback function may be a series of audible beeps flashing lights or the like.

In arrangements where there is more than one pump see the user may be able to program a relay infusion. The relay infusion may be programmed such that after a first pump has completed its infusion a second pump may automatically being a second infusion and so on. The user may also program a relay infusion such that the user is alerted via the callback function before the relay occurs. In such a programmed arrangement the relay infusion may not being until confirmation from a user has been received. A pump may continue at a KVO rate until user confirmation has been received.

In the Drug Administration Library has two boxes which are associated with the names Group Settings ICU and Group Settings . These boxes form the headings for their own columns. These boxes may be used to define a group in within a facility e.g. pediatric intensive care unit emergency room sub acute care etc. in which the device is stationed. Groups may also be areas outside a parent facility for example a patient s home or an inter hospital transport such as an ambulance. Each group may be used to set specific settings for various groups within a facility weight titration limits etc. . These groups may alternatively be defined in other manners. For example the groups may be defined by user training level. The group may be defined by a prior designated individual or any of a number of prior designated individuals and changed if the associated patient or device is moved from one specific group within a facility to another.

In the example embodiment the left column is Group Settings ICU which indicates that the syringe pump see is stationed in the intensive care unit of the facility. The right column is Group Settings and has not been further defined. In some embodiments this column may be used to designate a sub group for example operator training level. As indicated by lines extending to the box off to the left of the block diagram from the Group settings ICU and Group Settings columns the settings for these groups may include a preset number of default settings.

The group settings may include limits on patient weight limits on patient BSA air alarm sensitivity occlusion sensitivity default KVO rates VTBI limits etc. The group settings may also include parameters such as whether or not a review of a programmed infusion is necessary for high risk infusates whether the user must identify themselves before initiating an infusion whether the user must enter a text comment after a limit has been overridden etc. A user may also define the defaults for various attributes like screen brightness or speaker volume. In some embodiments a user may be capable of programming the screen to automatically adjust screen brightness in relation to one or more conditions such as but not limited to time of day.

As also shown to the left of the block diagram in each facility may have a Master Medication List defining all of the infusates which may be used in the facility. The Master Medication List may comprise a number of medications which a qualified individual may update or maintain. In the example embodiment the Master Medication List only has three medications Heparin 0.9 Normal Saline and Alteplase. Each group within a facility may have its own list of medications used in the group. In the example embodiment the Group Medication List ICU only includes a single medication Heparin.

As shown each medication may be associated with one or a number of clinical uses. In the Clinical Use Records are defined for each medication in a group medication list and appear as an expanded sub heading for each infusate. The clinical uses may be used to tailor limits and pre defined settings for each clinical use of the infusate. For Heparin weight based dosing and non weight based dosing are shown in as possible clinical uses. In some embodiments there may be a Clinical Use Record setting requiring the user to review or re enter a patient s weight or BSA before beginning an infusion.

Clinical uses may also be defined for the different medical uses of each infusate e.g. stroke heart attack etc. instead of or in addition to the infusate s dose mode. The clinical use may also be used to define whether the infusate is given as a primary continuous infusion primary intermittent infusion secondary infusion etc. They may also be use to provide appropriate limits on the dose rate VTBI time duration etc. Clinical uses may also provide titration change limits the availability of boluses the availability of loading doses and many other infusion specific parameters. In some embodiments it may be necessary to provide at least one clinical use for each infusate in the group medication list.

Each clinical use may additionally comprise another expanded sub heading in which the concentration may also be defined. In some cases there may be more than one possible concentration of an infusate. In the example embodiment in the weight base dosing clinical use has a 400 mg 250 mL concentration and an 800 mg 250 mL concentration. The non weight based dosing clinical use only has one concentration 400 mg mL. The concentrations may also be used to define an acceptable range for instances where the user may customize the concentration of the infusate. The concentration setting may include information on the drug concentration as shown the diluents volume or other related information.

In some embodiments the user may navigate to the Drug Administration Library to populate some of the parameter input fields shown in . The user may also navigate to the Drug Administration Library to choose from the clinical uses for each infusate what type of infusion the syringe pump see will administer. For example if a user were to select weight based Heparin dosing on the GUI might display the infusion programming screen shown on with Heparin populated into the medication parameter input field . Selecting a clinical use of a drug may also prompt a user to select a drug concentration. This concentration may then be used to populate the concentration parameter input field see . In some embodiments the Drug Administration Library may be updated and maintained external to the syringe pump and communicated to the syringe pump via any suitable means. In such embodiments the Drug Administration Library may not be changeable on the syringe pump but may only place limits and or constraints on programming options for a user populating the parameter input fields shown in .

As mentioned above by choosing a medication and clinical use from the group medication list a user may also be setting limits on other parameter input fields for infusion programming screens. For example by defining a medication in the Drug Administration Library a user may also be defining limits for the dose parameter input field dose rate parameter input field rate parameter input field VTBI parameter input field time parameter input field etc. These limits may be pre defined for each clinical use of an infusate prior to the programming of an infusion by a user. In some embodiments limits may have both a soft limit and a hard limit with the hard limit being the ceiling for the soft limit. In some embodiments the group settings may include limits for all of the medications available to the group. In such cases clinical use limits may be defined to further tailor the group limits for each clinical usage of a particular medication.

The software architecture of the syringe pump is shown schematically in . The software architecture divides the software into cooperating subsystems that interact to carry out the required pumping action. The software is equally applicable to all the embodiments described herein. It is also possible to apply the software to other pumps not described herein. Each subsystem may be composed of one or more execution streams controlled by the underlying operating system. Useful terms used in the art include operating system subsystem process thread and task.

Asynchronous messages are used to push information to the destination task or process. The sender process or task does not get confirmation of message delivery. Data delivered in this manner is typically repetitive in nature. If messages are expected on a consistent schedule the receiver process or task can detect a failure if a message does not arrive on time.

Synchronous messages may be used to send a command to a task or process or to request pull information from a process or task. After sending the command or request the originating task or process suspends execution while awaiting a response. The response may contain the requested information or may acknowledge the receipt of the sent message. If a response is not received in a timely manner the sending process or task may time out. In such an event the sending process or task may resume execution and or may signal a error condition.

An operating system OS is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system may act as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware. Although some application code may be executed directly by the hardware the application code may frequently make a system call to an OS function or be interrupted by it.

The RTP may run on a Real Time Operating System RTOS that has been certified to a safety level for medical devices. An RTOS is a multitasking operating system that aims at executing real time applications. Real time operating systems often use specialized scheduling algorithms so that they can achieve a deterministic nature of behavior. The UIP may run on a Linux operating system. The Linux operating system is a Unix like computer operating system.

A subsystem is a collection of software and perhaps hardware assigned a specific set of related system functionality or functionalities. A subsystem has clearly defined responsibilities and a clearly defined interface to other subsystems. A subsystem is an architectural division of the software that uses one or more processes threads or tasks.

A process is an independent executable running on a Linux operating system which runs in its own virtual address space. The memory management hardware on the CPU is used to enforce the integrity and isolation of this memory by write protecting code space and disallowing data access outside of the process memory region. Processes can only pass data to other processes using inter process communication facilities.

In Linux a thread is a separately scheduled concurrent path of program execution. On Linux a thread is always associated with a process which must have at least one thread and can have multiple threads . Threads share the same memory space as its parent process. Data can be directly shared among all of the threads belonging to a process but care must be taken to properly synchronize access to shared items. Each thread has an assigned execution priority.

A Task on an RTOS Real Time Operating System is a separately scheduled concurrent path of program execution analogous to a Linux thread . All tasks share the same memory address space which consists of the entire CPU memory map. When using an RTOS that provides memory protection each task s effective memory map is restricted by the Memory Protection Unit MPU hardware to the common code space and the task s private data and stack space.

The processes on the UIP communicate via IPC calls as shown by the one way arrows in . Each solid lined arrow represents a synchronous message call and response and dotted line arrows are asynchronous messages . The tasks on the RTP similarly communicate with each other. The RTP and UIP may be bridged by an asynchronous serial line with one of an InterComm Process or InterComm Task on each side. The InterComm Process presents the same communications API Application Programming Interface on both sides of the bridge so all processes and tasks can use the same method calls to interact.

The Executive Process may invoked by the Linux system startup scripts after all of the operating system services have started. The Executive Process then starts the various executable files that comprise the software on the UIP . If any of the software components should exit or fail unexpectedly the Executive Process may be notified and may generate the appropriate alarm.

While the system is running the Executive Process may act as a software watchdog for various system components. After registering with the Executive Process a process is required to check in or send a signal periodically to the Executive Process . Failure to check in at the required interval may be detected by the Executive Process . Upon detection of a failed subsystem the Executive Process may take remedial action of either do nothing declaring an alarm or restarting the failed process. The remedial action taken is predetermined by a table entry compiled into the Executive Process . The check in interval may vary from process to process. The amount of variance between check in times for different processes may be based in part on the importance of the process. The check in interval may also vary during syringe pump operation to optimize the pump controller response by minimizing computer processes. In one example embodiment during syringe loading the pump controller may check in less frequently than during active pumping.

In response to the required check in message the Executive Process may return various system status items to processes that checked in. The system status items may be the status of one or more components on the syringe pump and or errors. The System Status items may include battery status WiFi connection status device gateway connection status device status Idle Infusion Running Diagnostic Mode Error Etc. technical error indications and engineering log levels.

A thread running in the Executive Process may be used to read the state of the battery from an internal monitor chip in the battery . This may be done at a relatively infrequent interval such as every 10 seconds.

The UI View implements the graphical user interface GUI see rendering the display graphics on the display and responding to inputs on the touch screen in embodiments comprising a touch screen or to inputs communicated via other data input means . The UI View design is stateless. The graphic being displayed may be commanded by the UI Model Process along with any variable data to be displayed. The commanded graphic may be refreshed periodically regardless of data changes.

The style and appearance of user input dialogs Virtual keyboard drop down selection list check box etc. may be specified by the screen design and implemented entirely by the UI View . User input may be collected by the UI View and sent to the UI Model for interpretation. The UI View may provide for multi region multi lingual support with facilities for the following list including but not limited to virtual keyboards unicode strings loadable fonts right to left entry translation facility loadable translation files and configurable numbers and date formats.

The UI Model implements the screen flows and so controls the user experience. The US Model interacts with the UI View specifying the screen to display and supplies any transient values to be displayed on the screen. Here screen refers the image displayed on the physical display and the defined interactive areas or user dialogs i.e. buttons sliders keypads etc on the touch screen . The UI Model interprets any user inputs sent from the UI View and may either update the values on the current screen command a new screen or pass the request to the appropriate system service i.e. start pumping is passed to the RTP .

When selecting a medication to infuse from the Drug Administration Library the UI Model interacts with the Drug Administration Library stored in the local data base which is part of the Database System . The user s selections setup the run time configurations for programming and administering the desired medication.

While the operator is entering an infusion program The UI Model may relay the user s input values to the Infusion Manager for validation and interpretation. Therapeutic decisions may not be made by the UI Model . The treatment values may be passed from the Infusion Manager to the UI Model to the UI View to be displayed for the user.

The UI Model may continuously monitor the device status gathered from the Infusion Manager current infusion progress alerts etc. for possible display by the UI View . Alerts Alarms and other changes in system state may provoke a screen change by the UI Model .

The Infusion Manager Process IM may validate and controls the infusion delivered by the syringe pump . To start an infusion the user may interact with the UI View Model to select a specific medication and clinical use. This specification selects one specific Drug Administration Library DAL entry for use. The IM loads this DAL entry from the database for use in validating and running the infusion.

Once a Drug Administration Library entry is selected the IM may pass the dose mode limits for all user enterable parameters and the default values if set up to the UI Model . Using this data the UI Model may guide the user in entering the infusion program.

As each parameter is entered by the user the value may sent from the UI View Model to the IM for verification. The IM echoes the parameters back to the UI View Model along with an indication of the parameter s conformance to the DAL limits. This allows the UI View Model to notify the user of any values that are out of bounds.

When a complete set of valid parameters has been entered the IM also may return a valid infusion indicator allowing the UI View Model to present a Start control to the user.

The IM may simultaneously make the infusion pump status available to the UI View Model upon request. If the UI View Model is displaying a status screen it may request this data to populate it. The data may be a composite of the infusion state and the pump state.

When requested to run the valid infusion the IM may pass the Infusion Worksheet containing user specified data and the Infusion Template containing the read only limits from the DAL as a CRC d binary block to the Infusion Control Task running on the RTP . The Infusion Control Task on the RTP takes the same user inputs conversions and DERS inputs and recalculates the Infusion Worksheet. The Infusion Control Task calculated results may be stored in a second CRC d binary block and compared to the first binary block from the UIP . The infusion calculations performed on the UIP may be recalculated and double checked on the RTP before the infusion is run.

Coefficients to convert the input values ie. 1 grams etc. to a standard unit such as ml may be stored in the UIP memory or database system . The coefficients may be stored in a lookup table or at specific memory locations. The lookup table may contain 10 s of conversion values. In order to reduce the chance that flipping a single bit will resulting in the wrong conversion factor being used the addresses for the conversion values may be distributed among the values from zero to 4294967296 or 2. The addresses may be selected so that the binary form of one address is never just one bit different from a second address.

While an infusion is running the IM may monitor its progress sequences pauses restarts secondary infusions boluses and KVO keep vein open scenarios as needed. Any user alerts requested during the infusion Infusion near complete KVO callback Secondary complete callback etc may be tracked and triggered by the IM .

Processes on the UIP may communicate with each other via a proprietary messaging scheme based on a message queue library that is available with Linux. The system provides for both acknowledged synchronous message and unacknowledged asynchronous message message passing.

Messages destined for the Real time Processor RTP may be passed to the InterComm Process which forwards the messages to the RTP over a serial link . A similar InterComm Task on the RTP may relay the message to its intended destination via the RTP messaging system.

The messaging scheme used on this serial link may provide for error detection and retransmission of flawed messages. This may be needed to allow the system to be less susceptible to electrical disturbances that may occasionally garble inter processor communications.

To maintain a consistent interface across all tasks the message payloads used with the messaging system may be data classes derived from a common baseclass MessageBase . This class adds both data identity message type and data integrity CRC to messages.

The Audio Server Process may be used to render sounds on the system. All user feedback sounds key press beeps and alarm or alert tones may be produced by playing pre recorded sound files. The sound system may also be used to play music or speech if desired.

Sound requests may be symbolic such as Play High Priority Alarm Sound with the actual sound file selection built into the Audio Server process . The ability to switch to an alternative soundscape may be provided. This ability may be used to customize the sounds for regional or linguistic differences.

The Device Gateway Communication Manager Process DGCM may manage communications with the Device Gateway Server over a Wi Fi network . The DGCM may be started and monitored by the Executive Process . If the DGCM exits unexpectedly it may be restarted by the Executive Process but if the failures are persistent the system may continue to function without the gateway running.

It may be the function of the DGCM to establish and maintain the Wi Fi connection and to then establish a connection to the Device Gateway. All interactions between the DGCM and the Device Gateway use a system such as the system described in the cross referenced nonprovisional application Ser. No. 13 723 253 for System Method and Apparatus for Electronic Patient Care.

If the connection to the gateway is unavailable or becomes unavailable the DGCM may discontinue any transfers in progress and attempt to reconnect the link. Transfers may be resumed when the link is reestablished. Network and Gateway operational states are reported periodically to the Executive Process . The Executive Process distributes this information for display to the user.

The DGCM may function as an autonomous subsystem polling the Device Gateway Server for updates and downloading newer items when available. In addition the DGCM may monitor the logging tables in the database uploading new log events as soon as they are available. Events that are successfully uploaded may be flagged as such in the database. After a reconnection to the Device Gateway Server the DGCM may catch up with the log uploads sending all items that were entered during the communications disruption. Firmware and Drug Administration Library updates received from the Gateway may be staged in the UIP s file system for subsequent installation. Infusion programs clinical advisories patient identification and other data items destined for the device may be staged in the database.

The DGCM may report connection status and date time updates to the Executive Process . There may not be other direct connections between the DGCM and any of the other operational software. Such a design decouples the operational software from the potentially transient availability of the Device Gateway and Wi Fi network.

The Motor Check software may read a hardware counter or encoder that reports motor rotation. The software in this module may independently estimate the motor s movements and compare them to the expected motion based on the user inputs for rate of infusion. This may be an independent check for proper motor control. However the primary motor control software may executed on the RTP .

Event information may be written to a log via the Logging Process during normal operation. These events may consist of internal machine status and measurements as well as therapy history events. Due to the volume and frequency of event log data these logging operations may be buffered in a FIFO queue while waiting to be written to the database.

A SQL database PostgreSQL may be used to store the Drug Administration Library Local Machine Settings Infusion History and Machine Log data. Stored procedures executed by the database server may be used to insulate the application from the internal database structures.

The database system may be used as a buffer for log data destined for the Device Gateway server as well as a staging area for infusion settings and warnings sent to the pump from the Gateway.

Upon requesting the start of an infusion the DAL entry and all user selected parameters may be sent to the Infusion Control Task . All of the DAL validations and a recalculation of the infusion rate and volume based upon the requested dose may be performed. The result may be checked against the results calculated by the IM on the UIP . These results may be required to match to continue.

When running an infusion the Infusion Control Task may control the delivery of each infusion segment i.e. one part of an infusion consisting of a volume and a rate. Examples of segments are a primary infusion KVO bolus remainder of primary after bolus primary after titration etc. The infusion segments are sequenced by the IM Process on the UIP .

The Pump Control Task may incorporate the controllers that drive the pumping mechanism. The desired pumping rate and amount VTBI may be specified in commands sent from the Infusion Control Task .

The Pump Control may receive periodic sensor readings from the Sensor Task . The new sensor readings may be used to determine the motor speed and position and to calculate the desired command to send to the Brushless Motor Control IRQ . The receipt of the sensor message may trigger a recalculation of the controller output.

While pumping fluid the Pump Control Task may perform at least one of the following tasks controlling pumping speed measuring volume delivered measuring air detected over a rolling time window measuring fluid pressure or other indications of occlusions and detecting upstream occlusions.

Relevant measurements may be reported to the RTP Status Task periodically. The Pump Control may execute one infusion segment at a time stopping when the commanded delivery volume has been reached. The Sensor Task may read and aggregate the sensor data used for the dynamic control of the pumping system.

The sensor task may be scheduled to run at a consistent 1 kHz rate every 1.0 ms via a dedicated counter timer. After all of the relevant sensors are read the data may be passed to the Pump Control Task via an asynchronous message . The periodic receipt of this message may be used as the master time base to synchronize the syringe pump s control loops.

The RTP Status Task may be the central repository for both the state and the status of the various tasks running on the RTP . The RTP Status Task may distribute this information to both the IM running on the UIP as well as to tasks on the RTP itself.

The RTP Status Task may also be charged with fluid accounting for the ongoing infusion. Pump starts and stops as well as pumping progress may be reported to RTP Status by the Pump Control Task . The RTP Status Task may account for at least one of the following total volume infused primary volume delivered primary VTBI counted down volume delivered and VTBI of a bolus while the bolus is in progress and volume delivered and VTBI of a secondary infusion while the secondary infusion is in progress.

All alerts or alarms originating on the RTP may be funneled through the RTP Status Task and subsequently passed up to the UIP .

While the unit is in operation the program flash and RAM memory may be continually tested by the Memory Checker Task . This test may be non destructive. This test may be scheduled so that the entire memory space on the RTP is tested every few hours. Additional periodic checks may be scheduled under this task if needed.

Tasks running on the RTP may be required to communicate with each other as well as to tasks that are executing on the UIP .

The RTP messaging system may use a unified global addressing scheme to allow messages to be passed to any task in the system. Local messages may be passed in memory utilizing the facilities of the RTOS message passing with off chip messages routed over the asynchronous serial link by the InterComm Task .

The InterComm Task may manage the RTP side of the serial link between the two processors. The InterComm Task is the RTP equivalent of the InterComm Process on the UIP . Messages received from the UIP may be relayed to their destination on the RTP . Outbound messages may be forwarded to InterComm Process on the UIP .

All messages between the RTP and the UIP may be checked for data corruption using an error detecting code 32 bit CRC . Messages sent over the serial link may be re sent if corruption is detected. This provides a communications system that is reasonably tolerant to ESD. Corrupted messages within the processor between processes may be handled as a hard system failure. All of the message payloads used with the messaging system may be data classes derived from a common baseclass MessageBase to assure consistency across all possible message destinations.

Brushless Motor Control IRQ may not run as a task it may be implemented as a strict foreground interrupt context process. Interrupts are generated from the commutator or hall sensors and the commutation algorithm may be run entirely in the interrupt service routine.
