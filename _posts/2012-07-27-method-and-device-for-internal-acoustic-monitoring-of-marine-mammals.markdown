The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention is generally directed towards a system and method for monitoring the behavior and activities of a marine mammal in an ocean or other body of water. More specifically the invention is directed towards measuring differences in sounds temperatures and pressures detected within a marine mammal then analyzing the data to better understand the activities and behavior of the marine mammal.

Many efforts to study marine mammals response to active sonar have involved tagging the mammals with devices to record the local acoustic field and the depth. However the tagging operation itself is difficult to do. In a conventional approach the researchers typically apply a tag externally via a rod to the mammal from a boat. Often only a handful of animals are tagged for a given study.

Capsule endoscopy has been used to record images of the digestive tract of a person in medicine. The capsule is the size and shape of a pill and contains a tiny camera. After a patient swallows the capsule it takes pictures of the inside of the gastrointestinal tract. The primary use of capsule endoscopy is to examine areas of the small intestine that cannot be seen by other types of endoscopy such as colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD .

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and device for monitoring the behavior and activities of a marine mammal in an ocean or other body of water.

The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in view of the following description claims and drawings.

A method for monitoring behavior and activity of a marine mammal in a body of water includes the steps of disposing into the body of water a buoyant capsule having a hydrophone a temperature sensor a pressure sensor a memory chip a radio frequency RF generator software and a battery enclosed within a shell inducing the marine mammal to ingest the capsule detecting temperature changes of the capsule by the temperature sensor activating the capsule when an internal body temperature of the marine mammal is detected detecting sound data via the hydrophone including sonar transmitted by a monitoring ship and detecting pressure data via the pressure sensor then saving the sound and pressure data on the memory chip after excretion by the marine mammal detecting a water temperature of the body of water to trigger transmission of an RF signal from the excreted capsule allowing the capsule to be recovered on the surface of the body of water and retrieving the sound pressure and temperature data from the recovered capsule.

A capsule device for monitoring behavior and activity of a marine mammal in a body of water includes electronic components enclosed within a waterproof shell. The capsule is designed to be buoyant in water. The shell is made of material which is harmless to the mammals and will not dissolve in the mammal s digestive track. The capsule includes a temperature sensor an RF generator a hydrophone a battery power source a pressure sensor and a memory chip.

This invention provides an efficient monitoring device and process for marine mammals where the mammals are given a pill or capsule see that is put into food to encourage the mammal to swallow it. The capsule includes electronics for measuring and recording sounds temperatures and pressures within the mammal.

An ocean vessel or ship acts as a base for the monitoring operations. The vessel is capable of transmitting sonar disposing the capsules into the ocean and retrieving capsules from the ocean. In step of the vessel disposes one or more buoyant capsules into the ocean or other body of water where the marine mammals reside and as indicated in step the mammals are induced to swallow the capsules since they are mixed together with food.

The capsule temperature is constantly monitored by a temperature sensor in steps and . While in the water heat transfer from the water will cause the temperature of the capsule to approach that of the water. After the capsule is ingested by the marine mammal the capsule temperature will rise to a first threshold of the internal body temperature of the mammal thus activating the capsule in step . When the capsule is activated the temperature sensor a pressure sensor a hydrophone and a memory chip with its associated software all become activated.

The hydrophone determines in step the intensity and presence of sonar and other sound waves within the mammal. For example sonar transmitted by the monitoring vessel can be measured for intensity within the mammal.

The pressure sensor monitors changes in pressure directly related to the depth of the mammal in the ocean in step . Thus the dive patterns of the marine mammal can be determined.

Within a matter of hours the capsule will work its way through the mammal s digestive system and eventually be excreted whereby its buoyancy will cause the capsule to rise to the ocean s surface. Once the capsule is excreted its temperature will decrease from the mammal s internal temperature and approach the water temperature. When the second threshold T is met in steps and indicating that the capsule has been excreted back into the water the RF generator within the capsule will transmit an RF signal which is received by the receiver on the nearby monitoring ship so that the capsule can be recovered in step . Note that there are other potential means to detect the capsule as well. For example the capsule could release oil when it reaches the water surface that could be detected. The oil has the added advantages of not requiring any additional energy for detection and adding to the buoyancy of the overall capsule design.

After recovery data within the memory of the capsule is retrieved for instance via wireless communication or by any other known means for communications transfer. The data includes temperature pressure and acoustic data. Examination of the data provides detailed information about the behavior and activities of the marine mammal. For example the behavior and sounds emitted by the mammal may be analyzed by marine biologists to reveal potential indications of serenity or distress.

The hydrophone is an electrical instrument for detecting or monitoring sound underwater including an electro acoustic transducer that converts sound traveling through water into electrical oscillations. The hydrophone can pick up sounds in the water from the monitoring vessel and those produced by the marine mammal that are indicative of the behavior well being and travels of the mammal.

The pressure sensor measures pressure differences as the mammal dives to different depths in the ocean. The diving patterns of the mammal can also be indicative of the behavior well being and travels of the mammal.

The temperature sensor is constantly measuring the temperature of the capsule . The average temperature of the ocean surface is 17 degrees C. In contrast most marine mammals have an internal body temperature in the range of thirty four to forty degrees C. Thus after a capsule is ingested by a marine mammal the temperature sensor will detect the change T in temperature and when the temperature reaches a first threshold T within the internal body temperature range of the mammal then the capsule will be activated.

Once the capsule is activated the hydrophone pressure sensor memory chip and its associated software will all become operational to allow the measurement and recording of local acoustic fields pressures and depths.

This device in a modified form can also be useful to law enforcement agencies as an alternative to externally mounted microphone devices which can be detected much more easily . Having someone swallow a hydrophone capsule would allow recording of their conversation with another nearby person although perhaps not to the same fidelity as a concealed microphone . However it would have the advantage that it would be almost undetectable. Such a device will be much simpler than those used for marine mammal monitoring it does not need to monitor depth and it does not have to be neutrally buoyant.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
