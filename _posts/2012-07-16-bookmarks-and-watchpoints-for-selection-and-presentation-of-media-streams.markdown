title: Bookmarks and watchpoints for selection and presentation of media streams
abstract: Selection and presentation of media streams, in which presentation is not limited by order imposed by the digital content representative of those media streams, in response to bookmarks and watchpoints settable and usable by a user. Bookmarks reference a location within the media stream, not necessarily pre-selected and possibly dynamically selected, in which a presentation can be started or restarted therefrom. Watchpoints reference a location within the media stream, or a presentation state for the media stream, in which an action can be triggered thereby. Bookmarks and watchpoints provide a general technique for presenting selections from media streams in response to metadata.

The invention relates to selection and presentation of media streams in aspects thereof the invention relates to bookmarks and watchpoints and to event handling for selection and display of videos from media such as for example DVD and other related media.

In systems for presenting information such as for example information relating to audiovisual media users are able to present information already recorded on digital media. For example DVD player systems provide users with the ability to playback digital content pre recorded on DVD media. In the incorporated disclosure as described below such systems provide users with the ability to present that is display video elements of and play audio elements of media streams either after or concurrently with download of digital content representing those media streams. In the incorporated disclosure as described below such systems further provide the capability of downloading that digital content from one or more content servers.

A first problem with known DVD media playback is that the process of playback involves interaction between the user and a pre selected sequence of playback capabilities recorded onto the DVD media by someone other than the user such as a creator or distributor of that DVD media . For example playback might involve navigation of a selection menu might involve playback of audiovisual messages the creator or distributor has determined are advantageous for the user to be forced to watch such as for example an anti piracy warning or such as for example one or more advertisements or pre release announcements . Accordingly it would at some times be advantageous to avoid being restricted by choices imposed on them by the creator or distributor of the DVD media.

A second problem with known playback techniques is that the user might have a substantial library of media streams from which the user might desire to present. For a first example the user might wish to present short clips or trailers of individual movies as part of a process of selection or review of those individual movies. For example the user might wish to present a trailer for an individual movie as part of deciding whether to purchase that movie including for example on line purchase of a downloaded copy or to present that movie to a selected audience including for example determining if that audience was interested in the movie in response to the selected trailer . For a second example the user might wish to point to selections from media streams when analyzing commenting on reviewing or selecting portions thereof. A first example thereof might be a biography of a known actor or director including selections of short clips of scenes used for illustrative scholarly literary artistic political or social purposes. A second example thereof might be that the user wishes to present a short clip such as a favorite scene for presentation to a selected audience including for example just the user themselves or as part of a pedagogical exercise including for example as a demonstration of acting technique or camera work .

Both these problems are exacerbated by increases in the number of DVD media providers whether creators or distributors and by increases in the number of media streams available to the user. Moreover both these problems might inhibit development of a convenient UI user interface for selection and presentation of media streams whether from recorded physical media or downloaded from one or more content servers.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide an improved technique for video selection and presentation relatively less subject to problems with known techniques.

The invention provides a method and system capable of selection and presentation of media streams in which presentation is not substantially limited by any order imposed by the digital content representative of those media streams.

In one aspect the invention provides a method and system capable of creating and referencing a bookmark to a location selected within the media stream not necessarily pre selected by the creator or distributor of that media stream and possibly dynamically selected by a recipient of digital content representing that media stream.

In addition to referencing the bookmark the invention provides a user with the capability of starting or restarting presentation from the selected bookmark.

In one aspect the invention provides a method and system capable of creating a watchpoint at a location selected within the media stream or a presentation state otherwise associated with presentation of the media stream capable of associating with that watchpoint one or more watchpoint triggers indicating on what conditions the watchpoint is triggered and one or more watchpoint actions indicating what actions are taken in response to triggering the watchpoint . For one example the user might designate a bookmark at the beginning of a selected film clip a watchpoint trigger with the end of that same film clip and a watchpoint action associated with the watchpoint which watchpoint action directs a presentation device to return to a presentation state it was at before presenting from the bookmark. In this example the film clip effectively acts as a media element capable of being inserted into another different media stream or more generally into any other user interface or media presentation the original user interface or media presentation not necessarily including any original media streams of its own without involving any other digital content associated with the larger media stream that contains that film clip.

In one aspect the invention provides a method and system capable of selecting one of a set of such film clips bookmark watchpoint pairs for presentation in response to a user input a user preference a playback device configuration demographic information about the user or the playback device or other pertinent information. For a first example a one or more DVD s might have a first version of its movie better suited for presentation on a regular television screen and a second version of its movie better suited for presentation on a widescreen or HDTV television screen currently the movie Shrek is sometimes marketed with two separate DVD s one of which includes a widescreen version and one of which includes a narrowscreen version . For a second example one or more DVD s might have a first version of its movie better suited for presentation to a mature audience and a second version of its movie better suited for presentation to a less mature audience. For a third example a single DVD might have a set of versions of its movie with selected different plot points or movie endings for those different audiences or users who prefer the movie to have a happy ending or otherwise. For a fourth example a single DVD might have a shorter abridged and a longer unabridged version of the same movie selectable by the user.

In one aspect the invention provides a method and system capable of selecting one of a set of such film skips watchpoint bookmark pairs with the effect that a section of a media stream might be skipped censored or otherwise edited out in response to a user input a user preference a playback device configuration demographic information about the user or the playback device or other pertinent information.

In one aspect the invention provides a method and system capable of testing one or more state variables at such bookmarks or watchpoints and of taking different actions in response to distinct values of those state variables. In one embodiment the invention provides a user with the capability of designing a sequence of actions conditional or unconditional by which selections from media streams might be presented in response to digital content representing those media streams and in response to other information. Such other information might include the scope of a license afforded to the user demographic or other metadata about that user or interactive activity with that user or more than one such user . Such a sequence of actions might be recorded retrieved transmitted or received similar to digital content representing any other type of media stream.

In one embodiment the invention might include bookmarks created or edited using one or more techniques or by one or more types of creators. For a first example bookmarks might be created in conjunction with the original content such as for example by an author creator distributor or synchronizer of the original content. For a second example bookmarks might be created by a party other than in conjunction with the original content such as for example by a secondary distributor of the content a server providing the content to an end user along with newly associated metadata a translator of the original content such as a person adding subtitles in a second or an alternative language or dubbing in sound in a second or an alternative or such as an editor of the movie for a specific purpose such as for example a purpose suitable for airliner use for children or for export to selected countries. For a third example bookmarks might be created by end user preferences either explicit or implicit or some combination or conjunction thereof such as for example in response to the end user designating a favorite scene or such as for example in response to the end user skipping over a disfavored scene or such as for example in response to preferences implied by demographic information about the end user. Similar to bookmarks the invention might also include watchpoints created using one or more techniques or by one or more types of creators as described above with regard to creation or editing of bookmarks.

After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that the invention is an enabling technology by which substantial advance is made in the art of media streams and digital content representative thereof. For example the invention might be used to provide one or more of or some combination or extension or mixture of any of the following 

In one embodiment the invention includes a representation of a presentation state and a virtual machine state each of which is updated concurrently with presentation of the media stream.

A bookmark preferably includes a defined presentation state and virtual machine state to which a presenting device might be set with the effect of providing that presenting device with the capability of presentation beginning at that bookmark. In one embodiment presentation might instead begin at a closest entry location designated by the digital content representing that media stream. In one embodiment the defined presentation state or virtual machine state might include a known title number within DVD media on which is recorded the digital content representing that media stream.

A watchpoint preferably includes a defined presentation state and virtual machine state along with one or more associated triggerable actions with the effect that whenever the presenting device attempts to match its presentation state and virtual machine state with that watchpoint a first sufficient degree of similarity with the triggering condition possibly for a first subset of data associated with each such state would cause the watchpoint to be triggered and a second sufficient degree of similarity with a conditional choice of action possibly for a second subset of data associated with each such state would cause the associated actions would be performed. For example the presenting device might attempt to match its presentation state and virtual machine state with selected watchpoints after each known frame of the media stream or at the beginning or end of each subsegment of the media stream designated by the digital content representing that media stream.

This application claims priority of the following documents each of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

These documents are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein and are sometimes referred to herein as the incorporated disclosure .

Inventions described herein can be used in combination or conjunction with technology described in the incorporated disclosure.

In the description herein a preferred embodiment of the invention is described including preferred process steps and data structures. Those skilled in the art would realize after perusal of this application that embodiments of the invention might be implemented using a variety of other techniques not specifically described without undue experimentation or further invention and that such other techniques would be within the scope and spirit of the invention.

The general meaning of each of these following terms is intended to be illustrative and in no way limiting.

The scope and spirit of the invention is not limited to any of these definitions or to specific examples mentioned therein but is intended to include the most general concepts embodied by these and other terms.

A system such as for example an end user system includes a library or other storage including digital content representing a media stream such as for example in a DVD media content format a presentation device and a presentation controller .

In one embodiment the library might include one or more of a DVD reader a disk drive whether magnetic optical magneto optical or otherwise a jukebox or other collection of multiple readers for physical media such as DVD s or disk drives a communication link to a web server file server database server or other server a broadcast receiver such as a cable modem or satellite link or any other device or technique having the capability of delivering digital content to the presentation device .

In one embodiment the presentation controller might include a portion or be included in a portion of a PVL personal video library associated with the system . The library might also include a portion or be included in a portion of a PVL personal video library associated with the system . However after reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that in the context of the invention no such limitation is required. One such embodiment is further described in the incorporated disclosure.

The presentation controller is in one embodiment coupled to at least one input device suitable for receiving commands or other information from a user associated with the presentation device and at least one output device which in one embodiment includes a portion of or is included in a portion of the presentation device itself. The presentation controller includes a processor program and data memory and is capable of receiving those commands or other information and responding thereto as described herein with the effect that the user is capable of interacting with the presentation controller as described herein.

There is no particular requirement in the context of the invention either a that the presentation controller involves an input device or b that the presentation controller receives commands or other information from a user . In alternative embodiments the presentation controller may act in response to a preselected set of programming instructions or in response to a set of sensors not generally considered an input device such as for example a timed program show or a program show responsive to the presence of people to watch it. In alternative embodiments the presentation controller may act in response to commands or other information from an operator other than a user such as for example a stage director or performer or a remote teacher engaged in televised instruction.

For just one example of such alternative embodiments the system may be devised to make presentations of shows at a demonstration device a sales kiosk or a trade show. In such alternative embodiments the presentation controller might be responsive to a timer to present a continuous loop of the same media stream or a pseudorandomly or randomly selected sequence of different media streams or might be responsive to the absence or presence of heat using an IR sensor light or sound to determine the absence or presence of a viewing audience of sufficient size and in response thereto might be responsive to the audience and its size to present an automatically selected sequence of media streams.

As described above the library includes or includes access to digital content representing a media stream such as for example in a DVD media content format. Typically the user interacts with a user interface at a selected presentation device with the effect that the user might choose for presentation an episode or show that forms at least a portion of the digital content . The presentation device interacts with the library to obtain the portion of the digital content representing the media stream for that episode or show. The library sends that portion of the digital content to the presentation device with the effect that the presentation device presents the media stream represented by that portion of the digital content to the user .

After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that specifications for aspects of DVD devices and methods including DVD audio DVD video and related specifications actually support a more interactive method of behavior. However but that any such interactive behavior involves pre programming that interactive behavior into the digital content before the library or other storage or communication receives that digital content . There is no substantial provision for the user to create a new interactive behavior or to use a new interactive behavior created after that digital content was originally created.

The digital content in a DVD media content format includes a sequence of instructions each either a directing a virtual machine state change or b directing presentation of at least a portion of a media stream. In one embodiment the virtual machine state includes a plurality of registers at least some of which are read only and describe the presentation device configuration while at least some others are more general in purpose such as for example a register storing whether a certain portion of the DVD had already been viewed. In such an embodiment the virtual machine instructions either a alter update or otherwise modify virtual machine registers or b direct presentation of at least a next portion of a media stream.

The presentation device also includes a presentation state distinct from the virtual machine state which describes at least some internal state of the presentation device as it parses and presents the portion of the media stream represented by the digital content . As the digital content is read parsed and converted to a format with which the presentation device might present the portion of the media stream the presentation state of the presentation device changes without necessarily changing the virtual machine state of the presentation device .

The phrase media stream state generally describes a complete state including both the virtual machine state and the presentation state of the presentation device .

After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that the virtual machine state can be responsive to the presentation state although in one embodiment the virtual machine state is unchanged by changes in the presentation state and that the presentation state can be responsive to the virtual machine state although in one embodiment the presentation state is responsive to the digital content .

Watchpoints including their watchpoint triggers and watchpoint actions might be conditioned on other state information or input with the effect that both the virtual machine state and the presentation state might be made responsive to any conditions or data those watchpoint triggers or watchpoint actions are able to test. For one example not intended to be limiting in any way conditional watchpoint triggers or watchpoint actions might be responsive to information of the following types 

A method includes a set of flow points and steps. Although described serially these flow points and steps of the method can be performed by separate elements in conjunction or in parallel whether asynchronously or synchronously in a pipelined manner or otherwise. There is no particular requirement that the flow points or steps must be performed in the same order as described except where explicitly so indicated.

At a step the method receives information such as from an end user or an operator specifying the location of the bookmark and any related information. In one embodiment that related information might include a information relating to the configuration of the presentation device s at which presentation from the bookmark is to be specified b information relating to licensing information relating to the media stream of which the bookmark is a part or c other metadata relating to the bookmark such as for example a title for the bookmark one or more representative graphics such as for example thumbnail pictures associated with the bookmark a set of configuration information regarding how that thumbnail picture would be presented or presented in a selected context or a set of key words associated with the bookmark with the effect that an end user or operator might search for one or more of those key words or edit those key words with the effect of remarking upon the bookmark for one example not intended to be limiting in any way if the bookmark is associated with a time in the media stream at which a great white shark attacks a person the words SHARK ATTACK might be associated with the bookmark with the effect that an end user or operator might search for one or more of those words with the effect of finding the shark attack scene .

In one embodiment at least some of the following information is included in the information the method receives in this step 

At a step the method determines an entry location into a media stream at which presentation devices are capable of beginning presentation without substantial chance that state information for the presentation device would be inaccurate or incomplete. After reading this application those skilled in the art of presentation of media streams including for example media streams recorded on DVD media would recognize that loading a complete image of the state of an arbitrary presentation device might be unwieldy and further might have the effect of providing inaccurate or incomplete information to that presentation device if the exact presentation device and its configuration were not known ahead of time. Accordingly in one embodiment to perform this step the method searches for an entry location at or near such as close before or close after the specified location of the bookmark.

For one example not intended to be limiting in any way the entry location might be one such as defined by the DVD specification also described in J. T DVD D 2ed. 2001 McGraw Hill New York ISBN 0 07 135026 8 . Further information is also available in a DVD accompanying that book and sold therewith. For DVD an entry location is a defined location in the DVD digital content representing a media stream where the presentation device can begin execution including parsing of the digital content representing the media stream and presentation of that media stream . For each type of DVD entry location there is substantially dictated how each of the virtual machine registers are initialized while configuration registers for the presentation device are substantially untouched. This has the effect that each entry location is associated with a specific state of the presentation device which might be further parameterized by configuration settings for that presentation device. After reading this application those skilled in the art of presentation of media streams including for example media streams recorded on DVD media would recognize that the set of all possible states for presentation devices that might be specified by entry locations is a relatively small subset of the set of all possible states for presentation devices specified by entry locations or not .

At a step the method determines a substantially complete description of a desired state of the presentation device in response to the information received in the step and the entry location determined in the step . In one embodiment this substantially complete description might include either a a substantially complete description of the actual desired state of the presentation device including configuration information substantially matching the actual presentation device or b a substantially complete description of the entry location including any further changes in state involved in bringing the presentation device from that entry location to its desired state and any configuration information involved in bringing the presentation device to its desired state.

At a step the method associates the information it determined with the selected bookmark. In one embodiment the method records that information in association with the selected bookmark such as for example in a database of such bookmarks and maintains that information for later access by an end user operator or the presentation device.

At a flow point B the method has created a bookmark and is ready to either do so again or to do something else.

At a step the method retrieves information associated with the designated bookmark. In one embodiment that information is the information described with regard to the steps in the section beginning at the flow point A Creating Bookmarks. 

At a step the method changes the state of the presentation device in accordance with the information associated with the designated bookmark. As part of this step for example not intended to be limiting in any way if the designated bookmark indicates a selected entry location in the digital content representing the media stream the method changes the state of the presentation device to substantially equal information associated with that selected entry location. As part of this step for example not intended to be limiting in any way if the designated bookmark indicates any specified configuration information for the presentation device the method changes the state of the presentation device to substantially equal that configuration information associated with the designated bookmark.

This step has the effect that the presentation device is changed to a state from which it can begin presentation from the designated bookmark substantially as if the presentation device has reached that designated bookmark in the ordinary course of parsing the digital content associated with the media stream and presenting that media stream.

At a step the method causes the presentation device to be started with the state set in the previous step with the effect described in the previous state that the presentation device can begin presentation from the designated bookmark.

At a flow point B the method has begun presentation from a designated bookmark and is ready to either do so again or to do something else.

At a step similar to the step the method receives information such as from an end user or an operator specifying the nature of the watchpoint including a set of a triggering information including a designated state information for the presentation device with which method can compare with the actual state information of the presentation device and b consequent actions including a designated set of actions for the method to take in response to when the watchpoint is triggered.

In one embodiment the information specifying the triggering information for the watchpoint includes a set of register values specifying a class of states in which the presentation device might be found. This class of states includes both presentation state indicating a state of the presentation of the media stream to an end user and virtual machine state indicating a state of the virtual machine model of parsing the digital content representing the media stream. These states are herein called a class of states as there might be more than one state for the presentation device for which the method will consider that the state of the presentation device matches the triggering information for the watchpoint.

After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that bookmarks are capable of being treated as very general labels or references to presentation locations or presentation state. Bookmarks might be the target of a transfer of control or change in presentation state might be stored independently of the media stream they reference and might be subject to variable interpretation in response to known parameters. For example a bookmark might point to the opening scene of Shrek or a bookmark might point to the opening scene of the current movie where the current movie is a parameter that might vary in response to what movie is actually being presented at the time.

After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that watchpoints are capable of being treated as having very general conditional watchpoint triggers and very general conditional watchpoint actions. As noted above watchpoints have substantial if then functionality possibly having conditional watchpoint triggers conditional watchpoint actions or both. For a first example not intended to be limiting in any way a watchpoint might include a watchpoint trigger and a watchpoint action of the class user input X go to bookmark Y . For a second example not intended to be limiting in any way a watchpoint might include watchpoint trigger and a watchpoint action of the class presentation state within class X do arbitrary action Y . For a third example not intended to be limiting in any way a watchpoint might include watchpoint trigger and a watchpoint action of the class presentation state within class X1 user input X2 go to bookmark Y1 and also do arbitrary action Y2 .

After reading this application those skilled in the art would also recognize that bookmarks and watchpoints are very generally capable of being created edited or removed dynamically. All such concepts are within the scope and spirit of the invention and would be workable using the present disclosure without undue experimentation or further invention.

After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that another distinction can be made between blocking techniques for example waiting at each change of presentation state or user inputs to review the new class of presentation state or user inputs with the effect of determining if a watchpoint has been triggered and polling techniques for example periodically or in response to an interrupt reviewing the presentation state or user inputs to review the new class of presentation state or user inputs with the effect of determining if a watchpoint has been triggered . All such concepts are within the scope and spirit of the invention and would be workable using the present disclosure without undue experimentation or further invention.

In one embodiment at least some of the triggering information includes either a class of virtual machine states such as for example a set of values that must be satisfied by the virtual machine or a class of presentation states such as for example a set of values that must be satisfied by the virtual machine . For one example not intended to be limiting in any way the triggering information might specify one or more of the following possible triggers 

At a flow point B the method has created a watchpoint and is ready to either do so again or to do something else.

At a step performed during presentation of the media stream the method determines if any of the triggering information either alone or in combination triggers the watchpoint. In one embodiment the watchpoint might include Boolean or other logical aggregates of triggering information. For a first example not intended to be limiting in any way a watchpoint might be triggered by having the word shark appear in both the text information and in the presentation information such as shouted by an actor . For a second example not intended to be limiting in any way a watchpoint might be triggered by having at least two actors from a selected set such as for example the set Marylin Monroe Kim Novak Geena Davis appear on screen concurrently.

At a step the method marks the watchpoint as being triggered and retrieves information relating to consequent actions including as described above a designated set of actions for the method to take in response to when the watchpoint is triggered.

In one embodiment at least some of the consequent actions might include altering some of the virtual machine states or the presentation states such as for example altering the order or locus of presentation or might include actions relating to the home theatre system itself such as for example altering the house lights changing the volume or shutting the system down .

In one embodiment the consequent actions of the watchpoint might themselves be conditional on a class of presentation states or virtual machine states of the presentation device with the effect that the watchpoint both a conditionally triggers and b conditionally selects consequent actions in response to possibly different aspects of the presentation states or virtual machine states of the presentation device .

For some examples not intended to be limiting in any way the consequent actions of the watchpoint might be conditional on one or more of the following sets of information 

In one embodiment the consequent actions of the watchpoint in combination or conjunction with features of bookmarks can be combined to enable the following features among others. After reading this application those skilled in the art would recognize that further concepts and extensions consistent with these features would be workable that such further concepts and extensions are within the scope and spirit of the invention and that such further concepts and extensions would not require undue experimentation or further invention.

At a step the method performs the consequent actions including as described above a designated set of actions for the method to take in response to when the watchpoint is triggered. As described above the consequent actions might include transfer of a locus of presentation to a selected bookmark.

At a flow point B the method has triggered selected behavior at a designated watchpoint and is ready to either do so again or to do something else.
