The present disclosure relates generally to communication devices configured for wireless communications such as IEEE 802.11 type communications including techniques for facilitating communications over first and second wireless connections of a wireless transceiver.

A wireless communication device such as a portable battery powered wireless telephony device may be configured to communicate in wireless communication networks. For example such a device may communicate via access points APs of wireless local area networks WLANs in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards or the like. Such devices may also communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device.

A wireless communication device of the present disclosure includes a first wireless transceiver and a second wireless transceiver. The wireless device is configured for communicating via the first wireless transceiver over a first wireless connection with a first device where communications to and from the wireless device are addressed with a first universally administered hardware address assigned to the first wireless transceiver. The wireless device is further configured for communicating via the first wireless transceiver over a second wireless connection with a second device where communications to and from the wireless device are addressed with a second universally administered hardware address assigned to the second wireless transceiver. The first and second hardware addresses may be Media Access Control MAC addresses of the first and the second wireless transceivers respectively. In some embodiments the first wireless transceiver may be configured for communications in accordance with an IEEE 802.11 standard and the second wireless transceiver may be configured for communications in accordance with a BLUETOOTH standard. The first wireless connection may be a wireless local area network WLAN infrastructure or WLAN STA connection and the second wireless connection may be a WiFi Peer to Peer P2P connection. Thus in some embodiments the wireless device may utilize the MAC address of the IEEE 802.11 transceiver for identifying the device in association with WLAN STA connections of the IEEE 802.11 transceiver and utilize the MAC address of the BLUETOOTH transceiver for identifying the device in association with Wi Fi P2P connections of the IEEE 802.11 transceiver. The first and the second wireless connections may be concurrent wireless connections.

To illustrate one environment within which the techniques of the present disclosure may be practiced illustrates a wireless communication device which may communicate in a communication system . In the communication system wireless device may communicate with one or more wireless communication networks. For example wireless device may communicate with a wireless communication network which is a wireless local area network WLAN . Here wireless network and wireless device may operate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards.

In this example wireless network has a plurality of wireless access points APs and for wireless communications with wireless device . WLANs may be identified by a wireless device with use of a wireless network identifier which is communicated from the WLAN. The wireless network identifier may be for example a Set Service Identifier SSID or Extended SSID ESSID . In this example wireless network includes one or more servers a redirect server and a gateway . Server may provide data applications and or functionality for communication services for wireless device .

Wireless network may be a public Wi Fi hotspot for public use and include what may be referred to as a captive portal or walled garden. For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway is configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality as well as to permit or deny external access outside of wireless network to Internet . To do this gateway has a set of IP address filters which define a set of addresses that are permissible impermissible if any at all for access by devices. Access by a device depends on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization.

Typically when a request by a device in wireless network is made prior to proper authorization gateway is configured to redirect the request to redirect server . In response redirect server is configured to respond to wireless device to provide data for producing information e.g. Web page information which is rendered in a visual display of wireless device via a Web browser application. The information may solicit a user response. For example the information may solicit a user registration or login with user fields for entering a user name and or password information. Gateway identifies whether the received user response is sufficient e.g. whether the user name and password match prestored user name and password information whether the user payment is accepted whether the user acceptance is confirmed etc. . If the user response is deemed sufficient gateway permits access to the data applications and or functionality in or outside of wireless network .

Wireless device may also operate for communications in other different wireless networks such as a wireless network which is also a WLAN. In this example wireless network is a private communication network of an enterprise e.g. an organization a company a corporation etc. of wireless device . Similar to wireless network wireless network has a plurality of wireless APs and one or more servers and a gateway . For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway may be configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality offered via wireless network depending on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization. For devices attempting to access wireless network via Internet gateway is configured to permit or deny internal access to the data applications and or functionality in wireless network .

Such wireless networks e.g. infrastructure WLANs may provide or allow access to various data and communication services to its terminals. For example the wireless networks may provide for communication access to Internet via the Web browser application or voice telephony communication service with use of Voice over IP VoIP communication or other communication services. For push type data or message synchronization services for example wireless device may be enabled to maintain data synchronization with a server e.g. server or for user data of an application associated with a user account. The application of wireless device and the server may be or include for example an electronic mail e mail application program for the communication of e mail messages.

PLMN includes a core network a plurality of base station controllers such as a base station controller BSC coupled to core network and a plurality of base stations such as a base station BS and a base station coupled to associated BSCs . Core network BSC and BS operate in a conventional fashion as well documented. Other PLMNs in the environment have a similar or the same architecture as PLMN . For communication with PLMNs wireless device may be configured in accordance with one or more cellular telecommunication standards such as Global Systems for Mobile GSM and or General Packet Radio Service GPRS technologies. However such wireless device may additionally or alternatively operate in accordance with other such cellular standards such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE or Enhanced GPRS EGPRS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Long Term Evolution LTE or EVolution Data Only EV DO for CDMA technologies as a few examples.

Further in additional to being operative for communications with infrastructure WLANs e.g. IEEE 802.11 infrastructure WLANs wireless device may additionally or alternatively communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device. The Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Accordingly illustrating further in wireless device and one or more other wireless devices and in may be operative to establish Wi Fi P2P wireless network connections with each other in a Wi Fi P2P wireless network. Here one of the communicate devices may be configured to enter into an AP mode of operation so that other communication devices may associate with them for direct RF communications therebetween. An AP mode of operation which may be referred to as a wireless AP mode or the like provides a benefit due to the high data rates available over WLAN links. Here again data may be communicated directly between the wireless devices without the data traversing any wireless network infrastructure where one of the devices is set to operate or serve as an AP switching operation from as an end terminal and the other device operates as an end terminal to associate and connect with the AP i.e. wireless device operating as an AP for communications.

Examples of such types are as follows a computer an input device a printer a camera a display monitor a gaming device an audio device a multimedia device or a telephone device.

Properties in profiles may additionally or alternatively include a service type property which indicates a service type which identifies the service associated with the device. For example the service types may be or include the appropriate service types as described in the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification e.g. in Annex E thereof . Examples of such types are as follows a file sharing service or a printing service. Alternatively examples of such types are as follows Apple File Sharing AFP service or AFP over TCP service or IP Printing IPP Bonjour service.

Properties in profiles may additionally or alternatively include a discovery mode property which indicates a mode utilized for the discovery of devices for the Wi Fi P2P wireless network connection. The discovery mode property may be set to one of the following a triggered mode of discovery or a periodic mode of discovery. Alternatively the discovery mode may be set to one of the following a triggered mode of discovery a periodic mode of discovery or a Group Owner GO mode of discovery.

It is noted that many peer to peer use cases for Wi Fi P2P wireless networking lend themselves to different modes of operation. For example if a wireless device supports a network gateway feature e.g. a mobile hotspot or MHO feature then the wireless device may be configured to establish a persistent Wi Fi P2P wireless network when the service is enabled. As another example the same wireless device may require a printer service to allow an application to print a document. In this case the Wi Fi P2P wireless network may be established on demand based on an application trigger. In another example a social networking application may periodically search for other communication devices running the same social networking application which may result in the wireless device operating in a periodic discovery mode for other devices which advertise the same service.

To accommodate for such various use cases profiles associated with the various application services utilizing Wi Fi P2P wireless networks are created and stored on the wireless device. These profiles are enabled when needed such as enabled in response to an activation of an application associated therewith. Further the profiles may be enabled concurrently.

In one embodiment the profiles may have data structures defined for compatibility with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification. Each profile may include information specific to Wi Fi P2P wireless network operation including device discovery behavior service discovery options co existence with infrastructure connectivity as well as operational characteristics of the network e.g. whether it is persistent or triggered on application launch .

These profiles may be provisioned as defaults in the wireless device and or may be configured by applications when installed. Further the profiles may be configured via the user interface of the wireless device with use of a human machine interface HMI application that provides management of the profiles. This HMI application may be configured to provide the ability to search for and identify any Wi Fi P2P wireless networks.

The profiles are used to manage the behavior of the WLAN or Wi Fi driver of the wireless device to accommodate for the various application services. The driver may be configured to support each particular use case. More particularly the driver may use the profile information to manage peer to peer communications on the wireless device as well as to arbitrate between Wi Fi P2P wireless network and other modes of connectivity e.g. infrastructure STA mode . The driver may be further configured to support other application requirements such as sleep modes discovery modes and or co existence with an infrastructure network connection over WLAN etc. An example set of properties and or parameters relating to the behavioral characteristics were provided earlier above.

Note that in section 2.4.3 P2P Device addressing of the Wi Fi P2P Technical specification it is described that a P2P Device shall have a P2P Device Address conforming to the format as described in 7.1.3.3.1 of IEEE Std 802.11 2007 1 which is used to uniquely reference that P2P Device. The P2P Device Address of a P2P Device shall be its globally administered MAC address or its globally administered MAC address with the locally administered bit set. The P2P Device Address shall be used as the receiver address RA for all frames sent to a P2P Device during P2P Discovery with the sole exception of using a broadcast receiver address in a Probe Request. The P2P Device Address shall be used as the transmitter address TA for all frames sent by a P2P Device during P2P Discovery. 

The original IEEE 802 MAC address utilizes MAC 48. With MAC 48 there are 2 i.e. 281 474 976 710 656 possible MAC addresses. In its most common format the 48 bit code of the MAC address is divided into 12 hex digits. The hexadecimal notation is used at least to differentiate it from IP addresses that use decimal notation. The first 6 hex digits identify the manufacturer of the device while the later 6 hex digits are the serial number of the device. The MAC address is usually written in 6 octets separated by a hyphen e.g. 00 50 FC B0 67 2C where the first 3 octets are referred to as the Organizationally Unique Identifier OUI .

An address may either be a universally administered address or a locally administered address . A universally or globally administered address is assigned to the device by its manufacturer and may also be referred to as a burned in address. The first three octets in transmission order identify the organization or producer that issued the identifier and represent the OUI. The next three octets MAC 48 and EUI 48 or five octets EUI 64 are assigned by the producer only has to respect the constraint of uniqueness. On the other hand a locally administered address is assigned to a component by a network administrator overriding the burned in address. Locally administered addresses do not contain OUIs. Universally administered and locally administered addresses are distinguished by setting the second least significant bit of the most significant byte of the address. This bit is also referred to as a Universal Local U L bit which identifies how the address is administered. If the bit is 0 the address is universally administered. If the bit is 1 the address is locally administered.
