This application is based on and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 272979 filed on 14 Dec. 2011 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to a neutralization device that irradiates an image carrier with neutralization light to discharge electricity of the image carrier and to an electro photographic image forming apparatus including the neutralization device.

In the electro photographic image forming apparatus cost reduction for the members is required and downsizing of the housing of the apparatus is required. An exposure memory image generated on a surface of the photosensitive drum is required to be reduced for improving the performance of a photosensitive drum being an image carrier. In order to reduce generation of an exposure memory image an area of the photosensitive drum after the transferring is required to be irradiated with neutralization light to discharge electricity on the surface of the photosensitive drum.

In general a neutralization device is disposed between a drum cleaning unit that removes attached matter such as toner remaining on the surface of the photosensitive drum and a charging unit that charges the surface of the photosensitive drum. However in a case in which the speed of forming an image is increased the linear velocity circumferential velocity of the photosensitive drum is increased and the period of time from the neutralization to the charging is significantly shortened. As a result trapped carrier charge remains in a photosensitive layer of the photosensitive drum and an exposure memory image causing deterioration of an image is likely to be generated.

For the purpose of suppressing generation of an exposure memory image an image forming apparatus has been known in which a neutralization device is disposed upstream from a cleaning device in a rotation direction of a photosensitive drum so as to secure a period of time sufficient for eliminating trapped carrier between the neutralization and the charging.

In a case in which the neutralization device is disposed upstream from the cleaning device in the rotation direction of the photosensitive drum the neutralization device is disposed in a position near downstream from the transfer unit. As a result un transferred toner that was not transferred on a sheet of paper and toner scattered after the transfer to the sheet of paper may attach to a light emitting portion being a neutralization light source of the neutralization device. For the purpose of suppressing attachment of toner to such a light emitting portion a configuration is also employed in the conventional image forming apparatus in which a partitioning member is provided between the conveyance path of a sheet of paper and the neutralization device and an opened portion is formed between the partitioning member and the housing of the neutralization device the opened portion being opened so as to face the surface of the photosensitive drum and allowing neutralization light to pass therethrough.

However in the conventional neutralization device the space between the partitioning member and the housing of the neutralization device i.e. the opened portion for allowing neutralization light to pass therethrough is restricted by the size diameter of the photosensitive drum and by the conveyance path of a sheet of paper therefore it is difficult to secure a sufficient width in a circumferential direction of the photosensitive drum. As a result the substrate on which the light emitting portion of the neutralization device is mounted is required to be disposed in parallel with the outer face of the housing.

In the conventional neutralization device a base end side of the partitioning member is connected fixed to the housing but another end side of the partitioning member is a free end. Therefore in general the free end of the opened portion of the partitioning member is composed of a thin and low cost material for example resin and thus is likely to bend toward the housing side. In particular the free end of the partitioning member is likely to bend most significantly in its central portion in the longitudinal direction along an axial direction of the photosensitive drum. This brings about problems that the opened portion is narrowed in its central portion of the photosensitive drum in the longitudinal direction along the axial direction the quantity of neutralization light to be passed is reduced and as a result the distribution of the quantity of neutralization light is uneven along the axial direction of the photosensitive drum.

The present disclosure is a neutralization device that irradiates a surface of an electrically charged image carrier with neutralization light to discharge electricity of the image carrier. The present disclosure includes a housing a substrate light emitting portions a first end engagement portion a partitioning member and restriction protrusions. The substrate is connected to the housing. The light emitting portions are mounted on the substrate and emit neutralization light. The first end engagement portion is engaged with a first end portion that is an end portion of the substrate opposite to the image carrier. The partitioning member is disposed to interpose the substrate between the partitioning member and the housing and is connected to the housing on a base end portion side so as to form an opened portion that is opened to face the surface of the image carrier. The plurality of restriction protrusions are arranged along an axial direction of the image carrier between the surface of the image carrier and a second end portion that is an end portion opposite to the first end portion of the substrate. The first end engagement portion is disposed in a central portion of the plurality of restriction protrusions in an arrangement direction. The arrangement direction of the plurality of restriction protrusions curves in a holoscopic view such that the central portion of the restriction protrusions in the arrangement direction is closer to the image carrier than ends of the restriction protrusions in the arrangement direction.

The present disclosure relates to an image forming apparatus including an image carrier a charging unit an exposure unit a developing unit and the neutralization device. The charging unit charges the image carrier. The exposure unit forms an electrostatic latent image on a surface of the image carrier. The developing unit forms a toner image by developing the electrostatic latent image which is formed by the exposure unit with toner. The neutralization device irradiates the surface of the image carrier with neutralization light to discharge electricity of the image carrier.

Detailed descriptions are hereinafter provided for the neutralization device of the embodiment with reference to .

As shown in the neutralization device of the embodiment is disposed upstream from the cleaning device in a rotation direction R of the photosensitive drum . As shown in the neutralization device includes a housing serving as a housing of the cleaning device a substrate connected to the housing LEDs as light emitting portions for emitting neutralization light a first end engagement portion a partitioning member and a plurality of restriction protrusions .

As shown in the substrate has a longitudinal direction X along an axial direction of a first rotation axis J of the photosensitive drum . The plurality of LEDs are mounted at equal intervals along the longitudinal direction X of the substrate in a state of being arranged on an under surface of the substrate . Each of the LEDs is composed of an LED of a side view type. The LEDs emit neutralization light along a direction Y in which the substrate extends hereinafter also referred to as a planar direction and irradiate the surface of photosensitive drum with the neutralization light thus emitted. Although twenty one pieces of the LEDs are actually provided as shown in an example illustrated in only seven pieces thereof are described in the present embodiment for the purpose of simplifying the drawings and descriptions.

As shown in the first end engagement portion is provided to a lower end portion of the housing and protrudes in a tongue like manner from a central portion of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X toward the photosensitive drum . The first end engagement portion is disposed in a central portion of the plurality of restriction protrusions to be described below in an arrangement direction.

The housing includes ribs stop protrusions a lateral plate portion and third end engagement portions . The plurality of ribs are formed at intervals in the longitudinal direction X of the substrate . The ribs reduce a contact area between a non mounting face on which the LEDs are not mounted on the substrate and a base plate portion of the housing .

The first end engagement portion is engaged with a first end portion which is an end portion of the substrate opposite to the photosensitive drum such that the first end portion is interposed between the first end engagement portion and the ribs . The stop protrusions are provided such that the substrate which is engaged between the first end engagement portion and the ribs does not deviate in a direction away from the photosensitive drum . The plurality of stop protrusions are formed in the longitudinal direction X of the substrate . Although two pieces of the stop protrusions are illustrated in the drawings there may be three or more pieces thereof.

As shown in the pair of lateral plate portions is disposed to face each other at ends of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X. The third end engagement portions are shaped like a long hole and a pair thereof is provided to the pair of lateral plate portions respectively. A pair of third end portions as end portions of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X is engaged with the pair of third end engagement portions respectively. By engaging the pair of third end portions of the substrate with the pair of third end engagement portions of the housing the substrate is supported to the housing as a both end supported beam.

The partitioning member suppresses attachment of toner to the LEDs . The partitioning member is formed of resin with low rigidity at low cost and has a length substantially identical to that of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X of the substrate . The partitioning member is disposed so as to interpose the substrate between the partitioning member and the base plate portion of the housing . The partitioning member is fixed and connected to the lower end portion of the housing on a base end portion side. The base end portion is an end portion that is located at the furthest position from the photosensitive drum in the direction Y in which the substrate extends. As a result an opened portion is formed between the partitioning member and the base plate portion of the housing . The opened portion is a space for allowing neutralization light to pass therethrough and is opened so as to face the surface of the photosensitive drum .

The plurality of restriction protrusions six pieces thereof are shown in the embodiment are provided between the surface of the photosensitive drum and a second end portion that is an end portion opposite to the first end portion of the substrate . The plurality of restriction protrusions are arranged in the axial direction of the first rotation axis J of the photosensitive drum i.e. along the longitudinal direction X of the substrate . The plurality of restriction protrusions protrude downward integrally from the base plate portion of the housing . The plurality of restriction protrusions abut on an intermediate portion of the partitioning member in the planar direction Y of the substrate from above so as to maintain the opened portion for allowing neutralization light to pass therethrough. As a result a free end portion of the partitioning member is restricted from approaching the base plate portion of the housing .

As shown in the plurality six pieces of restriction protrusions and the seven pieces of LEDs are alternately arranged in the longitudinal direction X of the substrate . An arrangement direction of the plurality six pieces of restriction protrusions curves in a holoscopic view such that a central portion of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X is closer to the photosensitive drum than ends of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X. Descriptions are hereinafter provided for reasons why the arrangement direction of the restriction protrusions curves as described above.

In the central portion of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X since adjacent neutralization light beams emitted from the LEDs are likely to overlap a shading effect due to the presence of the restriction protrusions is small. On the other hand as the LEDs are closer to the ends of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X effective quantity of neutralization light emitted by the LEDs decreases therefore in the vicinity of the end portions a shading effect due to the presence of the restriction protrusions is larger and distribution of quantity of neutralization light is likely to be uneven.

In order to suppress uneven distribution of quantity of neutralization light it is desirable to dispose the plurality of restriction protrusions as close as possible to the LEDs .

However as shown in when the substrate on which the LEDs are mounted is attached assembled to the housing of the neutralization device having the above configuration in order to avoid the central portion of the first end portion of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X from interfering with touching the first end engagement portion of the housing it is necessary to insert and engage the first end portion of the substrate between the first end engagement portion and the ribs while causing the substrate to curve in an arcuate line as a whole.

Therefore in a case in which the restriction protrusions are disposed as close as possible to the LEDs in order to reduce the shading effect due to the restriction protrusions the restriction protrusions must be disposed at a distance from the LEDs in consideration of curvature quantity of the substrate when the substrate is attached assembled to the housing .

Furthermore by arranging the plurality six pieces of restriction protrusions according to Equation 1 described below the restriction protrusions can be disposed as close as possible to the LEDs respectively.

Here when a middle position of the substrate in the longitudinal direction is a home position x represents an arbitrary position of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X L represents a distance between supporting positions of the pair of third end portions of the substrate c represents an amount of flexure in the middle position of the substrate and x represents an mount of flexure in the arbitrary point x of the substrate .

According to the neutralization device of the embodiment described above for example the following effects are achieved.

The neutralization device of the present embodiment includes the substrate connected to the housing the LEDs the first end engagement portion the partitioning member and the restriction protrusions . The LEDs are mounted on the substrate and emit neutralization light. The first end engagement portion is engaged with the first end portion that is the end portion of the substrate opposite to the photosensitive drum . The partitioning member is disposed to interpose the substrate between the partitioning member and the housing and suppresses attachment of toner to the LEDs . The partitioning member is connected to the housing on the base end portion side of the partitioning member so as to form the opened portion which is opened to face the surface of the photosensitive drum between the housing and the partitioning member . The plurality of restriction protrusions are arranged along the axial direction of the photosensitive drum between the surface of the photosensitive drum and the second end portion that is the end portion opposite to the first end portion of the substrate . The restriction protrusions restrict the free end portion side of the partitioning member from approaching the housing such that the opened portion is maintained. The first end engagement portion is disposed in the central portion of the plurality of restriction protrusions in the arrangement direction. The arrangement direction of the plurality of restriction protrusions curves in a holoscopic view such that the central portion of the restriction protrusions in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum is closer to the photosensitive drum than the end portions of the restriction protrusions in the axial direction.

As a result even in a case in which the neutralization device is disposed in a position which is upstream from the cleaning device in the rotation direction R of the photosensitive drum and which is near downstream from the transfer unit the presence of the partitioning member makes it possible to suppress attachment of toner before transfer and toner scattered after transfer to a sheet of paper or the like to the LEDs of the neutralization device and to protect the neutralization device from the scattered toner.

The plurality of restriction protrusions restrict the free end portion side in particular the central portion of the partitioning member from approaching the housing thereby making it possible to maintain the opened portion that is formed between the housing and the partitioning member . As a result it is possible to suppress reduction of quantity of neutralization light that is emitted from the LEDs to irradiate the photosensitive drum .

In addition the plurality of restriction protrusions are arranged in a curve line such that the central portion of the restriction protrusions in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum is closer to the photosensitive drum than the end portions of the restriction protrusions in the axial direction therefore it is possible to suppress further reduction of effective light quantity by the shading due to the restriction protrusions in which neutralization light beams emitted from the LEDs in the end portions to irradiate the photosensitive drum are unlikely to overlap. Therefore it is possible to reduce the shading effect of neutralization light due to the restriction protrusions and to distribute the quantity of neutralization light on the surface of the photosensitive drum uniformly in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum .

In the neutralization device of the embodiment the plurality of restriction protrusions are arranged according to Equation 1 described above. Therefore the restriction protrusions can be disposed as close as possible to the LEDs within a range that does not affect the curving of the substrate when the substrate is attached to the housing . As a result it is possible to minimize the shading effect of neutralization light due to the presence of the restriction protrusions and to further improve the uniformity of distribution of neutralization light.

In the neutralization device of the embodiment the housing includes the pair of third end engagement portions that is engaged with the pair of third end portions respectively as the end portions of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X. As a result by engaging the pair of third end portions of the substrate with the pair of third end engagement portions of the housing the substrate can be supported to the housing as a both end supported beam. Therefore it is easily possible to cause the substrate to curve when the substrate is attached to the housing and the substrate can be securely attached to the housing .

In the neutralization device of the embodiment the ribs are provided between the non mounting face of the substrate and the base plate portion of the housing for the purpose of reducing the contact area therebetween. Therefore the heat involved with the light emitted by the LEDs is transferred to the housing side and it is possible to suppress increase of temperature of toner collected into the housing .

As shown in in the neutralization device of the example there are twenty one LEDs as denoted by sub reference numerals to . An LED located in the center of the twenty one LEDs is located in the central portion of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X i.e. a position corresponding to the first end engagement portion . Table 1 below shows positions of the twenty one LEDs to along the longitudinal direction X of the substrate .

There are six restriction protrusions as denoted by sub reference numerals B to B. The restriction protrusions have a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 1 mm. Distances from the middle position of the substrate in the longitudinal direction X to the centers of the individual restriction protrusions B to B are denoted as x to x respectively. Distances from the second end portion of the substrate to the centers of the restriction protrusions B to B are denoted as y to y respectively. In illustrations of the reference numerals x to x and y to y are omitted. Table 2 below shows the distances x to x and y to y regarding the restriction protrusions B to B .

As shown in a distance L between the positions of supporting the pair of third end portions of the substrate is 240 mm. A distance D from the LED to the surface of the photosensitive drum is 18.6 mm. A width D of the opened portion in a vertical direction a thickness direction of the partitioning member is 2.5 mm. LEDs with a half intensity full angle a beam divergence angle of 120 degrees were used as the LEDs .

In the neutralization device having the specification as described above the positions of the LEDs to and the coordinates of the restriction protrusions B to B were calculated by using Equation 1 described above to obtain results shown in Tables 1 and 2.

The positions of the restriction protrusions B to B are values that are obtained by adding an amount of curvature an amount of flexure c 1 mm from the first end portion of the substrate to the substrate a radius 1 mm of the restriction protrusions B to B and a clearance 0.5 mm .

By arranging the restriction protrusions B to B based on the positions and coordinates obtained as described above the restriction protrusions B to B can be disposed in positions as close as possible to the LED chips to . Therefore the shading effect of neutralization light due to the restriction protrusions B to B can be minimized and the distribution of neutralization light in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum can be equalized.

Although the preferred embodiment has been described above the present disclosure is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment and can be carried out in various modes.

For example the embodiment has been described above for a case in which the restriction protrusions with the cylindrical shape were used but the shape thereof is not limited thereto and restriction protrusions with a rectangular column shape or a tabular shape may be used.

The embodiment has been described above for the image forming apparatus as the printer that forms a monochrome toner image but the image forming apparatus is not limited thereto. A type of the image forming apparatus of the present disclosure is not limited in particular and may be a copying machine a printer a facsimile a multi function device thereof or the like. The transfer material is not limited to a sheet of paper and may be for example a film sheet.
