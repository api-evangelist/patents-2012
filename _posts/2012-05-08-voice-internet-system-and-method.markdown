A claim of priority is made to the following U.S. Provisional Applications No. 61 484 205 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE VOICE INTERNET TVI filed May 9 2011 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein and 61 508 639 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE VOICE INTERNET TVI filed Jul. 17 2011 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

The present disclosure generally relates to voice activated Web based infrastructure Speech Portal which accepts spoken input from a variety of devices including desktop and laptop computers tablets smart phones standard mobile phones and ordinary hard wired telephones.

Web browsing is a term used to define a method of user navigation through a series of internet based content. The content may take the form of still images moving images video or audio to name a few. Web browsing typically is accomplished by a user through a manual process of pointing a cursor from a computer mouse and clicking on a graphical user element. The user may also tap a screen to browse. The result of clicking or tapping an element is for a web page to be rendered on a display to the user such as a still image moving image video or audio.

Voice recognition is a term used to define a method of controlling a computer by use of an audio signal namely human speech. A voice recognizer records digital samples of the speech signal processes the digital samples and maps the characteristics of the processed digital samples to a known template is mapped to an event or action. For example a voice recognizer may translate the word call into a transmission on a cellular phone. The word call can be defined as a CallWord.

Before domain names there were only IP addresses. And before CallWords there were only phone numbers. A CallWord performs similar functionality as a domain name. It makes it easier for users to remember how to place a call or initiate computer actions. The caller only needs to speak the CallWord of the person or business they want to get connected instead of having to remember look up or dial a phone number. Acquiring a CallWord is similar to acquiring an internet domain name. The registrant visits a registration portal searches to see if the CallWord they want is available and if it is completes the registration by paying a fee. Then the registrant may login and access a website to configure the CallWords.

Web browsing may be accomplished through use of a voice recognition front end processor. A series of web pages may be navigated by using speech instead of clicking or tapping a graphical user element. The navigation is limited by the stored templates.

There exists a need for a speech based navigation scheme to be dynamic such that a first user may create a custom template or CallWord which can be subsequently used by other users to navigate a series of web pages.

There also exists a need for an interactive rendering of images moving images video or audio based on a speech based navigation scheme wherein a user may be asked to speak a CallWord based on a specific web page.

There also exists a need to allow our users to navigate pages that are enabled by content providers with a unique visual interface that eliminates confusion with recovery prompts by allowing them to see in a visual manner what all their choices are at every level.

Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by using a voice activated Web based infrastructure that accepts spoken input from a variety of devices.

In one embodiment a method of directing an internet browsing session comprises activating a first web page by a user establishing an audio overlay control channel rendering a user interaction control layer rendering a first host audio content based on the first active web page activating a second web page by a user based selection of an action in the user interaction control layer and rendering a second host audio content based on the second activated web page.

In another embodiment a method of establishing an internet based connection comprises activating a first web page by a user rendering a first multimedia content based on the first activated web page rendering a first host command list based on the first activated web page activating a second web page by a recognized speech utterance wherein the recognized speech utterance is based on the first host command list and rendering a second multimedia content based on the second activated web page.

The Voice Internet is a system and method is that is comprised of an integrated suite of telephonic internet financial and speech activated applications which marry the ubiquity of voice driven communications with the distribution and interactive capabilities of the Internet.

The infrastructure and user tools provide end users with a new integrated voice and visual experience while accessing the Internet creating a de facto hybrid unified media blending content delivery over Internet Protocol IP telephony both traditional and Voice Over Internet Protocol VoIP and even terrestrial and satellite radio. These interactive voice controls include interactive recorded prompts grammars and voice activated Web Page states.

The purpose behind TVI is to introduce an alternative user experience to Internet browsing and navigation leveraging voice driven commands and speech prompts in lieu of mouse clicks touch screens or other forms of interface devices and methods. All of the technology can be accessed via landlines or mobile phones mobile applications on smart phones and tablets and with VoIP clients from an Internet connected computer equipped with a microphone either built in or external and speakers.

The system is essentially a collection of interlinked menus and speech driven technology applications that were designed to be ultimately configured by the systems users using SAAS web configuration tools.

Voice Internet Services can be accessed through a series of voice portals by dialing into it including the use of 800 555 5555 or by accessing with a smart phone application or by visiting a web portal that is supported by a Voice Internet VoIP client.

The system was designed to provide a network of interlinked entry points exit points routing applications automated actions and monetization processes that form a contained financial and communications ecosystem. Voice Internet participants can financially benefit by use of our system. offers a top level perspective view of the system.

CallWords are the main control mechanism and navigation points of the Voice Internet system. They are essentially a unique user designated keyword short phrase or Voice Internet domain name registered by a user advertiser individual or business entity that is spoken by a caller to trigger a specific event in TVI s online speech portal. CallWords are available both on a first come first serve basis as well as on a local regional and national level to enable TVI to monetize the use of specific keywords or phrases through different advertisers if they do not elect to bid for exclusive use of a word on a national level. Once a keyword short phrase or Voice Internet domain name is set up a caller simply places a phone call to a designated number which may be either a local call or a toll free call depending on what the advertising party has chosen and is connected to a voice activated utility application. Depending on what action the CallWord is designed to trigger the end user may have the option of requesting that a paperless coupon be emailed being connected to a designated phone number provided by the advertiser being forwarded to an automated survey or virtually any other automated or human driven interaction that the advertiser might want. Users with Web access utilizing CallWords can even initiate a Web page transfer in which the advertiser s Website or other designated Internet domain loads automatically within the framework of the Voice Internet portal thus requiring no additional input from the user aside from voice commands. shows an exemplary embodiment of an Internet based portal display of a CallWords product.

The CallWord can be either registered as a primary top level primary listing or as a sub domain CallWord. When a caller enters the CallWords portal and speaks the CallWord registered by the user the system automatically makes the connection transfers to a hosted speech application or invokes an action eliminating the need for the user to know look up or remember telephone numbers or other access computer access points.

CallWords are a form of Voice Enabled Domain Names. They are essentially a word or a sequence of words that are placed into a specific directory and are registered to one unique user. The user is able to configure the word to perform an action. When a visitor or caller speaks the word the action assigned to it is initiated and will follow the configuration assigned to the action the CallWord was pointed to. CallWords are designed to allow users of Voice Internet to register words that can place calls or perform specific actions. NOTE Although one of the functions that CallWords delivers is similar to a voice dialer the concept of CallWords provides users many other options. The notion of having a permanent registration of a spoken utterance capable of initiating multiple actions and be publically available is an advantageous feature of the present invention.

Before domain names there were only IP addresses. And before CallWords there were only phone numbers. A CallWord performs the same functionality as a domain name. It makes it easier for users to remember how to place a call or initiate computer actions. The caller only needs to speak the CallWord of the person or business they want to get connected instead of having to remember look up or dial a phone number. Getting a CallWord is very much like getting an internet domain name. The registrant visits a registration portal searches to see if the CallWord they want is available and if it is completes the registration by paying a fee. Then the registrant may login and access a website to configure the CallWords.

In an exemplary embodiment from any phone a caller may dial an access number 800 555 5555 to the voice portal. The user then navigates to the appropriate directory and speaks the CallWord they wish to invoke. In an exemplary embodiment a user may access a CallWord from a mobile phone e.g. Android or iPhone as shown in and as described in the following procedure 

In an exemplary embodiment a user may access a CallWord from a computer with a Voice Internet VoIP client installed as shown in and as described in the following procedure 

In an exemplary embodiment a CallWord is added to Voice Internet s System as shown in and as described in the following procedure 

In an exemplary embodiment a call is completed with a CallWord as shown in and as described in the following procedure 

An action may consist of an initiated phone call that forms a communication connection between the user and another party.

Voice Activated Coupon Delivery is a concept which leverages the popularity of discounts among consumers with the ease of a phone call delivering a highly targeted potential customer to an advertiser which maximizes the efficiency from a marketing standpoint. This component associates an end user s caller identification and user profile in order to immediately deliver requested information or to purchase a certificate over the phone if the caller has a known user profile which is detected by the system the system will enable the caller to speak a CallWord and request that an email be sent to them and if an email is delivered to the caller it contains a link to a Website or specific Internet landing page which enables the advertiser to track the identity of the requesting party. In the event that a caller does not have an existing Voice Internet user account they are transferred to a live call center where an account is established e.g. only an email and phone number may be required in order to process the purchase. An exemplary embodiment of a voice activated coupon delivery system is shown in .

These are special use CallWords designed to allow a user to say it to fetch a deal coupon to their computer or mobile device or push a web page or document to another person computer or mobile device.

The same underlying technology of our system will be deployed in a manner to make this function work.

In all cases it is required that the user has an account in the system and has either downloaded our VoIP client mobile application or has registered and verified their name email address and phone number with our system and that this information is readily available to us at the time the request comes in.

For example a radio host can say on air that callers should call in with their phones and say CallWord to get the deal information emailed to them. Or if they have the mobile application they access the deal category and say the CallWord of the deal they want. Finally a request can be made from a computer that has the VI VoIP Voice toolbar installed by selecting the deal category and saying the appropriate CallWord.

In an exemplary embodiment a deal is fetched using a CallWord as shown in and as described in the following procedure 

If instead of saying the name of a company the user says go to or go to followed by the name of a recognized city or category e.g. Los Angeles or Travel the main portal application will transfer control to another speech application that will provide directory service facilities for the requested category. From there the user can select the person or company they d like to call or the action to be taken.

This GoTo Domain strategy modeled after the .com and .net Internet domains eliminates the barrier of oversaturated grammars enabling Call Words to populate millions of utterances while maintaining an extremely high degree of accuracy.

As was previously described this application responds to callers that dial 800 555 5555 or enters the portal on a VoIP client and serves as the entry point for accessing both the public voice extranet the private voice intranet or the Voice Internet Web.

The following dialog illustrates the interaction between a caller and the application when the user responds to the main prompt with the name of a company that has registered a top level CallWord 

Note that the above example illustrates a scenario where Scenario the customer Ketchup and Associates has configured their endpoint to transfer calls to their actual phone number. The customer could also have configured their endpoint to transfer control from the main portal speech application to an auto attendant or otherspeech application. Or Scenario The customer has chosen to be part of a market search action.

Also note that instead of responding with a recognized top level CallWord the caller could have also chosen to respond with main menu or go to shortcuts to access 2level directory services or login to authenticate themselves to the system and access their personal assistant. These scenarios are presented in later sections.

The dialog flow corresponding to the main portal application is illustrated in The main purpose of this application is to provide direct access to top level or to serve as a gateway to other speech applications or actions by supporting transfer to different directory commands.

The grammar associated with this dialog not counting confirmation grammars and commands is one that supports a choice of Call Words utterances that have been purchased by CallWords customers. This grammar which is relatively simple architecturally basically a large in SRGS terms is automatically updated whenever a new or existing CallWords service customer purchases a new CallWord to associate with their account.

This approach allows leverages speech engine grammar caching to achieve the best recognition performance possible while still allowing new CallWords to be instantly deployed. Each night at 3 A.M. newly registered CallWords will be automatically merged into the primary static grammar precompiled and redeployed.

Note that the web based interface that customers use to register new CallWords with the system are subjected to both lexical analysis to avoid CallWord duplication and phonetic analysis to avoid adding ambiguity to the system by allowing new CallWords that are phonetically close to existing CallWords . Only new CallWords that pass these two tests will be added to the system becoming instantly available as part of the dynamic grammar described above and then compiled into the static grammar the next evening.

For business reasons top level CallWord selection is always confirmed explicitly. Recognizer confidence scores are not considered. Several commands are also supported during the main dialog and generally fall into 3 categories 

These utterances result in context sensitive information being played to the caller. Once the information has been played control remains in the dialog. Supported utterances include 

These commands with the exception of more info are supported globally in every CallWords speech application.

These utterances allow the caller to navigate both locally within the dialog as well as globally accessing other speech applications . Supported utterances include 

Whenever a caller responds to the main portal prompt by saying go to shortcuts without also specifying a domain e.g. Los Angeles control is transferred to this application. From here the caller is prompted to specify the name of a city or category domain they would like to search.

The following dialog illustrates user system interaction when the user responds to the main CallWords prompt by triggering a globally available navigation command by saying go to .

The above conversation scenario also illustrates the caller s subsequent interaction with the directory service application once a domain Legal in the above scenario has been selected. This section will only discuss the operation of the go to domain locator. A more detailed discussion of directory service application follows in the next section of this document.

The dialog flow supported by the domain locator application is illustrated in . Whenever a caller responds to the main portal prompt by saying go to without also specifying a domain e.g. Los Angeles control is transferred to this application. From here the caller is prompted to specify the name of a city or category domain they would like to search. The primary grammar used for this application is one that supports a choice of utterances each of which identify a domain recognized as part of the CallWords service. Domains are organized both by city e.g. Los Angeles and by category e.g. airlines . In many cases more than one utterance will map onto the same domain. For example restaurants and dining might both correspond to the same searchable domain.

Unlike the main portal application this application will use confidence scores reported by the recognizer to confirm user input. For recognition results reported with a confidence of 0.90 or greater confirmation will be skipped. For recognition results reported to the application with a confidence score that is less than 0.90 a specialized yes no grammar that supports 3 kinds of responses will be used 

The first two scenarios are standard. The third scenario where the user rejects and also corrects the CallWord selection simultaneously is illustrated by the following dialog scenario 

Allowing correction during rejection of a confirmation prompt in this manner allows the dialog between the user and the system to remain as streamlined and efficient as possible even in the face of a recognition error.

The standard help and navigation commands as described in previous section are also supported in this application.

The domain directory service application provides a straight forward search facility for locating the name of a company or individual that is registered in a given domain. This application can be reached from the main portal application by saying a listed directory name or by saying go to shortcuts followed by the name of a domain or by saying just go to and subsequently using the domain locator service that was described in the previous section to locate a domain to search.

Once a recognized Call Word has been spoken by the user control will transfer to the corresponding customer s configured endpoint either a phone number or a speech application such as the auto attendant call screening or voice mail applications .

The following dialog illustrates user system interaction when the user responds to the main portal prompt by saying go to Los Angeles or by using the domain locator application to indirectly select the Los Angeles domain.

The grammars associated with this application are designed to support a directory service application where the user is asked one or more questions to help identify the connection or action the caller wishes to initiate. The actual set of utterances recognized by the main grammar will differ depending on which domain is being searched.

Host Guided browsing enables a host to guide viewers to a web page or a series of web pages by using a speech activated interface and an interactive verbal dialogue. Prior to this invention web browsing and search functionality completely depended on the user s ability to navigate the web and intuitively make decisions on which URL s to enter into the browser s address bar queries to search engine or impulsive decisions to click on links or banners. This invention allows the user to engage into an interactive dialogue with the host to as a control mechanism to navigate the web. An Example of how a host guided browsing session works is shown in .

Current methods of searching the internet require the user to enter a search term review the results and then make one or more selections to visit web pages that are discovered by means of the internet search. Often results from a particular search query can be in the thousands or even millions. Viewers are often overwhelmed by the number of available choices and may only choose to follow one or several links to view the pages associated with the search result.

After they visit the page that was linked to the result the viewer is left to their own means and to view content displayed on the resulting website to either make a decisions to take an conversion action such as a purchase or place a phone call to the business operating the website.

However there are many people who prefer to be guided to a website or referred to a company by someone they know and trust. The concept of celebrity referrals is not new. There is a term call the Opera Effect which refers to the phenomena of a mass sale of a product after she endorses it during her broadcasts. The same principals apply to a lesser degree to any endorsement of a product or service or by any celebrity.

Host guided browsing will create a user experience where a host can be selected to help guide the view through an interactive chain of results. The viewer simply interacts with the host by speaking or clicking on choices that are made available to them during their browsing session.

A host can be in the form of audio or a video format and can be portrayed by a celebrity a music star a talk radio show host or a non famous personality who can provide expertise on any subject material. It can also be am animated character.

As the view interfaces with the host a variety of resulting actions can occur For example the host might ask the viewer what subject they are interested in finding out a about. After the viewer answers the question the invention will fetch another page and the host will continue to interact with the viewer. This adds a sense of continuity to the browsing experience as well as enabling the host to provide an audio or visual narrative of what the viewer is seeing on the page that is being visited. Additionally supporting images can be introduced overlaid and interfaced with on the base layer website.

The base layer website is contained in an iframe so the viewer remains on the original URL they visited during the entire session.

Another example of a user interaction could be a call connection that is placed upon the users request or an internet chat session started.

Additionally the session could introduce a purchase function into the call place a product into a shopping cart and allow the views to make a purchase all by using voice commands during their dialogue with the system.

There are other iterations of how the technology can work for example an interactive web radio show where the host provides accompanying visual along with their narrative. As pages are viewed and advertiser s websites are visited a tracking system has also been developed to charge advertiser for page views and endorsements made by the hosts.

The system is programmed by an interface provided to content providers who can create their own unique browsing sessions add their own audio and video content and programs links to webpages they wish to include in their host guided programs.

Yet another form of guided browsing included the concept of a voice activated deal search component of the system. In this format advertisers place business profiles and promotional deals into the database via a web interface and the program will deliver these results based on parameters entered into the system by advertisers.

The invention is designed to operate on several computer platforms including windows OSX and Linux and on Mobile device systems such as iOS Apple Android and on Windows based devices.

Many carriers do not permit VoIP applications to operate on their devices to permit the operation of our system we have developed yet another invention that allows a separate voice audio channel to run in parallel with a host guided browsing session. Because telephonic voice communication is prohibited on the VoIP circuit a separate device such as a cell phone could be used in conjunction with a tablet. The voice input to the system would come from the phone and the audio visual output would be streamed back into the visual device from the cloud.

Host guided Interactive video is yet another iteration of how the same underlying technology works with interactive video hosts and base layer web pages. The viewer simply talks to the video that is playing in their browser on an application on their smart phone. shows an interactive session with a user with the following procedure 

Instead of a Multimedia audio file being played in the multimedia layer a primary video clip is immediately played and a set of alternative secondary videos clips are loaded into the client s memory cache. In order to provide a seamless transition between videos it is necessary to load a full set of video clips instead of just the primary video. If this is not done there is a resulting delay between the time of the request and the play while the subsequent video is streamed or loaded to the browser. The result is that the viewing experience is interrupted.

The preloading process needs to transpire while the primary video is playing. This process insures that when the viewer says or clicks on a selection in the user interface layer the requested video is immediately made available to the viewer to provide a real time interactive experience.

To provide a seamless user experience the system will use HTML5 to preload all of the subsequent alternative clips that will play after the user verbalizes a response.

Since all the clips are already loaded in the client computer the selected clip will immediately interrupt the playing of the current clip and start playing the subsequent clip. This can happen simultaneously while a new web page is be loaded. The effect to the end user will be that of a perceive intelligence as if the video actually understood what was said by the user. shows an exemplary embodiment of a detailed interactive session with a user is accomplished with procedure as follows 

Radio Interactive Programming is an integrated hybrid media experience which enables users to listen to radio delivered audio content either via the Web or over the airwaves and then interact with the corresponding online version of the radio program using speech recognition technology. This enables radio stations to deliver a truly multi sensory experience as the end user listens to the broadcast they can utilize their voice to interact with the radio program s host and the content which is served to accompany the broadcast with voice direction commands affecting a similar result as clicking a link on the Internet with a mouse. Radio Interactive Programming is unique in that it can be used by a radio station broadcast network or individual radio program host to deliver additional content beyond the audio to listeners it creates an alternative revenue source for traditional media i.e. independent radio stations and syndicates by providing additional means of delivering advertising and marketing messages it can be utilized to deliver expanded content about a specific product or service it can be utilized to generate a call from a radio listener to a paying advertiser which is directly measurable and it can be used to invoke a voice search program to locate a local resource which is especially important for soliciting local advertisers on nationally broadcast programs. The technology for radio active programming is described in relating to host guided browsing.

This application provides a completely customizable answering service. Before enabling the auto attendant customers record a greeting to be played whenever the auto attendant application receives control of a call. Customers also record a main menu to be played once the greeting message has been played and potentially numerous times until the caller exits the auto attendant . Customers also configure a set of utterances that should be recognized and a mapping of each utterance onto one of the following 

The following dialog illustrates user system interaction between a caller and the auto attendant application for a hypothetical ski resort named Big Mogul Mountain 

The following dialog illustrates the interaction between a user that is trying to reach someone that works for the Big Mogul Mountain ski resort 

An exemplary embodiment of the dialog flow for the conversational scenarios application is shown in . As was described above the primary grammar used in this application is one that is completely customizable by CallWords customers. User specifiable utterances are associated with either prerecorded audio fragments for example the daily ski report used in the sample conversation scenario above a telephone number to transfer the call to or the address of another speech application.

This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

Voice Internet Speech Applications may be pointed to outbound call connections to other speech applications to our proprietary VoIP client or to a variety of voice web and other command line actions as shown in .

The CommandWords In Call Assistant provides users with a variety of call functionality before during and after a connected phone call is established whether on the web with a VoIP connection or on a phone or smart phone connection. It also provides a visual component and user controls when used with any device that offers display capabilities or an audio interface in a regular phone call.

What makes this application unique is its ability to connect and reconnect during a call so that all voice activated functions are available during the course of the entire connected session.

Furthermore complete visual and voice activated controls are made available to the user during the sessions. These controls are also available with only voice activated technology during phone calls. An exemplary embodiment of CommandWords Virtual in call assistant is shown in . The CommandWords offers the capabilities as shown in and .

This application provides traditional call screening services by Voice Internet s unique call switching infrastructure. After playing a greeting and recording a brief announcement from the caller typically just their name the application will place the incoming call on hold and then place an outbound call to the customer s configured telephone number. Depending on the outcome of this outbound telephone call the incoming call might be disposed of in several ways.

If the outbound call fails goes busy or is unanswered the application will offer the caller the option of leaving a voice mail message. If the user agrees control will transfer to the voice mail speech application described in the next section.

If the outbound call to the CallWords customer succeeds the application will play a prompt identifying itself and the incoming caller. The customer will then be asked how they would like to dispose of the call. The customer may respond in one of several ways 

The following dialog illustrates the interaction of this application with both a caller and the CallWords customer they re trying to reach.

The grammars used in this application support both a caller s interaction with the system as well as the application s interaction with the customer who is screening calls.

Callers have minimal interaction with the system basically restricted to recording their name which is a raw recording not a recognition event and answering prompts to replay the customer s audio reply or transfer to voice mail.

The application s interaction with the customer who is screening calls on the other hand involves a completely customizable grammar managed by the customer. This grammar as was described in the conversation introduction to this section above is populated with a set of utterances dictated by the customer and mapped onto either prerecorded audio fragments or a transfer to another speech application e.g. voice mail . This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

The standard help and navigation commands as described in section 4.1.5 are supported in this application.

This application reachable from several other speech applications the main portal the domain directory service application the auto attendant application and the call screening application provides standard outward facing voice mail services. CallWords customers use the Messages application described in section 6.8 to retrieve voice mail messages and manage their voice mail inbox.

Aside from support for capturing the user s telephone number the main grammar associated with this application is fairly straight forward and represents the choice of utterances a caller can respond with after recording a message for the customer send review and cancel .

This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

This application serves as a jumping off point for accessing all of the services provided by the personal assistant suite of applications.

The following dialog illustrates a customer s first access to the personal assistant during a phone call which requires authentication and their request to access their voice mail inbox.

Aside from the grammars used to support authentication login and confirmation the grammar associated with the main menu prompt may be displayed as shown in . Each recognized utterance causes control to transfer to a separate speech application making up the personal assistant suite of applications. This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

This application allows a customer to be transferred to a single telephone number listed in their contacts database. If a selected contact has more than one phone number registered for example home work or mobile the application allows the customer to select which one to use.

The primary grammar associated with this application is one that is dynamically composed to allow the customer to select a contact from their contacts database. For selected contacts that have multiple phone number entries registered a secondary dynamic grammar is used to allow the customer to indicate which phone number to dial. This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

This application allows a customer to select a previously uploaded file to email to someone in their contacts database.

The operation itself is handled by a different backend system. A repeated failure to email the requested file to the specified contact will result in an email notice of the error condition being sent to the customer.

The following dialog illustrates how a customer might interact with this application in order to email a previously uploaded Word document that has been associated with an utterance of resume to an individual listed in the customer s contacts database.

The grammars associated with this dialog allow a customer to select a previously uploaded file by saying a preconfigured utterance to then select someone from their contact list indicating who the file should be emailed to. This application uses a single explicit confirmation step to confirm both the file and contact selection. If a recognition error has been made while gathering either or both of these pieces of information the application asks the user if they need to correct the file selection or contact selection before resuming.

The fax service of the personal assistant is actually identical in nature to the send application in terms of dialog flow grammars and commands. In fact the same application code base is used. The differences between the fax and send applications are either cosmetic slightly different word choices in the confirmation prompts or the selection of the actual operation that is performed once the dialog completes.

For example when the send application has gathered the required information file and contact from the caller and posted this information back to the speech web application it queues a request to our backend system to send an email. The fax service performs the same sequence of operations except that when the information is posted back to the speech web application the request is sent to a different backend system that handles outbound fax operations.

Like the send application a repeated failure to fax the requested file to the specified contact will result in an email notice of the error condition being sent to the customer

This is actually a pair of applications designed to work together one leading to the other to provide a mechanism for a CallWords customer that is talking to someone on the telephone to use speech commands to invite the person they re talking with to join a web push session that allows the CallWords customer to use voice commands to influence what their contact sees in a browser.

When activated the invite application asks the customer who they d like to invite to join a web push session. Once a contact has been selected the application sends an email to the selected contact containing an invitation . The invitation message contains a link embedded with context information to a web page running on a Voice Internet server. This web page which includes an embedded client side object serves as a portal back to the contact s browser through which the CallWords customer can push content.

Once the CallWords customer has sent the invitation using this application and a session established control will transfer to the push application. The push application allows the CallWords customer to use speech commands push to cause selected content to be displayed in the browser of the person they re talking to over the phone. The content might be pushed by reference i.e. sending just a URL causing the contact s browser to display a different web page or the content might be pushed by value for example pushing a photo or other document to the browser . Other commands next previous etc can also be used to control slideshow presentations that are pushed.

The following dialog illustrates the interaction between a sales person that is a CallWords customer and a prospective client that the sales person is trying to close a deal with.

The primary grammar for the invite application is the same one dynamically composed that s used in other personal assistant applications for selecting a contact from the CallWord customer s contact database.

The first grammar used for the push application is one that recognizes a list of customer configured CallWords that each correspond to a previously uploaded file or URL . This allows the customer to use a simple one or two word utterance to indicate a piece of content to push to the person that s joined the session. Once the initial piece of content has been sent to the contact s browser a different QA will be used to allow the customer to provide presentation navigation commands next previous etc select a new piece of content to push push or exit back to the main menu of the personal assistant. This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

The record application allows a customer to use their telephone to record arbitrary audio messages that can be associated with CallWords . Once associated with an utterance this content can then used in a variety of ways 

At the time a recording is made a temporary CallWord is assigned so that the recording is available via the play command immediately perhaps for playback later in the same call . However when the recorded audio is captured the application also sends a confirmation email to the CallWords customer. This email contains a link to an online web application that can be used by the customer to assign a more meaningful CallWord to this recording as well as indicate which recordings should be made available from the play auto attendant and call screening applications .

The following dialog illustrates CallWords customer a Widget sales person named Bob and a happy client of his John Doe to whom he sold a product recently 

This application allows a Call Words customer to play previously recorded audio messages into an active phone.

The following dialog illustrates how a CallWords customer a Widget salesman named Bob who has used 800 555 555 and the personal assistant s call feature to call a potential client Mary 

This application provides classic support for retrieving messages that have been left for the customer using the voice mail speech application that is described in section 5.3.

This application will use confidence scores to conditionally confirm user input using a specialized corrective confirmation grammar.

In addition to the standard help and navigation commands the following command utterances will also be supported 

A significant challenge in speech technology is the cost of deploying applications. During the course of interacting with an application the user exclusively uses a one to one ratio of voice channels and speech ports. Furthermore one or more long distance channels are also in use during the call. CallWords has developed a solution for this problem by developing a technology which allows calls to be received by a local or VoIP switch and then establish an active bridge to a centrally located resource center to perform the speech recognition function. At the completion of the speech session the resource center is dropped out of band signaling data is passed back to the original via TCP IP and the original local switch completes the call. A passive resource connection is maintained during the call enabling the caller to bridge back to the originating speech resource at any time by simply pressing or on a phone or on a control in a speech application or in a Voice Control Panel on the web. This process significantly reduces the cost of speech application deployment and at the same time enables an in call speech media resource

This technology is provided to alter the state of the user experience to allow for conversation during playback without barging into the speech recognizer. The state of the listening will change as the dialogue progresses to allow normal conversation to occur while interacting with the system. The listening technology will only be enabled during specific segments of the program.

When a user configures their account they will be able to choose one or more wake up words that the speech recognizer will listen for all other words it hears will be discarded until it is woken up. Upon hearing the wake up word the system will respond with the user created response to the wake up word. For example the user may say Hey computer and the response may be I m here John. The user can choose to configure both the grammar and also load in the appropriate multimedia audio file. This may be done with video resources as well.

TVI Speech Application Programming Interface SAPI consists of programming code that can be embedded into any HTML scripting environment to enable a third party Website with this API implemented to support TVI s suite of speech activated controls.
