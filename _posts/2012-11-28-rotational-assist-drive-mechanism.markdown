The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to mechanical drive systems and in particular to mechanical drive systems for rotating turrets.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 101 917 issued to Klatte et al. on Aug. 15 2000 discloses a mechanical assist turret drive system comprised of a turret drive assembly that rotates inside of an internal tooth fixed ring gear. The turret drive assembly is driven manually via an aiming wheel input shaft bevel gear mesh shafted sprockets driven by a chain and an output gear that meshes with the internal tooth fixed ring gear. The system also provides means to disengage the drive system if the user decides to rotate the turret by hand.

However because of the large amount of friction manually rotating the turret by hand when the drive system is disengaged may be difficult or impossible especially for those with lesser strength. In addition the disengage components may not ensure a precise and consistent center distance in the gear mesh which contributes to excessive backlash. Also the use of a large number of drive components causes unnecessary friction and backlash. The drive system only provides single tooth to tooth contact in the pinion and ring gear mesh.

A need exists for a drive system that is less complex has a fewer number of components and has less backlash and friction than known systems.

One aspect of the invention is a turret that includes a rotary bearing having an inner race an outer race and a central axis of rotation. An internal tooth drive sprocket is fixed to the outer race of the bearing and centered on the central axis of rotation of the bearing. A turret plinth is fixed to the inner race of the bearing.

A drive mechanism for rotating the turret plinth with respect to the internal tooth drive sprocket includes a housing fixed to the turret plinth. A first sprocket assembly has a shaft with a longitudinal axis parallel to the central axis of rotation and rotatably fixed to the housing and upper and lower external tooth sprockets fixed to the shaft. A second sprocket assembly has a shaft with a longitudinal axis parallel to the central axis of rotation and rotatably fixed to the housing and upper and lower external tooth sprockets fixed to the shaft. A triple roller chain has upper middle and lower chain rows. The middle chain row engages the internal tooth drive sprocket. The upper chain row engages the upper sprockets of the first and second sprocket assemblies. The lower chain row engages the lower sprockets of the first and second sprocket assemblies.

The internal tooth drive sprocket may define a pitch circle. The drive mechanism may include a pair of guide rollers disposed on opposite sides of the first sprocket assembly for guiding the triple roller chain the guide rollers having central longitudinal axes that are parallel to the central axis of rotation.

In a plane normal to the central axis of rotation a circular arc that connects the central longitudinal axes of the pair of guide rollers is concentric with the pitch circle of the internal tooth drive sprocket.

The drive mechanism may include a positive locking mechanism for preventing rotation of the turret plinth with respect to the internal tooth drive sprocket. The positive locking mechanism may include a housing that is fixed to the turret plinth. The positive locking mechanism may include teeth that are selectively engageable with the internal tooth drive sprocket. The positive locking mechanism may include a pivoting handle for selectively engaging the teeth of the positive locking mechanism with the internal tooth drive sprocket.

A hand wheel may be fixed to an end of the shaft of the first sprocket assembly. Another hand wheel may be fixed to an end of the shaft of the second sprocket assembly. The two hand wheels may be located on opposite sides of a plane that is normal to the central axis of rotation and defined by the internal tooth drive sprocket.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel rotational assist drive mechanism may be used to rotate a turret. The turret may be for example mounted on a vehicle or other structure. An internal tooth ring sprocket may be fixed to the vehicle or other structure. The outer race of a large diameter ball bearing is attached to the fixed internal tooth ring sprocket. A turret plinth is attached to the inner race of the large diameter ball bearing. The turret plinth rotates with respect to the internal tooth ring sprocket. The rotational assist drive mechanism is supported by the turret plinth.

The novel drive mechanism may include dual input hand wheels. The hand wheels may be vertically oriented and situated to not intrude on the egress opening of the turret hatch. A user or operator can stand within the egress opening and rotate an input hand wheel with one hand while operating a weapon with the other hand. The hand wheel enables rotation of the turret plinth 360 degrees within the internal tooth ring sprocket. An operator can also rotate the turret plinth from inside the vehicle with the hatch closed using a second input hand wheel. In the context of a turret on a military vehicle the dual drive inputs enable operation of the mechanism if the user is sling seated with the hatch open or inside the vehicle with the hatch closed. In an emergency situation when the user is under fire the user may have to retreat inside the vehicle and close the hatch. The turret can be rotated from inside the vehicle thereby enabling the user to optimally position a weapon.

The input hand wheels drive a triple roller chain using respective pairs of shafted sprockets that engage the outer rows of the triple roller chain. The opposing internal tooth ring sprocket engages the center row of the triple roller chain. The chain may travel around guide rollers that emulate the pitch circle of the internal tooth ring sprocket. In this way multiple rollers of the chain engage the internal teeth of the ring sprocket simultaneously.

The novel rotational assist drive mechanism does not require the disengage feature of prior art systems because the novel system greatly reduces friction and backlash. Manual rotation of the new system by hand will easily back feed through the system. The novel drive mechanism may also include a rotation lock mechanism to ensure that the turret will not rotate unintentionally. For example some vehicle mounted turrets may rotate unintentionally while the vehicle is in transit.
