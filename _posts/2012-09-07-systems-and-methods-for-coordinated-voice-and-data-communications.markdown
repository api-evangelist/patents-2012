The present application claims priority from U.S. Patent Application No. 61 532 713 filed Sep. 9 2011 and Patent Application No. 61 589 820 filed Jan. 23 2012 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention is related to communications and in particular to telephonic and data communications.

Conventionally when a service provider such as an insurance company receives a customer call the service provider must manually input a large amount of information orally provided by the customer during the call into a computer system. This is a time consuming expensive and error prone process.

The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. Various aspects and embodiments or portions thereof described herein may be combined to provide still other aspects and embodiments.

Certain embodiments described herein provide data enhanced voice calls via a communication system. Certain embodiments enable metadata or extended data e.g. text images videos and or sound that existed prior to the call to be provided prior to during and or after a voice call to a called party to thereby provide context for the voice call. For example the contextual information can be related to a business service being provided by the called party to the caller e.g. where one of the parties is a consumer and the other party is a business such as a service provider . By way of further example the contextual information may be personal in nature e.g. where the call is a person to person call such as between friends or family members . The contextual data may be provided and or presented via a mobile telecommunications device e.g. a cell phone application e.g. an application specifically configured to receive contextual data voice communications a browser or otherwise.

Certain embodiments further enable customized menus to be provided e.g. via a dedicated application or a web page to a user via a user communications device to facilitate efficient data and or voice communications. In addition certain embodiments predict queries from users and provide answers to such queries before the queries are submitted. Further certain embodiments identify relationships between users based on information from the users and or other sources and facilitate communications between such related users. Additionally certain embodiments facilitate synchronized many to many voice and data communication sessions. Certain embodiments of the communication system enable data relating to a context of a call to be shared parties other than the caller and called party e.g. with business partners of the called party and or with customers of the called party where the called party is a business such as a service provider . Certain embodiments authenticate a caller via a data communication prior to a voice call being established between the caller and the called party where the called party is informed that the caller has been authenticated e.g. just prior to the call being established and or during the call . The authentication may be performed using an authentication technique previously specified by the called party.

An example aspect is a method of processing calls and data the method comprising providing an application to be downloaded to or installed on device such as a wireless telephonic device associated with a user the application configured to provide a user interface for display on the wireless telephonic device wherein the user interface includes at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate a voice call with a service provider optionally at least one menu item or form via which the user can provide contextual information relating to information or actions to be provided or performed by the service provider cause contextual information provided by the user to be transmitted to the service provider prior to a voice call being established between the service provider and the user in response to a user selection of the at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate the voice call with the service provider receiving from the application at a computer system a call request from the user wherein the call request is transmitted to the computer system in response to the user selection of the at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate the voice call with the service provider receiving at the computer system contextual information provided by the user via the application and establishing a data session identifying a service provider agent associated with the service provider to route the voice call to based at least in part on the contextual information and after the transmission of the contextual information to the service provider causing at least in part a voice session to be established including the establishment of the voice call between the service provider agent and the user. Optionally for a second user a determination is made as whether or not to cause a second user interface configured to enable the second user to provide context for a call between the second user and the specified entity to be displayed to the second user based at least in part on historical contextual information for the second user

An example aspect is a method of processing calls and data the method comprising providing a user interface for display on a communication terminal associated with a user wherein the user interface includes at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate a voice call with a specified entity at least one menu item or form via which the user can provide contextual information relating to the voice call enabling contextual information provided by the user via the user interface to be transmitted to the specified entity prior to the voice call being established between the specified entity and the user in response to a user selection of the at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate the voice call with the specified entity receiving at a computer system a first call request from the user wherein the first call request is transmitted to the computer system in response to the user selection of the at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate the voice call with the specified entity receiving at the computer system contextual information provided by the user via the user interface and establishing a data session after the transmission of the contextual information to the specified entity causing at least in part a first voice session to be established including the establishment of the voice call between the specified entity and the user receiving a second call request from the user causing at least in part a second voice session to be established and causing the data session to be persisted during the second voice session.

An example aspect is a call and data processing system comprising a computing system and non transitory memory storing instructions that when executed by the computing system cause the computing system to perform operations comprising providing a user interface for display on a communication terminal associated with a user wherein the user interface includes at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate a voice call with a specified entity at least one menu item or form via which the user can provide contextual information relating to the voice call enabling contextual information provided by the user via the user interface to be transmitted to the specified entity prior to the voice call being established between the specified entity and the user in response to a user selection of the at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate the voice call with the specified entity receiving at a computer system a first call request from the user wherein the first call request is transmitted to the computer system in response to the user selection of the at least one menu item enabling the user to initiate the voice call with the specified entity receiving at the computer system contextual information provided by the user via the user interface and establishing a data session after the transmission of the contextual information to the specified entity causing at least in part a first voice session to be established including the establishment of the voice call between the specified entity and the user receiving a second call request from the user causing at least in part a second voice session to be established causing the data session to be persisted during the second voice session.

Certain embodiments described herein provide data enhanced voice calls via a communication system. Certain embodiments enable metadata or extended data e.g. text images videos and or sound that existed prior to the call to be provided prior to or during a voice call to a called party to thereby provide context for the voice call. For example the contextual information can be related to a business service being provided by the called party to the caller e.g. where one of the parties is a consumer and the other party is a business or the contextual information may be personal in nature e.g. where the call is a person to person call such as between friends or family members . The contextual data may be presented via mobile telecommunications device e.g. a cell phone application e.g. an application specifically configured to receive contextual data voice communications a browser or otherwise.

Certain embodiment further enable customized menus to be provided to a user via a user communications device to facilitate efficient data and or voice communications. In addition certain embodiments predict queries from users and provide answers to such queries before the queries are submitted. Further certain embodiments identify relationships between users based on information from the users and or other sources and facilitate communications between such related users. Additionally certain embodiments facilitate synchronized many to many voice and data communication sessions. Certain embodiments of the communication system enable data relating to a context of a call to be shared parties other than the caller and called party e.g. with business partners of the called party and or with customers of the called party where the called party is a business such as a service provider . Certain embodiments authenticate a caller via a data communication prior to a voice call being established between the caller and the called party where the called party is informed that the caller has been authenticated e.g. just prior to the call being established and or during the call . The authentication may be performed using an authentication technique previously specified by the called party.

Unless otherwise indicated by the context the term caller as used herein refers to an initiator of a communication which may potentially involve a voice call even if a voice call does not actually take place or even if the call is in the form of a callback from a recipient of a call request. Similarly the term called party as used herein refers to a recipient of a communication which may potentially involve a voice call even if a voice call does not actually take place. For example a user may intend to place a voice call requesting certain information in conjunction with a data communication. However a text response to the data communication may provide the user with the information the user wanted to request thereby obviating the need for the voice call. Thus using certain embodiments described herein communications may be performed more efficiently and the need for time consuming and in certain situations expensive voice calls such as when a user is contacting a business regarding the status of a service being provided to the user may be significantly reduced.

For example certain embodiments enable a user to enter data into a form e.g. via form fields menu items and or controls which will then be provided for display to a party called by the user prior to the called party answering the call during the call and or after termination of the call. In addition certain information may be automatically entered into the form presented to the called party. For example the caller s location e.g. as determined using a GPS cell phone tower triangulation device or other device included in the caller s terminal that receives information from which the caller s location can be determined and or data previously stored in the caller s profile may automatically be inserted into the form. Information entered by the caller may be stored in memory by a computer system associated with the called party. Thus rather than the called party having to manually request information during the call and then manually enter the information into a computer system all of which can take a significant amount of time and may be error prone the acquisition of user data is performed accurately in a timely and time saving manner.

By way of illustration the extended caller related information provided prior to during and or after a call may include some or all of the following information 

the current status of the caller e.g. what the user is currently doing is the user available or unavailable etc. 

previews of documents the caller wants to share with the called party which may optionally be displayed on the called party s communication device as a thumbnail or as a wallpaper visually underlying other caller ID information 

the activity history e.g. a log of prior communications transmitted via the communication system between users and or other interactions etc.

By way of illustration if the call is regarding a medical insurance claim form and the called party is an insurance provider a claims form may be automatically provided to a user when a user activates a submit a claim menu item. The form may include fields for such information as the caller name insured s name relationship of patient to insured patient date of birth patient social security number the insurance policy number employer name insured s employment status an indication as to whether the claim relates to an illness or an accident and if the claim relates to an injury an indication as to whether the accident is work related the nature of the illness or injury an indication as to whether the patient is covered by other insurance etc. This information may then be presented to the insurance agent before or during the call enabling the insurance agent to more quickly process the claim and to determine if additional information is needed. During the call the called party may cause additional forms to be presented to the caller via the caller s communication device.

By way of further example a called party may receive extended data from a plurality of sources prior to during and or after a call from a user. For example if a user activates a menu item for a service provider such as for scheduling an appointment with a doctor extended user information may be provided for display on a terminal associated with a scheduler associated with the doctor from the user s communication device from the communication system database and from the database of other sources such as businesses with whom the doctor has a business relationship. For example an insurance provider providing coverage for the user may transmit via the communication system insurance coverage information for the user e.g. co pay coverage amounts family members covered under the user s insurance policy etc. which may be provided for display to the scheduler prior to and or during an optional voice call.

Optionally the user may be authenticated prior to establishing a voice call with the scheduler and or prior to third party sources being requested to provide contextual information. The authentication may be provided to the service provider and to one or more partners of the service provider to thereby accurately identify the user and to enable the service provider and partners to locate access and provide user related information.

A given data session may be persisted over two or more calls e.g. until the relevant issue that that is the subject of the data session has been completed . Thus for example if a call is interrupted the caller may place a second call to the called party and the information previously provided by the caller is made available to the called party without the caller having to reenter or otherwise provide the information again. Optionally if the time between the first call and the second call is less than a predetermined threshold of time then the second call is substantially immediately answered by a service representative even if there are other calls that are already queued . Optionally if the time between the first call and the second call is greater than or equal than the predetermined threshold of time then the second call is queued for service after other calls from other callers received prior to the second call. By way of example the data session may be persisted until the subject matter of the call e.g. status of the insurance claim is resolved.

In certain embodiments a caller and or the communication system can generate a media rich caller ID including text images sound links to web pages or other network resources meeting invitations and or videos animations. The rich media caller ID may then be displayed played to the called party prior to the called party answering the call and or after the called party answers the call thereby giving the called party context for the call. Optionally if the called party does not answer the call the rich media caller ID may be stored for later access by the called party e.g. as part of a missed calls log .

By way of example the rich media caller ID may include some or all of the extended information discussed above e.g. the current status of the caller the location of the caller the future plans status of the caller e.g. future travel dates and locations of the caller previews of documents the caller wants to share with the called party displayed as a thumbnail or as a wallpaper visually underlying other caller ID information the weather at the current location of the caller the local time of the caller the subject matter of the caller the importance of the call e.g. urgent low priority etc. information provided by the caller via an electronic form provided by the called party authentication information and or authentication verification third party data from other sources which may be user related data identified and accessed from or by the third party using authentication information etc.

Certain embodiments generate or access a customized menu which may be accessed by a user from a social network site webpage an application hosted on a user device such as a mobile phone or otherwise for a given contact e.g. a service provider or a friend of the user based at least in part on 

In addition a user may explicitly instruct the system to include certain menu items in one or more specified menus.

The menu items may include items relating to requests for information requests for services information being provided by the user or services provided by the user by way of example. The menu may be displayed to a user in conjunction with and prior to the user initiating and or participating in a voice call. For example if a menu item is selected by a user via a user communications device a data message e.g. included text images multimedia related to the menu selection may be transmitted to a recipient for display on the recipient s communication device and a call may be automatically placed at approximately the same time to the recipient s communication device. Call answering and call decline controls may be presented on the recipient s communication device together with the data message contents thereby enabling the recipient to determine who the caller is the urgency of the call and the subject matter of the call prior to answering or declining the call.

The customization of the menu may affect which items are included in the menu and or the order in which menu items are included. For example the menu can include one or more of the following items and or other items in any selected order 

Thus for example if the contact is a bricks and mortar store the menu may include by way of example and not limitation items in the following order 

In this example if the user selects nearest location from the menu the location of the user will be submitted to the contact and the contact may use the location information to automatically determine the nearest store location to the user and then transmit back to the user the address of the nearest store. In this example if the user selects hours of operation the request for the hours of operation will be submitted to the contact which may then respond with the contact s hours of operation. If the user selects the call contact information desk then certain extended information may be sent for display to the terminal of the contact s information desk e.g. the user s name and location and a voice call will be routed from the user s communication device to the contact s information desk. If the user selects process a return from the menu the user may be presented with a form via which the user can enter information regarding an item that the user wants to return to the contact.

By way of contrast if it is determined that the user already has an outstanding order with the bricks and mortar store e.g. as determined from a user identifier and data accessed from a database of the store based at least in part on such determination in this example the menu may be automatically altered or generated to include a different set or order of menu items such as 

By way of yet further example the composition of a menu may be based at least in part on the level of authentication of a user. For example with respect to a menu for a financial services provider e.g. a bank if the user has not been authenticated by the communication and or the financial services provider the menu items may be limited queries for non confidential information e.g. not relating to the user s account and optionally may include a control requesting that the user be authenticated so that the user can access additional information. The following is an example of such a menu 

If instead the user has been authenticated e.g. via a userID password a unique identifier of the user terminal such as a NIC Network Interface Card identifier etc. the menu may be configured to include menu items related to requests for user specific and or confidential information such as 

Optionally the user may initiate a session without being authenticated and a first menu may be presented for non authenticated users that does not include menu entries for user account related information. Then at some time during the session the user may opt to be authenticated e.g. by activating an authenticate menu item which may cause pre stored authentication data to be passed to the communication system and or the service provider or by causing a log in interface to be displayed to the user via which the user can enter log in authentication information . Once the user has been authenticated the menu may be updated modified in substantially real time to present a second menu including menu items related to requests for user specific and or confidential information.

Thus the menu presented on the user device has been modified or replaced to include menu items that are more applicable to the characteristics of the user at a given point in time and in an order or arrangement that may more closely reflect the user s interests at a given point an time.

Certain embodiments may involve a consumer and multiple service providers in a single data and or voice communication session. For example a user may contact the user s medical insurance provider to determine which doctors are authorized providers and may at the same time make an appointment with an authorized doctor. By way of further example if a caller involved in a car accident selects a menu item which initiates a call to the caller s auto insurance company the location of the caller may be provided to the insurance company using the user s mobile phone GPS location information via an application hosted on the caller s mobile phone. The insurance company or system may conference in a tow truck company and the tow truck company may be presented with the location of the caller. The tow truck company may send a tow truck to the caller s location while the insurance company continues taking information from the caller. Thus certain embodiments facilitate scheduling of appointments that may involve interactions between three or more parties e.g. the caller a service provider of the caller and a partner of the service provider .

By way of further example a user interface including a plurality of data entry fields may be provided to a user. It is understood that unless the context indicates otherwise the phrase data field with respect to a user interface includes a mechanism via which a user can enter or specify data e.g. text fields menus links etc. . The user interface may be provided via an application an app downloaded onto a user terminal e.g. a mobile phone desktop computer laptop computer interactive television etc. via a Web page e.g. associated with a social networking site or other site built in to the user terminal or otherwise.

For example in the context of an insurance provider interaction the user interface may include fields via which the user and or the user s insurance policy may be identified e.g. one or more fields via which the user can specify the user s insurance policy number member identifier phone number email address home address etc. . This information may be used to access one or more records relating to the user and or the user s insurance policy stored in a database e.g. stored on the user s computer system the system or the computer system of the insurance provider . Some or all of the accessed information may be provided for display to a party e.g. an insurance agent being called or about to be called by or on behalf of the user. For example the information may include details on the user s insurance policy the deductible the services covered the number of visits covered etc. information on the status of pending insurance claims information on past claims etc. This provides context for a voice call with the user and optionally the insurance agent may transmit a text message to the user answering user queries without having to take a voice call from the user.

With respect to a menu activation data communication and or voice call certain embodiments enable extended information to be shared with users and networks other than or in addition to a recipient to whom the user is directing such menu activation data communication or voice call. For example if the user submits a query e.g. by entering a question into a corresponding text field or by activating a menu item that corresponds to a query the query and other extended information may be provided to the intended recipient e.g. a given department of a service provider such as a customer service department and may also be provided to other recipients e.g. other departments of the service provider or customers of the service provided who may be able to answer the query.

For example if a user submits a query via the system to a customer relations department of a service provider asking when a price increase for an item will go into effect the query may also be shared with an accounting department of the service provider and with selected other customers of the service provider who may already know the answer to the query and who can respond to the user thereby obviating the need for the service provider customer relations department to answer the question. This approach may result in the reduction in the number of customer relations personnel that are needed on standby to answer such customer queries. Optionally users may opt in to receive from and respond to e.g. via data communications and or voice calls queries from other users generally or in specific areas of expertise or interest e.g. with respect to insurance related information flood related information medical related information etc. designated by the users system or otherwise. Thus users may collaborate together to respond to queries from other users.

A call may be routed by the communication system based at least in part on extended information contextual information received from a user device. For example the user s geo location e.g. provided by the user s communication device such as GPS WiFi station information or local cell phone tower identification may be used to route the call to a local or closest geographical call center or to agents servicing that geographical area. By way of further example in the context of a user seeking assistance with their computing device e.g. a smart phone the user may activate a corresponding menu control indicating the user needs assistance with the computing device. The computing device transmits information corresponding to the menu selection and the version of the computing device operating system which is then used to automatically route the call to the correct set of agents trained in solving the problem related to that operating system version and the menu item selected.

An API cluster system provides over a network e.g. a wide area network such as the Internet an application programming interface which optionally may be used to provide interfaces to an end user s computer terminal mobile device interactive television or other terminal. Further the API cluster may optionally be used to provide an interface to a computer system of a business client of the services offered by the system such as the computer system of a service provider or of a prospective service provider of the user.

A Web cluster includes a plurality of computer systems hosting a website which may be accessed by users e.g. a personal user or a customer service representative .

The system may be accessed by a service provider e.g. a service provider agent terminal a mobile device e.g. a smart phone operated by a user a desktop computer or other device.

The system further provides telephone call processing for traditional POTs plain old telephone system voice calls voice over internet protocol VoIP communications wireless telephones etc. For example the illustrated system may provide some or all of the following functions 

The system may transmit the status of the call including some or all of status conditions related to the functions above to the caller and or the called party.

For example if the extended data indicates e.g. via GPS information that the user is stationary on the side of a highway the system may infer that the user has had an accident or has broken down. The system may therefore generate or retrieve a menu for an insurance provider contact which includes in the following order a call highway patrol control a call for roadside assistance control and a submit a claim control. If instead there is not an indication that the user has had an accident or breakdown but it is determined that the user has a claim pending with the insurance provider the system may generate modify or retrieve a menu for the insurance provider contact which includes in the following order a What is the status of my claim control I would like to speak to an agent control and I would like to submit a new claim control to thereby provide a more relevant menu.

At state the insured views the menu also termed a smart menu displayed on the insured s terminal. At state the insured selects a menu entry. At state some or all of the extended data is cached so that it can be quickly accessed and or displayed. The cached data may be stored in association with a session key sometimes referred to as a beat or sub session identifier which may be used to later retrieve the cached data.

At state a voice connection is then made e.g. over a cellular landline or VoIP network . The voice connection may be made during the initial data session while the extended data is displayed on the insurance provider terminal immediately upon completion of the initial data session or some time later e.g. 1 day or 1 week later . The call may be originated from the insured s communication device from the insurance provider s e.g. agent s communication device or from the communication coordination system.

Referring to at state some or all of the extended data is retrieved from the cache and presented to the insurance provider s customer service representative CSR via a respective terminal. The extended data related to the user may be provided for display on a terminal of the insurance provider before the call connection is made while the call connection is in progress and or after completion of the call. At state data is pushed to and or pulled from the user s communication device. After the voice communication has been completed at state one or more notifications may be exchanged between the insured and the system CRS. For example the CSR may transmit a form to the insured for scheduling a visit by an adjuster. By way of further example the notification may provide the insured with status on the processing of the insured s claim.

While the above example discusses an interaction between a consumer and a business in other situations the communication may be person to person e.g. friend to friend . In such interactions different types of extended data may be exchanged. For example a user interface may be presented via which the caller can enter a textual description regarding what the caller wants to discuss with the called party and may include a control via which the caller can indicate the urgency of the call. In addition data may be accessed from the caller s social network account e.g. the caller s social graph information and certain of this information may be included in the extended data presented to the called party via an enhanced caller ID or otherwise in conjunction with a caller identifier and the subject provided by the caller. For example the included social network information may relate to recent activities of the caller e.g. recent trips movies attended restaurants patronized etc. that the caller may have posted to their social network site wall.

The system forwards some or all of the extended data including location information for the insured to the glass repair service for display on a terminal and causes a three way voice call and or textual communication to take place including the insured the CSR and the glass repair service e.g. where the glass repair service is added to the call between the insured and the insurance provider confirming that the glass repair service will send a repair truck to the insured s location. The glass repair service then sends a repair truck to the location indicated by the location information which may include a visual map in the extended data.

By way of illustration the social graph may include a mapping of the user s connections with other people and entity and an indication as to how they are related. For example the graph may include a list of the user s friends associates and or affiliations on the social network site a list of companies the user is following etc. The graph may include information on the user s relationship with another user e.g. married living together coworkers social friends relative fellow student at an educational institution traveled together dated participate in sports together co member of a religious institution co member of a non profit service provider customer etc. . The graph may include an indication as to people organizations events or material that the user likes is interested in and or is an employee of. As discussed elsewhere herein the information regarding the user may enable better and more customized services to be provided to the user as well as offering such services to connections e.g. friends of the user.

The social graph information may be stored by the communication coordination system for later use and the system may periodically or upon the occurrence of certain events e.g. a change in user status receive and or request updates to the graph from the social network site. The user may optionally be requested to opt in provide authorization to have the social network site share the social graph information with the communication coordination system.

At state the system may ask the user to provide additional information where such information is not available from the social network site e.g. date of birth some or all of the user s social security number driver s license number insurance provider name s insurance policy number s medical care provider s identifier s e.g. the name and or contact information of the user s medical doctors dentists therapists pharmacies etc. etc. . Such information may include authentication information e.g. user ID password birth date place of birth last 4 digits of the user s social security a token a private key and or other authentication data corresponding to the user s communication system account and or accounts of other entities that the user may have a relationship with. The communication coordination system may then store this additional information in memory for later use. At state the user provides some or all of the requested information. At state the communication coordination system identifies one or more service providers of the user the user is authenticated with respect to one or more user accounts with service providers and accesses the system of one or more of the service providers such as an insurance policy management system of an insurance company that insures the user. At state the communication coordination system obtains additional information e.g. insurance expiration date insurance deductibles insurance limits authorized providers of services covered by the insurance policy etc. from the service providers.

In the illustrated example of a user may utilize an application e.g. a phone application to request information regarding the user s dental insurance policy. For example the user may activate a what are my policy benefits or a which dentists accept the insurance menu item. The query may be passed e.g. as a text message by the communication coordination system to the insurance provider system optionally after a translation to make the query comply with the insurance provider s API .

The insurance provider s system may respond to the query with the requested information via a text communication or a voice call to the user device optionally including an identification of dentists within the geographical area of the user e.g. with 5 miles radius or other specified geographical area that have an affiliation with the insurance provider e.g. that accept the policy limits imposed by the insurance provider as full payment for a given procedure subject to a specified deductible . The data response may be forwarded by the communication coordination system to the user device . During the same session the communication coordination system may provide a user interface via the user s device which enables the user to select and schedule an appointment with a given dentist. The communication coordination system may access the dentist s scheduling software hosted on a system associated with the dentist in order to determine what time slots are available for such an appointment provide for display such time slot availability to the user receive a selected time slot from the user and add the appointment specified by the user to the dentist s schedule.

A relational analytics server coupled to the registration server accesses the relational database and account registration information to analyze the information and determine user relationships e.g. with other individual users and or service providers status and or interests where such determination may be used to provide customized interfaces for the user relevant information to the user and relevant information to clients of the communication coordination system e.g. service providers of users . Further if the relational analytics server infers that a user may have a relationship with a given entity e.g. where the user has liked a service provider the relational analytics server may further infer the user is a customer of the entity or otherwise has a material relationship with the entity and may store such inference in memory in association with an identifier of the user.

The relational analytics server may ask the user if the user wants to link to friend and or share information with the entity e.g. provide the entity with contact information of the user enable the entity to view or access a social network site section association with the user e.g. a user profile messages blogs postings friends wall etc. provide some or all of the user information discussed herein via a caller ID page etc. and enable the user to do so.

A predictive analytics system accesses static or semi static data from one or more sources for a given geographic or governmental area e.g. weather reports traffic data road work schedules holiday schedules etc. to predict what common queries will be received at a given time. For example if a source indicates that there is a traffic accident on a given freeway and all lanes are closed the predictive analytics system may predict that many queries will be received from users regarding the cause of traffic slowdowns on the freeway. The system may prepare an answer to such query and modify user interfaces and menus for users in the geographical area or just for users on the freeway downstream of the accident to include a notification regarding the accident. Thus when a user in the area views the user interface presented via the application e.g. hosted on the user s phone it will include a notification regarding the accident.

A beats management system monitors and manages transactions interactions sub sessions also referred to herein as beats with the communication coordination system with respect to users clients e.g. service providers of users and or entities associated with users or clients e.g. other service providers . By way of illustration in an extended session regarding submitting a car insurance claim a sub transaction may relate to a request for a specific piece of information e.g. a photograph or a completed form wherein one party requests the piece of information and the other party provides the requested piece of information which may complete the sub transaction.

In certain embodiments if an expected sub transaction does not occur or is not completed the beats management system may repeat the initiation of the sub transaction. For example if a client does not respond to query initiated by a user and forwarded by the beats management system to the client the beats management system may resend the query to the client.

An application services system provides information for display on the terminal of an agent customer service representative of the client. The application services system may load some or all of the extended information association with the user caller accesses and pushes pulls data with respect to the agent terminal and if applicable activates a custom application which receives stores and or processes such data e.g. a CRM application a claims management application a scheduling application and order processing application etc. .

A call distribution system connected to the orchestration service system the call distribution system the relational analytics system the beat management system and or an application services system performs call routing for voice calls. An orchestration service system determines when to combine voice and data reconnects prematurely dropped voice connections and or data connections. Optionally if the call distribution system performs a reconnection the call distribution system determines at what point in a transaction the connection was dropped and restarts the transaction at that point rather than at the beginning of the transaction .

An organization relationship system coupled to a client system and a system of a partner affiliate of the client coordinates relationship and interactions with users clients and client affiliates. For example if a user makes an appointment with a doctor via the system the organization relationship system establishes a relationship with the user s medical insurance provider pharmacy etc.

The user may then be asked at state if the user has an account with one or more specified social networking sites. If the user answers affirmatively at state the communication coordination system contacts an application programming interface API of the social networking site which at state validates the user account e.g. by enabling an application to interact with the API on behalf of the user to thereby provide a sign on mechanism across Web mobile and or desktop applications and at state redirects the user to a sign up page. At state the sign up page may display the user s name email address photograph and or other information related to the user from the social networking site. At state the user may then be asked to provide a password. If the password is verified at state a user account is created.

If the user does not have such an account with one of the specified social networking sites at state the user is requested to provide user information e.g. name email address password mobile phone number and or other information for the account which is then stored in memory.

At state the user may be asked to provide still additional information for the user s profile. For example the user may be asked to provide a home address date of birth some or all of the user s social security number driver s license number insurance provider name s insurance policy number s medical care provider s identifier s e.g. the name tax ID and or contact information of the user s medical doctors dentists therapists pharmacies etc. etc. Different information may be used to authenticate the user for different clients companies.

At state the user s browser or other navigation interface is then redirected to a home page associated with the communication coordination system. Based on the information obtained regarding the user and or on information from other users individual users or companies the process identifies other users with whom the registering user has or may have a relationship. For example at state the process may access contact databases of other users the user s likes entities the user is following online etc. to identify other users that the registering user may know as similarly discussed above.

At state the process then provides for display on the registering user s browser an identification suggestions of other users with whom the registering user may have a relationship or may otherwise want to connect to where connected users may share information via the social networking site and or via the communication coordination system and or define an online group e.g. an interest group with.

The registering user can request a connection with a given other user be removed or can request to that a connection be made. At state a determination is made if the user has submitted a connection request. If the user requests state to make a connection with another user the requesting user may be automatically authenticated at state or manually authenticated at state the connection relationship is established at state and a corresponding indication is stored in memory.

Optionally the system may also enable the user to post a review or opinion of a service provider on an interaction with the service provider during a call immediately after a call and or sometime thereafter. For example certain embodiments may present a menu item for posting text or a visual rating e.g. a review or opinion on a social networking website regarding a call with the service provider and the quality of service provided during the call. When the user activates the posting menu item a data entry field is presented which may be an SMS MMS email web form field or other data entry field . If the user enters text or a symbol such as a happy face emoticon for good service and a frown face emoticon for poor service into the field and activates a send control or the like the text and or symbol are transmitted to the system. The system determines which service provider the text and or symbol are associated with e.g. via a call record associated with the user indicated that the user is conducting or has recently completed a call with the service provider and posts the text on a social networking page of the service provider and or on a social networking page of the user e.g. where the system gains access to the user s page via authentication information and an authorization indication from the user . Thus the user can substantially instantly post a rating or review regarding a call while the call is still fresh in the user s mind through a quick and user friendly process.

The communication coordination system can determine user status e.g. is the user logged in in active etc. monitor user communications e.g. via a public messaging or microblogging service such as Twitter and track the status of user sessions and sub sessions beats. The communication coordination system may store some or all of the foregoing data and information in a cache for quick access.

A menu generator may access generate and or modify one or more menus based in whole or in part using the obtained data and information and then provide the one or more menus for display on the user s terminal.

At state the process accesses social network feeds and microblogging feeds. Using the extended data data from the social network feeds and or data from the microblogging feeds at state the process generates a menu enhanced for the user. At state menu defaults are generated or accessed. The generated menu may include default types of information or selections previously specified by the user e.g. a what time do you open menu entry for a retail establishment . At state the menu is then provided for display to the user via the user communication device. Once the user selects a certain menu item a form may be presented for the user to collect additional information prior to a call being initiated.

For example when a user initiates a contact the components initiate a session which may extend over multiple voice sessions . A session may include a discovery sub session e.g. where a session beat management system determines what the user wants via a menu item by the user or via an electronic form filled out by the user . Then one or more engagement sub sessions may be conducted where data is exchanged between the user and the session beat management system.

The call routing engine may route calls from the queue to a selected channel via the channel abstraction engine which creates voice channels and call connections .

An advanced call distribution ACD component manages the queue control component via an ACD interface component . For example the distribution interface component may distribute calls in queued call in a linear priority round robin longest idle and or ring all style.

Computer telephony interface CTI software may be used to enable interaction between a telephone system and a computer system and interface with a pbx system .

If not already queued if a determination is made that there will be a wait time until someone will be available to take the virtual call the virtual call may be queued. At state the estimated queue time length until the virtual call will be answered may be determined or received. The system may apply one or more call handling rules related to the wait time length. A wait time duration may be set at state

For example if the wait time is estimated to be a greater than a first specified threshold e.g. greater than 5 minutes or other predetermined time period the user may be asked via a voice message via an application user interface via a web page or otherwise to schedule an appointment to speak with someone and the scheduled appointment may be calendared for a selected person or someone is a selected group to call the user back at the calendared date time. Thus at state a scheduler may be invoked the virtual call may be removed from the queue at state and the request may be scheduled for later processing at state . Thus rather than tying up actual telecommunications bandwidth having an established voice call where the voice call will later be abandoned without any useful voice communication the utilization of a virtual voice call allows a determination to be made as to whether it is appropriate to establish an actual voice call.

Optionally a wait time may not be based or wholly based on whether someone is available to take the actual voice call. The wait time may be set so as to allow time to determine if the user may be provided with a requested service or information without the need for a voice call e.g. from an automated response system or from another source such as another customer .

By way of further example if the estimated wait time is less than or equal to the first specified threshold the user may be asked to wait until the user is connected via a voice call and an estimated wait time may be provided to the user and disconnect parameters may be set at state . The system may collect and store session information e.g. information provided by a user regarding a transaction such as an insurance claim submittal . Thus if an actual call is dropped and then the user is reconnected via a subsequent call which may be placed by the communication system calling the user calling a designated call recipient and bridging the calls the user interaction with the contact may start at the point of the call was dropped rather than at the beginning of the interaction. After the call is dropped a user interface may be displayed to the user indicating that the user will be called back within a certain time period e.g. within 30 seconds 45 seconds 1 minute or other time period .

Optionally disconnect parameters may specify one or more rules that may be applied with respect to a dropped call and a subsequent call with respect to a user. For example the rule may specify that if the subsequent call is within a specified period of time after the original call was dropped the subsequent call will connected to the same person the user was speaking with prior to the dropping of the call. If instead the user activates the menu item to reestablished the call after the specified period of time after the original call was dropped the subsequent call will queued as a virtual call and the process discussed above may similarly be repeated e.g. the call may be placed at the end of the voice queue . However the data session may be persisted from the original call to the subsequent call so that the interaction can begin substantially where it left off.

After the disconnect parameters are set at state a voice connection is established between the user and the contact e.g. a customer service representative of the contact . At state extended information and or external information may be provided for display to the contact on a contact terminal. At state two way communication is then established between the user and contact. A determination is made at state as to whether the call relates to a new transaction or is a continuing part of a previously initiated transaction. If the call is related to an existing transaction at state the call is assigned to an existing sub session e.g. the sub session identifier of the existing sub session is associated with the call . If the call is not related to an existing transaction at state a new sub session is established and the call is assigned to the new sub session and associated with the identifier of the new sub session .

At state the user may allow the communication coordination system access to the user s contacts e.g. from the contact data store on the user s phone Microsoft Outlook Google s Gmail the social network site etc. . At state the communication coordination system may utilize the user s contact and social network site information to identify and determine relationships the user has or may have with other individual users or business entities. Further the communication coordination system may use the foregoing information to define matches and groups to which the user belongs or which may be suitable for the user. The groups may be defined as users that are customers of a particular business that live in a particular geographic area that are connected via a social networking site etc. Such grouping information may enable an entity such as a service provider to target information relevant to the group. For example if there is a tornado warning in a specific geographic area an insurance provider may transmit a tornado warning notification to its customers within the geographic area and not to users that are not in the affected area who would be relatively uninterested in the tornado warning .

At state the user initiates a call to an entity such as a service provider e.g. by selecting an appropriate menu item or contact icon presented on the user s telecommunication device as similarly discussed above and the system initiates a sub session and assigns a corresponding sub session identifier. At state the communication coordination system registers the call. At state data is pushed to or pulled from the user e.g. via an application hosted on the user telecommunication device by a second user e.g. a call center agent of the entity to which the user initiated contact via the second user s system.

At state a third user related to the second user e.g. where the third user provides a complimentary service to a service being provided by the second user is added to the sub session and optionally the call by the second user. For example the second user may be a medical insurance provider and the third user may be a medical services provider e.g. a physician dentist podiatrist pharmacy etc. .

A relationship manager may access the social graph CRM system and user contacts in order to authenticate the user identify relationships of the user e.g. with other individual users and or service providers user status and or user interests as similarly discussed above with respect to the relational analytics system.

The ordering of the tiles or listing of connections may be dynamically changed based on one or more parameters. For example connections that are geographically close to the user s current location e.g. as determined via the user s mobile device location information may be displayed relatively higher up or more prominently than those that are geographically far way other factors being equal. Other example factors may include some or all of the following and or other factors 

In addition fields are provided via which the recipient can ask the sender questions. By communicating via text the need for a voice call may be obviated.

FIG. AA illustrates an example user interface displaying connections of the user via icons displaying respective images of the connections. The user can initiate a data coordinated call by selecting a respective icon.

FIG. BB illustrates an example user interface displaying a menu of items that will be included in a message that will be sent to the called party prior to the call. The user can select getting together which will cause an interface to be presented via which the user can select one or more dates on which the user is available to get together with the called party. This will cause a message to be transmitted to the called party with the available selected dates. The called party will then be able to select a date from the plurality of dates for the get together. The acceptance of the date will then be transmitted back to the caller.

If the user selects the link menu item the link entered by the user may be sent e.g. where the user wants to share a link with the called party .

If the user selects the a topic menu item the user can specify a custom topic which will then be communicated to the called party.

If the user selects the an image menu item the user can select an image from the user s electronic collection of images to be included in the message.

FIG. CC illustrates an example user interface via which the user can search for or add a topic. This interface is similar to the interface of .

FIG. EE illustrates an example user interface displaying to the called party the user s name phone number member ID preferred date and time for scheduling an appointment. This user interface may be displayed during the voice call.

FIG. FF illustrates the example user interface of FIG. EE including images sent by the user to the caller a map of the meeting place for the appointment in addition to the user s name phone number member ID preferred date and time for scheduling an appointment . This user interface may be displayed during the voice call and may display information from partner organizations of the called party e.g. from an insurance company or other source .

In certain situations such as in certain friend to friend calls a user may initiate a data voice session to a mobile communication device such as a cell phone of another user that does not have an application specifically configured to receive contextual data voice communications. In certain embodiments for example a calling user may access an application hosted on the user s mobile communication device and select an entry corresponding to the friend. A user interface may be presented including a text field and or menu entry via which the caller can specify the subject or context of the call. Once the user has provided such context the user can activate a completion control and a communication is directed to the communication system including the context information. If the communication system determines that called party does not have the installed application specifically configured to receive contextual data voice communications from the communication system e.g. based on an account record associated with the called party the communication system may configure an SMS or MMS message including certain limited extended information e.g. the user s name and the subject provided by the user and may include accept and reject control links via which the user can indicate whether the called party is willing to accept a call from the user or rejects the call from the user. If the called party activates the accept call link the called party s mobile device s browser may be opened to a webpage associated with the communication system wherein the webpage by provide some or all of the functionality discussed above and may mimic in whole or in part the interfaces presented via the app discussed above and illustrated in and a voice call may be established between the called party and the caller e.g. by placing a call to the caller device and the called party device and bridging the calls . If the called party activates the reject call link the rejection indication may be provided to the caller and the session may be terminated.

If a determination is made that the called party s device is not capable of accepting such accept and reject links as determined from functionality associated with the model number of called party s mobile device the communication system may configure an SMS or MMS message including certain limited extended information e.g. the user s name and the subject provided by the user and may include instructions to text back a 1 or other text to accept the call and a 2 or other text to reject the call. If the called party text backs a 1 the called party s mobile device s browser may be opened to a webpage associated with the communication system wherein the webpage by provide some or all of the functionality discussed above and a voice call may be established between the called party and the caller e.g. by placing a call to the caller device and the called party device and bridging the calls . If the called party activates text back 2 a rejection indication may be provided to the caller and the session may be terminated.

In certain embodiments a Short Message Service SMS or a Multimedia Messaging Service MMS may be used to access via a mobile device e.g. a cell phone or other SMS or MMS enabled device call menus disclosed herein thereby obviating the need to install an app on the mobile device in order to access such menus. For example in certain embodiments a user can send an SMS message from the user s mobile device to a phone address associated with a business the user wants to contact via a voice call. The communication system accesses and transmits to the user mobile device one or more calling menus e.g. a phone tree menu for the business. The menus can be provided and displayed both as text and or as a link e.g. a URL to network resource such as a web page or a mobile web page which when selected by the user causes the mobile device browser to access and display the menus.

The system assigns a phone address e.g. a phone number or a VoIP address to an entity such as an existing business. Alternatively the business can provide the system with an existing phone address associated with the business.

The business publishes the phone address e.g. via their Web site online advertising online phone directories emails SMS or MMS messages physical mailings QR codes and or other channels .

An automated voice response system or a human operator audibly provides the user with the option to listen to the call menus or to receive the call menus via SMS MMS. The user may select the desired option via a verbal instruction or a key press e.g. which generates a DTMF tone . If the user elects to hear the call menus the call is transferred to the appropriate business phone number and the user s call may be handled using the business s conventional process e.g. the user is initially connected to the business s IVR interactive voice response system which guides the user via an audible phone tree menu until the user selects the desired person or department to speak with .

If the user elects to have the menus sent via SMS MMS a message such as a text message is sent to the caller s mobile device with a callback link e.g. a 1 click callback link . The system may also receive the user s calling phone address via call signaling information e.g. callerID received when the user called the published phone address associated with the business. The system may store the user s phone address as part of the current session and later access and utilize the phone address to direct SMS MMS messages to the user s mobile device and or to place calls to the user s mobile device. Optionally in addition or instead the user may be requested to submit a callback number SMS destination address during the call via a data session as discussed in greater detail below.

The user clicks the link and the user s mobile device invokes a mobile web session wherein the mobile device s browser accesses and presents call menu options e.g. a list of different departments services or people such as Sales Service Returns Claim Status Directions etc. . Optionally a menu may have an application attached to it as a web page or a mobile web document where the user can select options from a form or request provide additional information. Then the three way call discussed below is placed the items selected from the application may be transmitted to the agent as data or read to the agent using text to speech technology.

The user then selects a call menu option e.g. by touching the menu option if the user s mobile device has a touch screen and a call initiation control which is received by the communication system.

A notification is presented on the user s mobile device indicating that the user will be receiving a call shortly corresponding to the select menu option.

The communication system receives the selection transmitted from the user s mobile device and begins the call process.

A three way call is placed via the communication system to the business wherein the call is directed to the department service or person corresponding to the user s menu selection thereby automatically navigating the call tree based on the callers selection. The system may direct the call to the user s mobile device using the phone address obtained from call signaling information received during the user s earlier call to the business s phone address. Optionally instead the user may be requested to submit e.g. type in or speak a callback number via a user interface presented on the user s mobile device e.g. which may be presented in response to the user activating the menu option . The callback number may then be transmitted to the communication system. Alternatively the system may instruct the mobile device of the user to dial the phone address associated with the menu selection.

When an agent or other personnel associated with the business answers the call the communication system plays a message to the agent regarding the call and providing an instruction on how to connect with the user e.g. Your customer is calling via the Drumbi communication service. Press 1 or say accept to accept. . Alternatively through voice recognition the system will detect when an agent has answered the call.

When the agent provides the acceptance instruction e.g. by pressing the appropriate keypad button or by providing the appropriate verbal command the other leg of the three way call is connected to the user s mobile device causing the user s mobile device to ring or otherwise indicate the presence of an incoming call.

The user answers the call and the call leg to the agent and the call leg to the user are bridged thereby connecting the user to the selected destination. The agent and user can now converse regarding the relevant subject matter.

FIG. GG illustrates on the left hand side an example SMS message transmitted to the user s mobile device in response to the user calling a phone address assigned to the business being connected with the communication system and requesting to receive access to the menu via an SMS message. The SMS message instructs the user to activate a 1 click call link included in the SMS message in order to access a phone menu associated with the business. On the right hand side of FIG. GG is an example phone menu presented via the user s mobile device browser. The user can select a menu item and then select a call me now control. The user will then be connected to the appropriate person service as similarly described above.

Referring to after the user has activated a phone application call control on the user s communication device a notification is presented for display to the user informing the user that the user will be contacted momentarily e.g. by a customer service agent . The call is then automatically routed to a customer service agent based on agent availability and or the context information. illustrates a user interface displayed on a terminal e.g. a desktop terminal laptop tablet wireless phone etc. of a service provider agent providing the name phone number and title of the caller. illustrates a user interface providing the user caller information and a notation that the user is a new caller and that an agent has not yet been assigned. Controls are provided via which the agent can accept the assignment to the caller answer the call view context information etc. If the agent activates the answer control the user interface is presented on the user communication device indicating that the call has been established. Referring to the user interface illustrated in a map is presented to the agent on the agent terminal indicating the user location local roads and points of interest. The map may be accessed from a map site based on location information from the user communication device.
