The present disclosure relates generally to providing recommendations or advertisement. More particularly the present disclosure relates to providing recommendations and advertisement on mobile devices.

One reason for popularity of mobile devices such as smartphones is due to the widespread availability of specialized applications hereinafter referred to as apps operable on such devices. Each app caters to a specific interest or need such as a game or serving coupons to a user based on location. It is not uncommon for an electronic storefront selling apps also referred to as an app store to offer upwards of tens to hundreds of thousands of apps for purchase and download. With such a large app library however comes difficulty in identifying apps of interest.

A particular app may come to a user s attention by word of mouth. The user may search the app library by keyword s category highest customer reviews top downloads or other parameters to find an app suitable for the user s needs or interest. Alternatively the user may accidently find out about a particular app while doing some other task. Even when a particular app is known by the user the user still has to take active steps to engage the app store login pay if applicable and download activate receive the app on his or her mobile device s .

Thus it would be beneficial to provide a mechanism that automatically notifies a user of specific apps that are likely to be of interest to that user. It would also be beneficial to identify apps to the user in a manner that the user is likely to view and engage. It would further be beneficial to provide integrated functionality to increase the likelihood of acquiring rights to an app in response to a recommendation.

The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the terms used. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements.

Described in detail below is an apparatus and method for determining and providing streaming banners including information about one or more items content for display on mobile communication devices. The items content featured in each streaming banner is targeted for the user of a given mobile communication device. Selection of the specific items content is based on information relating to the user including but not limited to user profile preferences user profiles of other users that are similar to the user s user profile latest user activity on the mobile communication device behaviors of the user s friends or those in the user s social network and the like. The streaming banner includes actionable items corresponding to each item content featured. When the user actuates or otherwise expresses interest an actionable item corresponding to a particular item content then a page associated with the given actionable item is displayed on the mobile communication device for the user to learn more about the item content or make a purchase.

Database and database may be located at one or more geographically distributed locations from each other and also from the servers . Alternatively one or more of databases may be included within respective servers .

Alternatively although the first network and second network are shown as two networks the two networks can be implemented together as a single network configured to support both wireless and wired communications. In this configuration servers can be combined together and databases can also be combined together.

The components of are representative of data and code base or instructions software components applications apps modules application programming interfaces APIs and the like configured to be accessed or executed by one or more processors included in the server database server and or database . includes a content store provider component a user profiles component a recommendation engine component and a user activity tracking engine component . One or more of the components can be located geographically distributed from each other. The user profiles component may be located for example in database while the recommendation engine component is located in server .

As described in detail below the recommendation engine component also referred to as a recommendation engine uses the data from at least the user profiles component and the user activity tracking engine component to determine and provide recommendations such as streaming banners advertising apps displayed on a display of mobile devices . The recommendation engine component interfaces with the content store component to formulate recommendations likely to drive traffic to specific content available at the content store component . The content store component comprises a virtual storefront or repository that offers a plurality of content e.g. apps music video images digital media products services and other items content available for purchase or access. Digital content can also be downloaded from the content store component including automatic push to the user s mobile device s upon completion of the purchase or access process. The content store component can comprise a destination or service directly provided by the first network e.g. cellular network provider a destination or service directly provided by the device manufacturer or an operating environment associated with the device e.g. Blackberry App World an online website a third party provided destination or service and variants thereof. The content store component is also referred to as an electronic commerce e commerce store e commerce storefront online items content site application or app e commerce store application or app e commerce site and the like. Although components are shown as distinct components in it should be understood that components may be implemented as fewer or more components than illustrated. It should also be understood that any of components may communicate with one or more components included in the system such as server database server database mobile devices or device .

In some embodiments each of the mobile devices receiving recommendations from the recommendation engine component has installed a device client component e.g. cookies widget modules apps that facilitates tracking user actions activity on the mobile device communicating tracked user action activity to the user activity tracking engine properly displaying received recommendations from the recommendation engine and other such activities. In other embodiments the device client component installation is optional or it not required for the recommendation engine component to provide relevant recommendations to the mobile devices .

Next at a block the recommendation engine component checks whether a trigger condition s is met to provide or update a streaming banner to a given device. Determining satisfaction of the trigger condition s is based on the user activity information received at block or it can be system triggered independent of user activity. In the latter case block may be optional. Examples of triggering conditions include but are not limited to the mobile device being in proximity to a sponsor retailer the mobile device being in proximity of a product detected via near field communication NFC time limit reached for the existing streaming banner displayed on the mobile device a new app available on the content store other user s having a similar user profile to a given user has downloaded a particular app other user s in the same social network as a given user has downloaded a particular app other user s having similar user profiles to or are in the same social network as the given user is using a particular app an app available on the content store matches the given user s profile preference e.g. user just changed his profile preference indicating that he likes games and productivity apps but not reading apps the given user is searching for apps via a web browser or in the content store and the like. The recommendation engine component may access data or otherwise coordinate with the user profiles component and or user activity tracking engine component to check for the trigger condition s .

If the trigger condition is not met no branch of block then flow diagram returns to block to receive additional user activity information and or to wait for a trigger condition to occur. Otherwise the trigger condition is satisfied yes branch of block and the recommendation engine component proceeds to determine and gather recommendation data mining source s at a block . For example if a streaming banner is to promote one or more apps based on apps that other users with similar profiles downloaded then the recommendation engine component determines which user profile parameters are of interest and the requisite similarity threshold. The recommendation engine component also interfaces with the user profiles component to obtain the user profiles. There may be one or more sets of user profiles each maintained by a different entity. For example separate user profiles can be maintained by a device manufacturer a network provider and the content store component . The network provider s user profiles may include more data about app usage on the devices while the content store s user profiles may include which apps were downloaded for which user accounts but limited information about actual app usage on the respective mobile devices . The user profile parameters of interest may comprise non app specific data such as age profession household income product purchase history e.g. shoes electronics and the like.

As another example if a streaming banner is to be configured based on apps that a user s friend has on his her mobile device which could be another one of the mobile devices then the recommendation engine component accesses or generates a social graph associated with the user. The social graph specifies the user s friends and or their profiles or at least provides login or identifier type of information to access social media site s to look up who the user s contacts are and their activities or interests. The social media site may reveal for example that one of the user s contacts e.g. a friend is discussing a particular app or song or other items to recommend that the user doesn t have on his her mobile device . Alternatively the social media site s are used to identify the user s contacts and then look up those contacts user profiles via the user profiles component to determine which apps they have installed on their mobile devices that are not on the user s mobile device .

As still another example a streaming banner may be populated with new apps or apps selected for promotion by the content store component . As another example the streaming banner is populated by apps matching user profile preferences expressly specified by the user e.g. user specified an interest in word games during account setup and or based on user activity e.g. user downloads word game apps .

Next at a block the recommendation engine component is configured to select one or more specific items content e.g. apps music video digital media product service etc. from an items content library or catalog to be promoted in the streaming banner. The selection is made in accordance with the trigger condition and or the recommendation data mining sources also referred to as initial provisional content identification source s gathered in block . If the streaming banner includes information about more than one item content then each of those items content can be selected based on different criteria relative to each other. In the case of the items content comprising apps for example one or more specific apps is selected as follows to be announced promoted recommended marketed offered for sale or otherwise included in the streaming banner 1 select app s downloaded by other users having user profiles similar to the user profile of a user of the given mobile device 2 select app s identified downloaded by the user s contacts friends or those in the user s social network 3 select app s matching user profile preferences or latest user activity and or 4 select app s that are already designated by an items content store e.g. new apps sponsored apps randomly selected apps of the day .

The selected content either matches exactly the content identified by others or matches some aspect of the content identified by others. For example the selected content may exactly match the content purchased by others having user profiles similar to the user s profile. Conversely the selected content may match the subject matter category price or other aspect of the content specified by other users but not necessarily be identical to the content specified by others. If the selected content is based on system set considerations then user activities and interests may or may not be taken into account in the selection of the content. The content store may promote a new app to all of the mobile devices based on its newness alone or target the new app only to those users that have shown a preference for the same type of apps as the new app.

The recommendation engine component at a block configures a streaming banner using the selected content. Configuration includes formatting appropriate for the user s mobile device s screen parameters generating gathering graphics text icons hyperlinks actionable items and other visual information associated with the selected content and generating instructions to the given mobile device associated with the streaming banner such as setting a time period for display or persistence across different screen pages. Streaming banners are also referred to as in stream advertisement in stream ads streamer advertisement steamer ads streamers animated banners animated banner ads and similar variants.

Next the streaming banner is transmitted to the user s mobile device at a block . If the user takes action on the streaming banner displaying on his her mobile device yes branch of block then the appropriate server responds to fulfill the action request at a block . If the user does not take any action on the streaming banner e.g. user expresses no interest in the streaming banner no branch of block then flow diagram returns to block to await user activity information. User action includes but is not limited to clicking tapping swiping or other expression of interest in or actuation of an actionable portion of the streaming banner associated with a specific content. For example tapping on a graphic of a specific app included in the streaming banner causes the user s mobile device to display a detailed information download and or purchase page for the specific app at the content store component . The user may additionally be automatically logged into the content store e.g. an e commerce site or web storefront to facilitate obtaining the specific app.

At a block the mobile device transmits user activity information for receipt by the user activity tracking engine component . The tracking gathering and transmission of the user activity information can be controlled by the device client installed on the mobile device . The receipt of the user activity information is discussed above with respect to block of . And as discussed for block block is optional when a streaming banner is triggered without use of user activity information.

Next at a block the mobile device receives and displays the streaming banner provided by the server or on a display screen included in the mobile device . An example pathway comprises the streaming banner from the server received by one or more of mobile devices via the first network . Another example pathway comprises the streaming banner from the server being received by one or more of mobile devices via the second network and the first network . In one embodiment the streaming banner is provided on the bottom portion of the screen and is included in the locked and unlocked home pages screen. Text graphic icon hyperlink actionable item indicator and other presentation material associated with each content being promoted marketed in the streaming banner is presented as animated elements such as scrolling from left to right or right to left blinking changing colors or the like. Content represented in the streaming banner can be the same e.g. all apps or of dissimilar types to each other e.g. an app a song and headphones . Content represented in a streaming banner includes but is not limited to one or more of a song a video a product a digital media a service and an app.

In other embodiments the streaming banner can be positioned at one or more other pre defined locations on the screen. shows an example screen including a streaming banner provided at a top portion of the screen. The streaming banner can be displayed in one or more apps e.g. web browser downloaded apps in addition to or as an alternative to the locked and unlocked home pages screens. A streaming banner can display on a mobile device at all times with the content changing in accordance with trigger conditions. In some example embodiments a streaming banner can be non persistent displaying periodically for a set period of time or sporadically based on specific user activity.

Once a streaming banner is presented on the mobile device the mobile device monitors whether the user indicates interest in the content included in the streaming banner at a block . The user indicates interest by taking action on the content information associated with a specific content displayed in the streaming banner. Additional details regarding user action on the streaming banner is described above with respect to block of . If the user takes no action with respect to the banner no branch of block then flow diagram returns to block . Otherwise the user expresses interest in specific content presented in the streaming banner yes branch of block and the given mobile device receives and displays the fulfilled action request at a block . Additional details regarding the response to the user action on the banner is described above with respect to block of .

In this manner determination and configuration of streaming banners including information about one or more items content are disclosed herein. The streaming banner displayed on a pre determined portion of a screen of a mobile device serves informational as well as commercial purposes. Provision of a streaming banner for a given mobile device is triggered by either a user activity on the mobile device and or a system set condition. In response to the trigger each of the items content represented in the streaming banner is selected in accordance with the trigger condition and or initial item content identification source s . In the case of the items content comprising apps one or more specific apps is selected as follows to be announced promoted recommended marketed offered for sale or otherwise included in the streaming banner 1 select app s downloaded by other users having user profiles similar to the user profile of a user of the given mobile device 2 select app s identified downloaded by the user s contacts friends or those in the user s social network 3 select app s matching user profile preferences or latest user activity and or 4 select app s that are already designated by an items content store e.g. new apps .

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. liquid crystal display LCD organic light emitting diode OLED display touch screen or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a physical keyboard a virtual keyboard using software a cursor control device or input sensor e.g. a mouse a trackpad a trackball a sensor or reader a machine readable information reader bar code reader a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device or transceiver .

It will be appreciated that for clarity purposes the above description describes some embodiments with reference to different functional units or processors. However it will be apparent that any suitable distribution of functionality between different functional units processors or domains may be used without detracting from the invention. For example functionality illustrated to be performed by separate processors or controllers may be performed by the same processor or controller. Hence references to specific functional units are only to be seen as references to suitable means for providing the described functionality rather than indicative of a strict logical or physical structure or organization.

Certain embodiments described herein may be implemented as logic or a number of modules engines components or mechanisms. A module engine logic component or mechanism collectively referred to as a module may be a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and configured or arranged in a certain manner. In certain example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more components of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion or firmware note that software and firmware can generally be used interchangeably herein as is known by a skilled artisan as a module that operates to perform certain operations described herein.

In various embodiments a module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. within a special purpose processor application specific integrated circuit ASIC or array to perform certain operations. A module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software or firmware to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that a decision to implement a module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by for example cost time energy usage and package size considerations.

Accordingly the term module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which modules or components are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the modules or components need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the modules or components comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure the processor to constitute a particular module at one instance of time and to constitute a different module at a different instance of time.

Modules can provide information to and receive information from other modules. Accordingly the described modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiples of such modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the modules. In embodiments in which multiple modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple modules have access. For example one module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .
