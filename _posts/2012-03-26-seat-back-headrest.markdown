This application is a division of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 946 109 filed Nov. 15 2010 and co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 009 938 filed Jan. 20 2011 which is a continuation in part of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 946 109 and claims priority benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 547 882 filed Oct. 27 2011 all for a SEAT BACK HEADREST by Sami Maassarani the contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In order to alleviate the neck strain associated with a person trying to sleep while seated in a seat such as a vehicle seat airplane seat train seat etc. and maintaining his or her head in a generally upright vertical position a variety of different headrests have been devised for supporting a portion of the user s head such as each side cheek or in a fully face encircling manner.

Maintaining a sleeping person s head in a generally upright position while the person is sleeping in a seat is particularly important from a safety standpoint for small children who frequently fall asleep while riding in a vehicle airplane or train.

The various devised headrests are either designed as part of the vehicle head restraint or are portable and removably attachable to the seatback for deployment and use. However the previously devised headrests are either cumbersome or unsightly to deploy and attach to a seat back or do not have easily adjustable positions to enable use of the headrest with different sized individuals or with children as the children grow.

It would be desirable to provide a seat headrest which overcomes these difficulties and provides ease of attachment and ease of adjustability.

A seat back headrest is mountable on a seat back for supporting a portion of a user s head when seated in the seat.

In one aspect a combination of a vehicle seat and a headrest includes a vehicle seat having a generally upright seat back with an upper end opposed side edges a front surface and a back surface and a headrest. At least one bore extending into the seat back from an open end at the front surface of the seat back a portable headrest having a connector releasibly mountable in the bore in the seat back and a cushion carried by the connector for weight bearing support of a seat user s head.

In a modification of this aspect the at least one bore includes two generally horizontally spaced bores formed in the seat back each extending from an open end at the front surface of the seat back. Another connector removable in one of the bores in the seat back and a cushion carried by the connectors for weight bearing support of a seat user s head.

A separate cushion may be coupled to each connector. Alternately a single cushion may be coupled to both connectors.

The connector may include a hinge having first and second pivotally connected hinge portions the first hinge portion fixedly coupled to the connector and the second hinge portion coupled to the cushion and pivotally movable from a first position relative to the first hinge member when the mounting member is in the first position on the seat back and a second position relative to the first hinge portion when the mounting member is in the inverted second position to deploy the cushion in one of two angular positions relative to the seat back.

Referring now to the drawing and to in particular there is depicted one aspect of a headrest usable on a seat . By way of example only the seat may be any type of seat such as vehicle seat an airplane seat a train seat or a seat used in an office work space or home. The seat has a seat back and a seat bottom . Depending upon the application the seat back may be rigidly fixed to the seat bottom or may be pivotal from in a more generally upright position shown in to an angled position over the seat bottom .

For purposes of the following description the seat back includes a top edge opposed side edges and a front surface and an opposed rear surface .

One aspect of a headrest is shown in . The headrest is designed as a portable headrest for removable mounting over the top edge of the seat back . The headrest includes one or a pair of mounting members and . The mounting members and are configured for releasable mounting over the top edge of the seat back and are in substantial contact with the front surface and the rear surface of the seat back .

By way of example only each mounting member and is identically constructed of a front seat engagement member in a form of a planar plate and a like rear seat engagement member also in the form of an enlarged planar plate. The large surface area of the front and rear plates and provides a secure mounting for the headrest on the seat back .

A strap is fixed to and interconnects the front and rear plates and . The strap may be a single strip of plastic or metal material which is integrally formed with or attached to the front and rear plates and .

Alternately the strap may be formed of two members one attached to each of the front and rear plates and and telescopingly engaged in a tight friction fit. This enables the strap to be telescopingly elongated or reduced in length so as to vary the spacing between the front and rear plates and to enable the mounting members or to be securely affixed to any thickness of the seatback .

For purposes of the following description of the use and operation of the headrest in the first mounting or use position where the mounting members and are securely mounted over the top edge of the seat back the front member has an upper edge and a lower edge . Similarly the rear plate or member of each mounting member and has an upper edge and a lower edge .

As shown more clearly in the upper edges and of the front and rear plates and extend above the strap on the top edge of the seat back . In the illustrated mounting position shown in the lower edges and of the front and rear plates and extend below the top edge of the seat back .

A cushion connector is affixed to the front plate of each mounting member and . In one aspect the cushion connector includes a wire rod formed of plastic metal etc. which extends into or is otherwise affixed to one end of a cushion .

A hinge is formed as part of the cushion connector . The hinge includes first and second hinge portions or leaves and . The first hinge portion or leaf is fixedly attached by adhesive integral molding fasteners to the front plate etc. It will be understood that the first hinge leaf may also constitute part of the front plate itself. As is conventional the first hinge leaf includes a plurality of cylindrical hollow spaced sleeves adapted for receiving a hinge pin .

The second hinge leaf also includes a plurality of cylindrical sleeves which are linearly spaced apart and intermeshed with the sleeves on the first hinge leaf for receiving the pivot pin therethrough and forming a pivot axis which extends in a substantially horizontal orientation when the headrest is mounted over the top edge of the seat back .

In this aspect as shown in the rod is fixedly attached to one of the cylindrical sleeves on the second hinge leaf such as the central most sleeve . This causes the rod to pivot with movement of the second hinge leaf as described hereafter.

A stop shown in is fixed at one end to the second hinge leaf and extends to an opposite free end adapted to abut one of the cylindrical sleeves on the first hinge leaf to limit the open pivotal movement of the second hinge leaf with respect to the first hinge leaf to a predetermined angle as shown in .

For smaller height individuals such as children the headrest can be inverted 180 from the mounting position shown in by flipping the mounting members and end over end until the mounting member is in the prior position of the mounting member on the seat back as shown in . When the mounting members and are reengaged with the top edge of the seat back the weight of the cushion will cause a second hinge leaf to pivot about the pivot pin until it is disposed in close abutment or engagement with the first hinge leaf . This collapsing movement of the hinge causes the rod and the cushions to pivot in a downward direction relative to the seat back to a smaller acute angle with respect to the seat back . This lowers the sides and front of the portions of the cushion for shorter height individuals.

The rod is formed as a continuous member with freely movable second end portions and which are formed with interconnecting means and in the form of interlocking hooks or loops. This arrangement allows the enlarged pads and to be engaged with the front surface of the seat back and then the free ends and of the rod looped around the head restraint or upper portion of the seat back and interlocked to secure the headrest on the seat .

If the rod if formed of a flexible material such a flexible metal not only can the angle of the end of the end portions of the rod be changed to vary the angle of the cushion relative to the seat back but the free end portions and of the rod may also be bent to any desired shape to fit the headrest securely about the upper portion of any size or shape seat back .

Alternately the cushion and may have generally planar or slightly curved side members without a central portion so as to be capable of supporting only the sides of a user s head.

The cushions or may be formed in any conventional manner depending upon the construction and use of the seat. Foam or other soft compliant materials may be used for the entire cushion or an internal core of the cushion. Decorative outer covers formed of leather plastic fabric and complimentary to materials used in conventional vehicle airplane train or home seats maybe employed.

Referring now to there is depicted another aspect of a headrest . In this aspect the mounting member and the cushion connector are formed of a single pre shaped or bent rod . The rod can be made of any suitable material such as moldable plastic as well as plastic covered metal etc. The rod is bent or pre shaped into a mounting portion including first and second mounting legs and configured to respectively engage the front surface and the rear surface of the seat back . Each mounting leg and is formed of two adjacent bent portions of the rod for stability and adjustability. An end portion of the rod is disposed within a cushion for supporting the cushion on the mounting rod .

As in previous aspects of the present headrest the cushion may take a variety of shapes including straight slightly curved or the J shape shown by way of example in .

An enlarged pad or plate is fixed to the front mounting leg to provide an enlarged surface area for securely supporting the headrest on the seat back . Depending on the materials used to form the rod and the pad welding adhesive fasteners or other joining techniques may be employed to fixedly join the pad to the front mounting leg .

Where the rod is made of a flexible metal the front end portion of the rod due to angled two part form of the front mounting leg maybe easily bent in a downward position to lower the angle of the cushion relative to the seat back as by reference number shown in phantom in . This enables the position if the cushion to be adjusted to suit the height of the user of the seat.

Another aspect of the wire connector is shown in . In this aspect of the headrest the second leg shown in is replaced by an initially shaped straight portion with the connector portion . A form having an internal bore size to slidably fit the form over the end of of the rod is provided with an edge A.

In use with the end portion of the rod extending perpendicularly away from the rear surface of the seat back which has a smaller thickness than the seat back shown in the form is slid over the end portion of the rod until the end A of the form abuts the rear edge of the seat back . The form is then used to bend the free end of the rod in a downward position until the form and or the free end of the rod is bent at a downward extending angle relative to the connector portion of the rod a lane over the top edge of the seat back to snugly conform the rod to the shape and thickness of the seat back .

Another modification to the wire connector is shown in . In this aspect of the headrest the rod also has the straight rearward extending portion . Rather than bending the rod around the top edge of the seat back a clip is provided. The clip is formed of a spring material such as a spring steel or plastic and has a V shape formed with first and second angularly disposed legs and . Coaxially aligned apertures A and A are respectively formed in the legs and and are sized to fit over the free end of the rod .

In use after the rod is mounted over the top edge of the seat back the apertures A and of the clip are slid over the free end of the rod by bending the legs and of the clip together. This coaxially aligns the apertures A and A to allow easy sliding insertion of the clip over the free end of the rod . The clip is slid along the length of the free end until the leg contacts the rear surface of the seat back . The force holding the end of the legs and is then released which the causes the legs and to spring outward to the position shown in . This moves the apertures A and A out of coaxially alignment and brings edges of the legs and surrounding the apertures A and A into friction contact with the end portion of the rod to forcibly hold the clip on the rod and thereby the entire mounting member and cushion on the seat back .

This arrangement allows easy adaptability of the mounting member to any thickness seat back. The free end extending rearward of the clip can be covered a cushion such as the form shown in . Alternately user of the mounting member with the clip can be reserved for seat backs in the rear seat of a vehicle such as the rear most seat of a mini van or SUV or the rear seat of a vehicle having only front and rear seats.

The rod is formed as a continuous member with freely movable second end portions and which are formed with interconnecting means and in the form of interlocking hooks or loops. This arrangement allows the enlarged pads and to be engaged with the front surface of the seat back and then the free ends and of the rod looped around the head restraint or upper portion of the seat back and interlocked to secure the headrest on the seat .

If the rod is formed of a flexible material such as a flexible metal not only can the angle of the end portions of the rod be changed to vary the angle of the cushion relative to the seat back but the free end portions and of the rod may also be bent to any desired shape to fit the headrest securely about the upper portion of any size or shape seat back .

Another aspect of a headrest is shown in in which the headrest is integrally coupled to the seat back .

In this aspect the seat back is formed with a hollow bore which maybe contained within a rigid cylinder fixedly mounted in the upper portion of the seat back. The bore in the cylinder has an open end through the front surface of the seat back .

The hinge members and rods and of the headrest shown in are also employed in this aspect of the headrest. An additional rod extends from a first hinge leaf and is removably insertable into the bore in the cylinder mounted in the seat back . The rods and support a cushion . The cushion is shown by example only as being a continuous semi circular cushion extending between each of the rods and . It will be understood that each rod and may support a separate cushion such as the straight or J shaped cushions shown in .

When the rods coupled to the hinge members are inserted into the bores in the seat back in a first orientation shown in the second hinge leaf will pivot to an open position angularly spaced from the first hinge leaf to orient the cushion in a substantially horizontal position relative to the seat back .

The rods may be removed from the bores in the seat back and the entire head rest inverted as shown in before the rods are reinserted into the bores of the seat back . In this orientation the second hinge leaf pivots into close proximity to or in contact with the first hinge leaf thereby dropping the cushion to a smaller acute angle relative to the seat back then when the mounting members are in the opposite position shown in .

The varying angular position of the cushion may also be achieved by employing two pairs of cylindrical members and as shown in on one side or both sides of the upper portion of the seat back . The second cylindrical sleeve is angled at a more downward angle then the generally horizontally disposed sleeve . The rods which do not have the hinge members may then be simply inserted into the bores in either cylindrical sleeve or to place the cushion at the desired one of two angular positions relative to the seat back to accommodate the height and size of the user of the seat.

Another aspect of a headrest is shown in . In this aspect a seat back of a seat has a recess formed along the upper portion of the seat back and extending inward into the seat back from the front surface . The recess may have an inverted U shape to accommodate a continuous semicircular U shaped cushion shown by way of example in . In the case of only a single side cushion or a pair of separate side cushions which are independently movable relative to other the recess would have a shape complimentary to the shape of the cushions employed in the headrest.

The cushion is formed with a pair of opposed side arms and which interconnected at one end by an end segment . A pivot pin and is mounted in the end of each arm and respectively. A metal sleeve may be mounted in the end of each of the cushion arms and to provide an easily slidable connection to the pivot pins and . The pins and are fixedly mounted within the internal structure of the seat back and form co axial pivot axes about which the entire cushion can pivot.

The pivot connections provided by the pivot pins and on the arms and of the cushion enable the cushion to be pivoted from a first position shown in solid in in which the cushion is completely seated in the recess in the seat back thereby forming an integral part of the seat back . The cushion can be easily pivoted by hand force from the retracted position shown in to a first deployed position shown in phantom by reference number in . Although this first deployed position of the cushion is shown as being substantially perpendicular to the seat back or parallel to the seat bottom it will be understood that the bottom edge of the recess can be angled downward a greater amount to allow further pivoting movement of the cushion below the horizontal to a more angled position relative to the seat back .

Alternately an electric motor can be coupled to the side arms or and mounted in the seat back or seat bottom for automatically extending and retracting the cushion through activation of a remotely located control switch.

In a modification to this design shown in a detent mechanism is mounted in the seat back and the cushion to provide discrete angular positioning of the cushion in one of several distinct deployed positions. The detent mechanism includes a spring based pin projecting from the seat back into the recess . A cylindrical disc is mounted in each cushion arm end around the pivot pins and and carries a plurality of circumferentially spaced detent recesses labeled A B and C. When the cushion is rotated so that the pin engages detent recess A the cushion will be in the full retracted position within the recess . However hand force on the cushion can easily pull the cushion from the recess and rotate the cushion until the pin engages detent recess B. This defines the first angular deployed position of the cushion . Further downward force on the cushion will cause the cushion to rotate about the pivot pins and until the detent pin engages the detent recess C to provide a lower angled deployed position C of the cushion .

Further it is possible to connect extensible and retractable devices such as electric motor driven linear rods or extensible and retractable fluid operated cylinders to the pivot connections at the ends of the side arms and of the cushion . The extensible and retractable devices which are operated simultaneously from a vehicle occupant activated switch similar to switches used to control the up and down movement of the vehicle windows enable the entire cushion after the cushion has been moved at least partially out of the recess in the seat back to be elevated from the lowermost position shown in to a more elevated or vertical spaced position so as to selectively position the entire cushion at the desired height for the particular size occupant of the seat .

The extensible and retractable mechanisms are operated in a reverse manner to lower the pivot connections at each of the side arms and back to the lowermost position shown in prior to pivotal movement of the cushion in an upward direction into the recess in the seatback .

Referring now to there is depicted another aspect of a headrest . As with previous aspects of the present headrest the headrest includes a cushion depicted has having a generally U shape formed of a central end portion which transitions into angularly disposed side cheek portions and . The headrest may alternately be in the form of a single side cheek which may have a linear shape a slightly curved or arcuate shape or a J shape having a side cheek portion and a partial front end which may extend into close proximity or contact with the end of a mirror image J shaped side check portion mounted in the seat back . A single J shaped cushion may be employed all by itself on one lateral side of the seat back .

A recess is formed in the seat back opening from an open end at the front surface of the seat back . The recess has a depth suited for completely receiving the entire depth of the end portion of the cushion when the cushion is in the fully retracted position.

Apertures and are formed on opposite sides of the back surface of the recess . The apertures and and open either into the interior of the seat back or into the interior of receptacles and respectively fixed within the interior of the seat back generally within the cushion material such as foam for example used to fill the interior of the seat back .

It will be understood that in a case of a headrest in the form of a single side cheek cushion only one aperture or is formed in the seat back adjacent either side edge of the seatback .

By way of example only a slide mechanism is mounted in the seat back in the form of one or multiple box members with two box members and provided by example on each side of the headrest . The box members may have any suitable cross section such as square rectangular circular etc. Each box member has a one or more first end flange which extend laterally outward from the longitudinal center line of the box member and opposed second flanges which extend inward into the interior of the box member. The box member has a hollow interior size for receiving the second box member or in the case of the use of only the single box member the end of one of the side cushion portions or of the cushion . The box member has a sidewall which extends between the flanges and .

The flanges and may comprise a pair of two laterally opposed flanges or a continuous or discontinuous series of multiple flanges in the case of a square cross section box member or . The function of the flanges and is to control the extension and retraction position of the box members and as described hereafter.

The second box member has shape complimentary to the shape of the first box member but with a smaller diameter or width dimension so that the flange or flanges at a first end of the second box member nest within the interior of the first box member and are engageable with the second flanges on the first box member when the first and second box members and are pulled to their extended position as shown in .

The second box member includes a second flange or flanges at an opposite end of a sidewall which define an opening through which an enlarged end of the side cushion or nests.

In use the headrest will assume to be in the retracted non use position shown in . In this position the front end portion of the cushion fits substantially flush with the front surface of the seatback when the end portion nests within the recess opening from the front surface of the seatback . This provides a substantially flush front surface for the seat back when the headrest is not in use.

When use of the headrest is desired a user merely grasps the end portion and pulls the end portion outward away from the front surface of the seat back . Although extension to the fully extended position shown in is the usual end position it will be understood that the headrest may be extended to any intermediate position to fit the size of the person seated in the seat.

During the extension sliding motion the flanges and of the box members and move from the nested position shown in . The initial outward force on the end portion cause the side cushions and of the headrest and their associated enlarged ends to slide within the interior of the second box member until the outer portions of the enlarged ends engage the second flanges on the second box member .

Continued outward force on the end portion of the headrest then causes the second box member to slide through the interior of the first box member from the nested retracted position shown in until the opposite end flanges engage the second end flanges of the first box . Continued extension movement then pulls the first box member from the nested position shown in to a fully extended position limited by engagement of the first end flanges with a rigid plate or structure formed within the seat back . This position shown in defines the fully extended use position of the headrest .

In the fully extended position shown in the cushion and the pairs of opposed box members and forms a opening in front of the front surface of the seat back suitable for receiving a least a portion of a user s head. The shape of the cushion and the box members and surrounds the entire user s head so as to provide a cushion regardless of the position of the user s head.

When use of the headrest is no longer desired the user simply exerts a pushing force on the end portion of the cushion which causes a reverse operation in which the ends of the side cushions and slide through the interior of the second box member until the laterally extending end portion of the headrest engages the flanges on the second box member . This engagement and continued inward pushing force by the user then causes the second box member to move with the headrest through the interior of the first box member until the end portion of the cushion engages the second flanges on the first box member . Continued inward pushing force then causes the first box member to retract through the apertures or in the seatback . The inward pushing force is exerted on the headrest until the front end portion nests completely within the recess .

Referring now to there is depicted another aspect of a headrest which is extensibly mounted within the seat back

As in previous aspects the headrest is shown as being in the form of a continuous U shaped member only by way of example as having cushion with a portion and two side portions and . The headrest may also be in the form of a single side cheek cushion of linear slightly curved or J shaped or two side cushions of like mirror image shape.

The seat back has a configuration similar to that shown in and includes the recess formed in the upper portion of the front surface of the seat back . Opposed apertures only one of which is shown in are formed within the interior of the recess and open to the interior of the seat back .

In this aspect the headrest extensibly and retractably moves on a slide mechanism denoted generally by reference number . The slide mechanism includes a lower track and a slidably engaged upper slider which is fixedly connected to and supports the end portion of the sides and of the cushion .

As shown in detail in the lower track which may be formed of rigid high strength plastic metal or other suitable seat construction materials has a bottom a pair of opposed sides and and inward extending upper flanges and which are formed as an integral part or extension of the respective sides and . The inner edges and of the upper flanges and respectively are spaced apart to form a slot which runs longitudinally along the entire length of the upper flanges and .

The bottom includes an extension which projects from one end of the sides and and the inward extending flanges and .

A recess is formed substantially over the entire length of the bottom of the lower track . The recess is defined by a slot like aperture formed by upper inward extending flanges and . The inner ends of the upper flanges and are spaced apart to define a slot which runs along the length of the recess .

The upper slider is slidably disposed within the interior of the sidewalls and and the inward extending flanges and of the lower track . A portion of the upper slider projects through the slot formed between the inner spaced edges and of the flanges and .

As shown in the upper slider includes a central stem from which projects a pair of longitudinally and oppositely extending upper flanges or lobes and and an opposed pair of longitudinally and oppositely or outwardly extending lower flanges or lobes and . The lower flanges and slide within the opening extending above the bottom and within the inner surface of the sides and and below the upper flanges and of the lower track as shown in . A portion of the central stem projects through the slot formed between inner edges and of the upper flanges and to position the upper flanges and above the upper flanges and of the lower track .

The dimensions of the lower track and the slider are selected to provide a snug but freely movable fit. A friction fit maybe provided to enable the upper slider to be pulled out any desired distance relative to the lower track and remain in a relatively stable position.

When the headrest in the fully retracted position the front end portion of the headrest will be substantially disposed within the recess and substantially flush with the front surface of the seatback .

To use the headrest the user grasps the end portion and pulls outward away from the seat back . This outward movement causes the upper slider to slide along the lower track until the headrest reaches the fully extended position shown in . It will be understood that if a friction fit is employed between the upper slider and the lower track the headrest may be disposed in any intermediate position between the full retracted position and the fully extended position.

An internal stop not shown may be coupled between the upper slider and the lower track to limit sliding movement of the upper slider in a forward direction relative to the lower track to prevent the headrest from being pulled completely out of the slide mechanism .

A reverse operation using an inward pushing force causes the headrest to move to the fully retracted position within the recess in the seat back .

The modification utilizes the recess formed in the lower track and a pivot member such as a hinge formed of a first hinge leaf and a second hinge leaf pivotally connected by a pivot pin . The first leaf is fixedly connected to the bottom surface of the upper slider . The second hinge leaf slides within the recess and is captured within the recess by the inward facing flanges and in the lower track .

In use with the cushion in the fully retracted position within the seat back the first and second hinge leaves and will be in a collapsed position either in contact with each other or in non contacting but overlaying position. This allows normal sliding movement of the upper track and the headrest along the length of the lower track between the retracted or extended positions.

After the headrest has been pulled to the fully extended position as shown in a downward force can be exerted on the end of the cushion . This downward force causes the hinge leaves and to separate with the first hinge leaf pivoting away from the second hinge leaf which is held captured within the recess in the lower track . This causes the entire headrest to pivot about the hinge pin bringing the front end portion of the cushion at a downward angle and at a lower position relative to the top edge of the seat back to accommodate shorter height seat users especially smaller children.

To retract the headrest the headrest is first pivoted upward bringing the upper slider in line with the lower track . The upper slider and the headrest are then slid inward along the length of the lower track as described above until the fully retracted position is reached.

Another aspect of a headrest is shown in . The headrest is similar to the headrest shown in . The headrest can be constructed as a single one piece headrest including two pairs of mounting members and each of which includes a cross piece spanning the top edge of the seatback . The front mounting plates of each pair of mounting plates and carry the hinges with the first hinge leaf fixed to the mounting plate and the second hinge leaf carrying the rod attached to the cushion . As in the headrest the pairs of mounting members and maybe separate with each carrying a single linear curved or J shaped cushion or a single cushion such as cushion may extend between the hinges on the front mounting plates of each pair of mounting plates and .

As shown in the hinge is configured to allow pivotal movement of the cushion from a first angular use position supporting the head such as the side of the cheek chin or forehead of a person seated within the seat to a second non used position shown in phantom in by reference number . The second position places the cushion in a substantially vertically extending position relative to the seatback . This allows easy ingress and egress of the person to and from the seat. Once the person is seated in the seat the cushion may be easily pivoted from the non use position to the first use position shown in solid in .

A similar hinged pivotal connection is provided for the headrest shown in . The headrest is similar to the headrest shown in in which the hinge is connected to a rod which is insertable into a bore formed in the front surface of the seat . In this headrest construction the hinge in a first use position in which the cushion is angularly disposed with respect to the front surface of the seatback disposes the cushion . As in the headrest shown in the headrest may also be configured as a single side headrest in which the cushion has a linear curved or J shape for supporting only one side of a user s head or formed of two separate plug in hinge assemblies which are interconnected by a single U shaped cushion .

In either construction the hinge or hinges allow the cushion to be pivoted from the first use position shown in solid in to a second non use position shown in phantom in . In the second non use position the cushion is disposed at a substantially vertically extending orientation with respect to the front surface of the seatback. This allows easy ingress and egress of a person to and from the seat. When the person is seated within the seat the cushion maybe pivoted from the second non use position back to the first use shown in solid in to support a portion of the head the user.

Referring now to there is depicted another aspect of a headrest which mounts in the bores and extending inward into the seat from the top edge of the seatback . The bores and are normally used to receive the pair of posts on the standard seat headrest cushion which mounts on the top edge of the seatback for collision safety of the seat occupant. The headrest is illustrated by example only as using the cushion in the front plates of the mounts and shown in . It will be understood that the cushion and shown in may also be employed with the single mounting plate for one side support of a user s head.

The mounting plates are fixedly secured together into an integral assembly by means of a cross member which extends laterally between and is secured to each mounting plate by suitable means such as mechanical fasteners adhesive welding etc.

A pair of posts and with it being understood that only a single post or is used with a single side cushion such as the cushion shown in are fixed to and extend downward from the cross member . The post and are designed to fit into and removably slide into the bores and extending inward from an opening in the top surface of the seatback . As mentioned above the bores and are those used with the conventional seat headrest.

The cushion can be secured to the mounting plates in a permanent angular position such as that shown in which is depicted by way of example only or other angular configurations essentially at smaller acute angles with respect to the front surface of the seatback . Alternately the cushion may be connected to the mounting plates by a pivotal connection including the hinges as described in previous aspects of the present headrest. The hinges allow pivotal movement of the cushion from the first use position shown in to a non use position similar to the non use positions of the cushions shown in in which the cushion extends in a substantially vertical position relative to the front surface of the seatback .

In use the conventional seat headrest is removed and the post and of the headrest inserted into the bores and of the seatback . The cushion is moved to the desired first or second positions.

The headrest can remain in position in the seatback for as long as user desires to employ the headrest . When use of the headrest is no longer desired the entire headrest can be removed from the seatback in the standard seat headrest reinserted into the bores and .

Referring now to there is depicted another aspect of a headrest . In this aspect the headrest has a shape substantially complimentary to the shape of the outer edge of a conventional vehicle seat head restraint .

The head restraint typically includes an inner support from which one or two posts and extend for removably insertion into the open ends and of sleeves or bores formed in the upper edge of the seatback . A head restraint body is formed about the head restraint pad by foam padding etc. to fixedly attach the head restraint body to the pad .

In the illustrated example of the head restraint the head restraint body has a smoothly curved generally U shaped outer edge. It will be understood that the outer edge of the head restraint body may take other shapes such as a rectangular shape for example.

The cushion which is formed in the same manner as the previously described cushions has a shape substantially complimentary to the shape of the outer edge of the head restraint body or a generally U shape in the present example of the head restraint .

The cushion includes a pair of opposed side legs and which extend from respective lower ends in a smoothly curved arc through an interconnecting central end portion . It will be understood that the lower end portions of the sides of the outer edge of the head restraint body and the side legs and of the cushion may have an initial straight portion extending from the lower ends before smoothly curving and transitioning into the arcuate central end portion .

In the present aspect the cushion is movably coupled to the head restraint body for angular positioning between a first non use position shown in in which the cushion substantially overlays the outer edge of the head restraint body to any of a plurality of selected use positions only one of which is shown in phantom in .

The pivotal action is provided by a pair of cushion connectors or pivots and located adjacent the lower ends of the side legs and of the cushion and the lower ends of the opposed sides of the head restraint body .

One example of the pivot is shown in . A pair of receivers or pin mounts and is respectively fixed in the head restraint body and the side leg of the cushion . The mounts and maybe adhesively or otherwise fixedly mounted in the cushion of the head restraint .

A pivot pin is mounted in co axial bores formed in the mounts and . The pin maybe a solid pin or the pin maybe formed of outwardly spring biased telescopingly coupled sections to enable the pin to be compressed to a smaller length for mounting in the receivers and on opposite sides of the head restraint and the cushion .

The cushion can be angularly pivoted from the first position shown in solid in to any desired stationary use position such as the one shown in phantom in by means of a tight friction fit between the lower inner portions of the side legs and of the cushion and the adjoining portions of the outer edge of the head restraint body . Alternately the mounts and and to the pivot pin in the pivots and may be provided with a plurality of angularly spaced detents as previously described to provide one or more angularly spaced use positions for the cushion .

Referring now to the drawing and to in particular there is depicted one aspect of a headrest usable on a vehicle seat .

The headrest includes a seat mount member having a first seat mount member portion a second seat mount member portion and cushion connectors . The seat mount member portions and are substantially identical in that each includes a mounting leg portion and a seat back engagement portion and respectively.

The first and second seat mount member portions and and the cushion connectors are formed by way of example only as a continuous flexible rod . The rod can be formed of a spring metal with the portions of the rod disposed exteriorly of the cushion coated with a soft cover material such as a soft plastic.

The rod may also be formed of two separate portions each including a seat back mounting member portion and a cushion connector portion. In this example the cushion interconnects the cushion connectors on each of the separate rods.

The rod is formed as a continuous member with freely movable end portions and which are formed with interconnecting means and in the form of an interlocking hook formed as a U shape in the end of the rod and at least one loop formed by bending the wire into a circular or other closed shape adjacent the end . The hook is insertable through the loop to interlock and fixedly hold the ends and of the rod securely about a seat headrest or the upper surface of the seat.

By way of example at least one additional loop is formed in the rod adjacent to the loop to provide for adjustability in securing the ends and of the rod tightly about the seat headrest .

From the free ends and of the rod the rod is bent at an angle typically approximately 90 into legs and which are configured for engagement with a top edge of the seat back . The legs and maybe formed with a linear shape or a slightly arcuate concave shape for secure engagement with the shape of the top edge of the seat back .

The legs and transition into the seat back engagement portions or pads and which by example only are in the form of enlarged pads and . Each of the pads and has a first leg angularly disposed relative to the leg or . The first leg may be disposed at an obtuse or greater than 90 angle relative to the corresponding leg or to orient the cushion connectors and the cushion at the desired forward facing angle relative to the front surface of the seat back as described hereafter.

The first leg transitions into a first end leg then a second leg spaced from the first leg and then a second end leg spaced from the first end leg . The legs and may be formed into the illustrated rectangular shape or any other shape such as circular or polygonal to form an enlarged pad like surface area for secure engagement with the seat back to securely support the headrest on the seat back .

The opposite ends of the second legs of each of the pads and again curve outward from the pads and into the cushion connectors which project out of the opposite ends and of the cushion .

As shown in the pads and project at an angle from the mounting member legs so as to dispose the cushion connectors and the attached cushion in a forward facing direction relative to the front surface of the seatback so that the cushion encircles the upper portion of a user s head seated in the seat. For use of headrest with smaller children it is possible to bend the rod at the juncture of the pads and and the mounting legs and so that the angle of the pads and relative to the legs and is at a smaller obtuse angle. This has the effect of changing the angle of the cushion connector and the attached cushion so that the cushion is disposed at a smaller acute angle relative to the front surface of the seatback .

Alternately the angle of the cushion connectors relative to the loop and may also be changed by bending the rod at the juncture of each cushion connector and the respective pad and in a direction to decrease the angle between the pads and and the cushion connector . This has the same effect as the alternate bending location described above to decrease the angle of the cushion relative to the front surface of the seatback for use with shorter children.

By example the second leg of each of the pads and is disposed under the first leg of each pad or . This provides additional support for the entire headrest when mounted on the seat back as well as a measure of flexibility for the cushion to conform to the position of the user s head when the user s head engages the cushion such as when the user is asleep. However the above described overlap of the legs of the pads and enables the first legs of each loop and to retain the adjacent cushion connector in a relatively stable position when the headrest is mounted on the seat back .

As shown in the rod extends continuously through the cushion . This enables the cushion to be molded or otherwise formed by vacuum forming for example from a self skinning plastic resin or plastic material about the cushion supporting portion of the rod in a mold to form the cushion in the desired generally tubular cross section shape illustrated by way of example only in .

In use with the hook disengaged from the loops or the headrest is mounted over the upper edge of a seat back until the legs and lay in contact with the top edge of the seat back . In this position the enlarged pads and are disposed in contact with the upper portion of the front surface of the seat back and the cushion is disposed forward of and at a slightly downward extending angle relative to the pads and . The hook is then engaged with an appropriate one of the loops and to tightly secure the free ends and of the rod about the car seat headrest or about the upper portion of the seat back .

It should be noted that the headrest can be installed prior to the user entering the seat or after the user is seated in the seat .

Referring now to there is depicted another aspect of a headrest . In this aspect the headrest has a shape substantially complimentary to the shape of the outer edge of a conventional child car seat or child car booster seat .

The child car seat typically includes a head support area from which two side wings and extend. The upper edge of each side wing and or the entire rear surface of the child car seat may be formed of a rigid material such as a hard plastic. An upper or top edge is formed in the back of the child car seat between the upper ends of the side wings and . Portions or the entire inner surface of the child car seat may be covered with a soft resilient pad for child comfort.

By way of example only the upper edge of the side wings and or the outer shell of the child car seat which provides support for the side pads and the top edge of the back of the child seat form a generally U shaped continuous outer edge. It will be understood that the outer edge of the child seat may take other shapes such as any polygonal shape for example.

The cushion which is formed in the same manner as the previously described cushions has a shape substantially complimentary to the shape of the outer edge of the child car seat or a generally U shape in the present example of the child car seat .

The cushion includes a pair of opposed side legs and which extend from respective free ends in a smoothly curved arc through an interconnecting central end portion . It will be understood that the lower end portions of the sides of the outer edge of the child seat and the side legs and of the cushion may have an initial straight portion extending from the ends before smoothly curving and transitioning into the arcuate central end portion .

In this aspect the cushion is movably coupled to the child seat for angular positioning between a first non use position shown phantom in in which the cushion substantially overlays or fits within the outer top edge of the child seat and at least one or a plurality of selected use positions only one of which is shown in solid in .

The pivotal action of the cushion is provided by a pair of cushion connectors or pivots and located adjacent the lower ends of the side legs and of the cushion and the opposed sides of the child car seat .

One example of the pivot is shown in . A pair of receivers or pin mounts and is respectively fixed in the child car seat and the side leg of the cushion . The mounts and maybe adhesively or otherwise fixedly mounted in the cushion and the child car seat .

A pivot pin is mounted in co axial bores formed in the mounts and . The pin maybe a solid pin or the pin maybe formed of outwardly spring biased telescopingly coupled sections to enable the pin to be compressed to a smaller length for mounting in the receivers and on opposite sides of the child car seat and the cushion .

The cushion can be angularly pivoted from the first position shown in phantom in to any desired stationary use position such as the one shown in solid in by means of a tight friction fit between the lower inner portions of the side legs and of the cushion and the adjoining portions of the outer edge of the child car seat . Alternately the mounts and to the pivot pin in the pivots and may be provided with a plurality of angularly spaced detents to provide one or more angularly spaced discrete use positions for the cushion .

In use the cushion or headrest is pivoted to the first non use position overlaying the rear portion of the top edge of the child seat . After the child is inserted into the child car seat the headrest is pivoted about the pivots and to the desired angular position where the cushion is situated forward of and encircling the child s face. This positions the cushion for engagement with and to support a portion of the child s head such as the forehead and or side or cheek portion of the child s head when the child s head slumps forward during sleep.
