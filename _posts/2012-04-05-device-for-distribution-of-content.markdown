Another aspect of the specification provides a computer program product comprising a computer usable medium having a computer readable program code adapted to be executed to implement a method for receiving at a server from a first computing device via a communication interface a request to provide content installed at a plurality of associated computing devices the plurality of associated computing devices including the first computing device retrieving from a content database a list of the content installed at each of the plurality of associated computing devices and an indication of whether the content is available for installation at others of the plurality of associated computing devices by comparing respective device attributes of each of the plurality of associated computing devices with respective content attributes associated with the content transmitting to the first computing device via the communication interface an indication of the list in response receiving from a first computing device via the communication interface selection data indicative of a subset of the content on the list selected for installation at respective selected devices of the plurality of associated computing devices and causing respective installation data for installing respective selected content to be pushed to the respective selected devices.

Content that can be distributed herein can include but is not limited to applications e.g. apps games audio content video content and the like.

Server is enabled for accessing a database storing content installation data interchangeably referred to hereafter as installation data . As will be explained below each set of content installation data is associated with content attribute data as represented by the dotted line between each of installation data and attribute data in . Each set of attribute data comprises data indicative of a platform that content associated with installation data requires in order to install and run properly on a given device. For example associated content can require a given operating system screen size data connection and or require specific functionality e.g. GPS Global Positioning System LBS Location Based Services at a given device in order for the associated content to install and function correctly. Hence each set of attribute data is indicative of the attributes of a given device that an associated content can expect and or require to install and function correctly.

Server can be based on any well known server environment including a module that houses one or more central processing units e.g. processing unit volatile memory e.g. random access memory persistent memory e.g. hard disk devices memory and network interfaces e.g. interface to allow server to communicate over relevant links such as links . For example server can be a Sun Fire V480 running a UNIX operating system from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. having four central processing units each operating at about nine hundred megahertz and having about sixteen gigabytes of random access memory. However it is to be emphasized that this particular server is merely exemplary and a vast array of other types of computing environments for server are contemplated. Those skilled in the art will now recognize that non volatile storage and volatile storage are examples of computer readable media that can store programming instructions executable on the processors of each server. It is further appreciated that server can comprise any suitable number of servers that can perform different functionality of server implementations described herein.

Processing unit comprises any suitable processor or combination of processors including but not limited to a microprocessor a central processing unit CPU and the like. Other suitable processing units are within the scope of present implementations.

Memory can comprise any suitable memory device including but not limited to any suitable one of or combination of volatile memory non volatile memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM hard drive optical drive flash memory magnetic computer storage devices e.g. hard disks floppy disks and magnetic tape optical discs and the like. Other suitable memory devices are within the scope of present implementations. In particular memory is enabled to store application .

Communication interface comprises any suitable communication interface or combination of communication interfaces. In particular interface is enabled to communicate with devices via links . Accordingly interface is enabled to communicate according to any suitable protocol including but not limited to wired protocols wireless protocols cell phone protocols wireless data protocols Internet protocols packet based protocols analogue PSTN public switched telephone network protocols WiFi protocols WiMax protocols a combination of two or more of such protocols and or the like.

Database can be any suitable database and can be stored on one or more database servers not depicted in communication with server . Alternatively database can be stored at memory device .

Each link can comprise any suitable combination of wired and or wireless links as desired including but not limited to cables wired networks wireless networks the Internet packet based networks analog networks the PSTN LAN networks WAN networks WiFi networks WiMax networks or the like.

Referring briefly now to each device can be any type of electronic device that can be used in a self contained manner and to interact with server via links . Interaction includes displaying of information on a device as well as to receive input at a device that can in turn be sent to server via a respective link . It should be emphasized that the structure in is purely exemplary and contemplates a device that can be used for both wireless voice e.g. telephony and wireless data e.g. email web browsing text communications.

Device thus includes at least one input device . Input device is generally enabled to receive input data and can comprise any suitable combination of input devices including but not limited to a keyboard a keypad a pointing device a mouse a track wheel a trackball a touchpad a touch screen and the like. Other suitable input devices are within the scope of present implementations.

Input from input device is received at processor which can be implemented as a plurality of processors . Processor is configured to communicate with a non volatile storage unit e.g. Erasable Electronic Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM Flash Memory and a volatile storage unit e.g. random access memory RAM . Programming instructions that implement the functional teachings of device as described herein are typically maintained persistently in non volatile storage unit and used by processor which makes appropriate utilization of volatile storage during the execution of such programming instructions. Those skilled in the art will now recognize that non volatile storage unit and volatile storage are examples of computer readable media that can store programming instructions executable on processor .

In particular non volatile storage can store an application for accessing server such as an application for accessing a content distribution service which can be processed by processor .

Processor in turn can also be coupled to a display and optionally a speaker. Display comprises any suitable one or combination of CRT cathode ray tube and or flat panel displays e.g. LCD liquid crystal display plasma OLED organic light emitting diode capacitive or resistive touchscreens and the like .

In some implementations input device and display are external to device with processor in communication with each of input device and display via a suitable connection and or link.

Processor also connects to a network interface which can be implemented in some implementations as radios configured to communicate over respective links . In general it will be understood that interface is configured to correspond with the network architecture that is used to implement a respective link . In other implementations a plurality of links with different protocols can be employed for each device and thus a plurality of interfaces can be provided to support each link. It should be understood that in general a wide variety of configurations for device are contemplated.

Returning to it is further contemplated that each of devices can be differently or similarly configured as defined by attributes associated with each device . Such differences can include but are not limited to each device can have a different screen size of display each device can be associated with different service data access plans that support different data connection rates limits and bandwidths each device can have different GPS Global Positioning System LBS Location Based Service functionality for example some devices can include a GPS module not depicted in while other devices are lacking a GPS module and each device can comprise different operating systems. Other different or similar attributes are within the scope of present implementations.

In any event it is appreciated that some content that can be received from for example database in the form of installation data will run on some of devices and will not run on other of devices .

For example in present implementations device comprises a mobile electronic device with the combined functionality of a personal digital assistant a cell phone and an email paging device. Many well known cellular telephone models or variants thereof are suitable for present implementations.

Furthermore in present implementations device comprises a tablet device with the combined functionality of a mobile computer a personal digital assistant a communication device a network access device and the like. Many well known tablet devices or variants thereof are suitable for present implementations.

Furthermore in present implementations device comprises a personal computer including but not limited to a laptop computer and the like. Many well known personal computers or variants thereof are suitable for present implementations.

Finally in present implementations device comprises a set top box STB for connection to a television device e.g. display can comprise an external television device . Many well known STBs or variants thereof including but not limited to cable receivers satellite receivers optical fibre receivers PVRs personal video recorders digital media receivers or the like are suitable for present implementations.

In any event it is understood that each device can have different attributes to provide different or similar functionality. It is further appreciated that while four devices are described herein any suitable number of devices are within the scope of present implementations.

Attributes of each device can be stored in database as respective attribute data via a provisioning process and or a registration process. In other implementations attribute data can be stored in a different database e.g. at a different registration server or the like accessible to server . For example respective attribute data can comprise an indication of a respective operating system screen size functionality such as GPS LBS functionality data plan or the like for each device .

It is yet further appreciated that attribute data need not be stored for all devices . For example in some implementations device comprises a personal computer which can be used to access server to search for content and cause content to be pushed to other devices for example via a browser application but is not configured to process content stored at database . In these implementations attribute data is optionally not provisioned and or stored at database or the like.

It is yet further appreciated that devices are associated with one another as indicated by the stippled box surrounding attribute data in . For example devices can be associated with a given user and or a given account or the like. For example devices can all be associated with a given account at server and device can be associated with devices by virtue of device being used to access the given account at server .

Attention is now directed to which depicts a method for selection and distribution of content. In order to assist in the explanation of method it will be assumed that method is performed using system . Furthermore the following discussion of method will lead to a further understanding of system and its various components. However it is to be understood that system and or method can be varied and need not work exactly as discussed herein in conjunction with each other and that such variations are within the scope of present implementations. It is appreciated that in the following description method is implemented in system by processing unit . Furthermore in the description of method reference will be made to which are each substantially similar to with like elements having like numbers.

It will further be assumed in the following description that server is being accessed from device via link though it is appreciated that server can be accessed from any of devices .

At and with reference to a request is received at server from device via link . Request generally comprises a request to provide content available to devices . For example request can comprise a request initiated from application to access a content distribution service. It is further appreciated that request is understood to have been received by server for example via link from device . Alternatively a communication session between server and device can be established in which device logs in to a content distribution service such as application via the associated application at device . For example as will be described below a rendering of application can be provided at display to access application at server with data being exchanged between applications to cause content to be distributed. Request can further include at least one search parameter. For example request can include text indicating that content corresponding to word games are to be searched.

At server retrieves from database a list of content available for installation at devices that match at least one search parameter of the request and which are available for installation by comparing respective device attributes in the form of attribute data with respective content attributes in the form of content attribute data . For example list can be compiled in the form of database calls to database by first searching for content that meets the at least one search parameter and then filtering the results by retrieving attribute data and then requesting indicators from database of content whose associated content attribute data matches one or more sets of device attribute data . Hence list will include indicators of content that meet both the at least one search parameter e.g. word games and which are available for installation at one or more of devices . In some implementations some content will be installable on one or more of devices but not others of devices and list can comprise a suitable indicator of such. Hence list can comprise indications of which respective content is available for installation at given ones of devices .

At list or an indication thereof is transmitted back to device such that list can be rendered at display for example within application .

A selection of content from list is then received in any suitable manner from input device and device generates selection data indicative of a subset of the content on list selected for installation at respective selected devices . Device then transmits selection data to server and server receives selection data at .

At server processes selection data and causes respective installation data to be pushed to respective selected devices . For example in it is assumed that content associated with installation data is to be pushed to device and content associated with installation data is to be pushed to device and hence selection data comprises selections of respective content and optionally a given respective device on which it is to be installed. Hence server causes installation data to be pushed to device and causes installation data to be pushed to device . In depicted implementations server transmits installation data however in other implementations server transmits instructions to trigger the push of installation data to a push server not depicted or the like which in turn retrieves and transmits installation data to respective devices .

In some implementations associated content can be installed automatically when installation data is received at respective device while in other implementations associated content can be installed upon receiving confirmation that the associated content is to be installed from respective input devices e.g. application provides an indication of receipt of installation data and requests confirmation or the like that the installation is to be installed before proceeding .

Hence method provides a filtered list of content respective to each device and pushes selected content to respective selected devices . Furthermore at least one of the respective selected devices is different from device such that device triggers installation of given selected content at a different computing device from device via selection data .

It is furthermore appreciated that requests for list and associated responses can be implemented in suitable APIs application programming interfaces at either of applications .

Attention is next directed to which depicts a method for selection and distribution of content. In order to assist in the explanation of method it will be assumed that method is performed using system . Furthermore the following discussion of method will lead to a further understanding of system and its various components. However it is to be understood that system and or method can be varied and need not work exactly as discussed herein in conjunction with each other and that such variations are within the scope of present implementations.

In method device e.g. a tablet device is used to search for content via server to cause content to be pushed to device and device e.g. a PDA .

At application is used to search for content on server Discover Content . In other words a search for content is performed in any suitable manner using suitable search terms which can be as general or as specific as desired. At it is determined whether or not discovered content is to be acquired downloaded pushed to selected devices . If not method ends at . Otherwise at it is determined at server whether given selected content is for the active device the device that is accessing server . To determine whether the given selected content is for the active device it is appreciated that server is enabled to determine with which device it is in communication with as described above. The associated attribute data can then be compared to content attribute data of content that meets the search criteria as described above.

When the given selected content is for active device at server causes the content acquisition process to complete for example by causing the given selected content in the form of associated content installation data to be pushed to device at such that the given selected content is delivered to device

Returning to when the given selected content is not for active device at a device is chosen to route the given selected content to for example device it is assumed that the content attribute data of the given selected content generally matches attribute data of device . At it is determined whether device is on line for example by pinging device and or by determining whether device is currently registered with an associated network. When device is not on line at the given selected content in the form of associated content installation data is stored until device is on line for example at a push server.

When device is on line the given selected content is delivered pushed to device at in the form of associated content installation data .

Attention is now directed to which depict a rendering of a GUI Graphic User Interface for selection and distribution of content as rendered at for example device . In other words in it is assumed that device PDA is the active device. depicts a search screen in which search criteria can be received in a field for example word games. depicts the search results and includes list of content available for installation at devices that match the at least one search parameter and that are available for installation at devices . In depicted non limiting example implementations content was found for installation on device and device specifically an Application A was found that could be installed on either of device PDA and device Tablet . However an Application B was also found except Application B could be installed on device but not devices STB . It is appreciated that an application can then be selected from list for installation at a selected device . For example either Application A could be selected and options are then provided as in to trigger pushing of associated installation data to device and or device . In some implementations each device is selected via respective checkboxes or the like e.g. radio buttons selectable icons etc. and when selections are received an INSTALL virtual button or the like is actuated which causes selection data to be transmitted to server which in turn causes the associated installation data to be transmitted to each selected device . It is appreciated that each set of installation data can be different for each device even though the associated application is the same.

After one or more content has been installed on one or more of devices any of the devices can communicate with the server to obtain status information regarding which content is installed on which device s and additionally indication or recommendation information about content available for installation collectively referred to as installed content information . At a block of server receives a request for installed content information from one of the devices referred to as the active device such as active device . The request is transmitted from device to server via link . This request may be similar to request discussed above with reference to .

The request can comprise a request initiated from application to access a content distribution service. It is further appreciated that the request is understood to have been received by server for example via link from device . Alternatively a communication session between server and device can be established in which device logs in to a content distribution service such as application via the associated application at device . For example as will be described below a rendering of application can be provided at display to access application at server with data being exchanged between applications to cause content to be distributed.

In response at a block server interfaces with database to retrieve a list of installed content information corresponding to the active device and the other devices associated with the active device a user account or user. Since server pushed or coordinated pushing specific content to specific devices server and or database has a complete history of what content has been installed on which of devices . Moreover since server and or database is also the repository for content and associated attribute data about the content e.g. to determine the type of devices that can handle respective content server is able to provide indication or recommendations about content suitable for installation.

Once the list has been compiled the list or an indication thereof is transmitted from server to the active device via link block . The list can then be displayed at display of active device by for example application . Examples of such a list are shown in at a list and in as a list .

Attention is next directed to which depicts GUI in another mode. In these implementations a list is provided which shows content which is INSTALLED at the active device which content is installed at other devices which is UNAVAILABLE for active device content is installed at other devices but AVAILABLE for active device as well as content installed at device which is AVAILABLE for other devices . For example the INSTALLED and UNAVAILABLE sections of list are similar to list . However list further provides an AVAILABLE section which indicates that Application A presently installed on PDA can also be selected for installation at device TABLET . Similarly an Application F installed at devices can also be selected and installed at device

In any event list comprises an indication that given content installed at a given device is available for installation at other devices . Determination of whether given content is available for a given device can be based on comparing attribute data of a given device with content attribute data . In any event list comprises an indication that given content installed at a given device is unavailable for installation at other devices . Determination of whether given content is unavailable for a given device can be based on comparing attribute data of a given device with content attribute data .

It is further appreciated that database or the like further stores indications of what content is installed on what device . For example such indications can be stored in attribute data and or separately. These indications can be accessed by server to generate lists . It is furthermore appreciated that lists can be generated separately and or as part of list .

It is furthermore appreciated that lists can be sorted and provided in any suitable manner. In some implementations lists can be sorted according to at least one of respective content e.g. by application the plurality of associated computing devices and availability for installation of each of the respective applications.

A selection of content from list or is then received in any suitable manner from input device and the active device generates a selection data indicative of a subset of the content on list or selected for installation at respective selected devices . Active device transmits the selection data to server and server receives such selection data at a block .

Lastly at a block server processes the received selection data and causes respective installation data to be pushed to respective selected devices . In some implementations server transmits installation data however in other implementations server transmits instructions to trigger the push of installation data to a push server not depicted or the like which in turn retrieves and transmits appropriate installation data to respective devices .

In some implementations associated content can be installed automatically when installation data is received at respective device while in other implementations associated content can be installed upon receiving confirmation that the associated content is to be installed from respective input devices e.g. application provides an indication of receipt of installation data and requests confirmation or the like that the installation is to be installed before proceeding .

Hence method provides a list or of content respective to each device and pushes selected content to respective selected devices . Furthermore at least one of the respective selected devices is different from the active device such that active device triggers installation of given selected content at a different computing device from active device via the selection data.

It is furthermore appreciated that requests for list and associated responses can be implemented in suitable APIs application programming interfaces at either of applications .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some implementations the functionality of server and devices can be implemented using pre programmed hardware or firmware elements e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs electrically erasable programmable read only memories EEPROMs etc. or other related components. In other implementations the functionality of server and devices can be achieved using a computing apparatus that has access to a code memory not shown which stores computer readable program code for operation of the computing apparatus. The computer readable program code could be stored on a computer readable storage medium which is fixed tangible and readable directly by these components e.g. removable diskette CD ROM ROM fixed disk USB drive . Furthermore it is appreciated that the computer readable program can be stored as a computer program product comprising a computer usable medium. Further a persistent storage device can comprise the computer readable program code. It is yet further appreciated that the computer readable program code and or computer usable medium can comprise a non transitory computer readable program code and or non transitory computer usable medium. Alternatively the computer readable program code could be stored remotely but transmittable to these components via a modem or other interface device connected to a network including without limitation the Internet over a transmission medium. The transmission medium can be either a non mobile medium e.g. optical and or digital and or analog communications lines or a mobile medium e.g. microwave infrared free space optical or other transmission schemes or a combination thereof.

It will be appreciated that for clarity purposes the above description describes some embodiments with reference to different functional units or processors. However it will be apparent that any suitable distribution of functionality between different functional units processors or domains may be used without detracting from the invention. For example functionality illustrated to be performed by separate processors or controllers may be performed by the same processor or controller. Hence references to specific functional units are only to be seen as references to suitable means for providing the described functionality rather than indicative of a strict logical or physical structure or organization.

Certain embodiments described herein may be implemented as logic or a number of modules engines components or mechanisms. For example applications and or methods . A module engine logic component or mechanism collectively referred to as a module may be a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and configured or arranged in a certain manner. In certain example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more components of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion or firmware note that software and firmware can generally be used interchangeably herein as is known by a skilled artisan as a module that operates to perform certain operations described herein.

In various embodiments a module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. within a special purpose processor application specific integrated circuit ASIC or array to perform certain operations. A module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software or firmware to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that a decision to implement a module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by for example cost time energy usage and package size considerations.

Accordingly the term module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which modules or components are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the modules or components need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the modules or components comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure the processor to constitute a particular module at one instance of time and to constitute a different module at a different instance of time.

Modules can provide information to and receive information from other modules. Accordingly the described modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiples of such modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the modules. In embodiments in which multiple modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple modules have access. For example one module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .
