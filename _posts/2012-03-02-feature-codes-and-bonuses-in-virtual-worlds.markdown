This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60 868 793 filed on Dec. 6 2006 incorporated herein by reference and provisional application Ser. No. 60 946 829 filed on Jun. 28 2007 incorporated herein by reference.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 951 007 filed on Dec. 5 2007 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60 946 829 filed on Jun. 28 2007 and 60 868 793 filed on Dec. 8 2006.

The disclosure of this patent document incorporates material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records for the limited purposes required by the law but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This application relates generally to a system and method for product sales and marketing including a continued online relationship of the manufacturer producer with the user of the product even after the product has been sold including encouraging the purchase of ancillary products.

More specifically this application relates to an Entertainment System including a website in combination with a commercially purchased toy wherein the system allows a toy user to register the toy online using a registration code allowing the user access to various activities and scenarios in a virtual world including a virtual representation of the toy via a computer connected to the Internet. Additional ancillary products are also provided that are related to the real toy or the virtual world with these products also being provided with one or more codes to provide additional content and bonus access in the virtual world.

A consumer who purchases a product typically does not have any continued interaction with the product manufacturer or supplier. For example a consumer purchases a toy e.g. a stuffed plush animal or other creature etc. as a gift for a child for example and that child then uses the toy for imaginative activities. However the toy manufacturer relationship with the toy does not typically continue until the next toy is purchased.

Provided are a plurality of embodiments the invention including but not limited to a method for providing a virtual world presentation to a user for user entertainment said method comprising the steps of 

Also provided is a method for providing a virtual world presentation to a user for user entertainment said method comprising the steps of 

Further provided is method for providing a virtual world presentation to a user for user entertainment said method comprising the steps of 

Also provided is a method comprising distributing a first product with a code that allows access only to a first portion of a website and distributing a second product that is an accessory for said first product and which has a code that allows access to a second portion of said website wherein said second portion has a them that is based on said accessory.

Also provided are additional embodiments of the invention some but not all of which are described hereinbelow in more detail.

This lack of continuity represents a lost opportunity to take advantage of the fact that the child or other toy owner likely wants to create a whole imaginative world for the toy for play purposes. A means of creating a such an imaginative world using modern computer tools such as a personal computer connected to the internet wherein the toy can be utilized in a computer generated virtual world for various games and activities given a name and a history and taken care of would allow the owner a more varied and interactive means of playing with the toy.

Further such a virtual world could be used to maintain the relationship between the toy owner and the toy manufacturer or alternatively a retailer or service provider allowing new toys accessories and services of the manufacturer retailer or other provider to be offered to the toy owner thereby increasing the potential market for the manufacturer and increasing the usage of the toy by the user. Such a virtual world could also provide many educational and gaming scenarios that would engage a child or adult with many hours of play.

Furthermore such a virtual world could increase the attachment that the toy owner feels for the toy and thus increase the likelihood that additional toy or accessory purchases would occur and also increasing the satisfaction the owner feels with the toy thus extending the relationship between the toy manufacture and the toy owner.

In addition such a virtual world could be utilized to encourage the purchase of ancillary products such as accessory items for the toy. The purchase of such accessory items could also be linked to the virtual world to even further increase the attachment that the toy owner feels to the toy with the accessories.

Even further additional products could be marketed to the toy owner that might be more remotely related to the toy such as personal care products school products games and many other types of products.

Additionally by engaging the toy owner in the virtual world advertising and other marketing advantages would likely occur because of the additional satisfaction that the toy its accessory products and other products would provide hence leading to potential word of mouth and other means of marketing the toy and the website.

Finally a similar approach could be applied to products other than toys such as collectibles trading materials etc.

Accordingly a system for creating such a virtual world to take advantage of such marketing potential might provide some or all of the listed benefits and even additional benefits.

Provided is an entertainment system including an online virtual world where the user of a product can register the product using a unique registration code provided with the product at purchase where the registration code is typically hidden from view until after purchase or use of the product or provided after or during purchase. The registration ensures that a valid purchase has occurred. This registration code provides access to certain online content that would not be otherwise available to the user without the code. An example of such a system is disclosed in application Ser. No. 11 027 880 filed on Dec. 30 2004 and incorporated herein by reference.

Also provided is a system where ancillary items such as accessory items or items of personal interest to a purchaser related or not to the product are also provided where each one of such items is also provided with one or more special codes that are typically hidden from view prior to purchase and or use where these special codes provide additional online content that would not be otherwise available to the user without the code s . Such codes might be registration codes that are used to register the product and or they might be feature codes that provide bonus features to the user in the virtual world.

In the example embodiments discussed in the above cited reference provided is an Entertainment System including an online virtual world where the user of a toy can register the toy using a unique registration number provided with the toy at purchase adopt the toy online receive and play with a virtual representation of the toy the virtual toy in the virtual world. In some embodiments the virtual world can be implemented using an interactive website via a user computer connected to the Internet. In this manner a user can play with the virtual toy in a computer generated fantasy world i.e. the virtual world .

The term toy could be any type of toy for example those used by a child including for example plush toys including but not limited to stuffed animals fantasy figures dinosaurs vehicles dolls etc. along with other types of toys including but not limited to vehicles such as cars and trucks action figures such as army figures monsters sports figures fantasy figures dinosaurs and dolls etc. . Additional products could also be utilized in a similar manner such as collectibles including figurines for example trading cards jewelry personal products etc.

Accessory items to the toy that are in a different class of products than the toy can be provided. For example if the toy is a plush animal accessory items such as clothing trading cards and charms for example each of which is a different class of product can also be provided for sale where these items also come with their own respective registration code that provides additional content in the virtual world after the registration codes are entered by the user. For example an accessory item could be clothing that can be worn by the real world version of the toy. This clothing may come with a registration code that when entered by the user provides a piece of virtual clothing for the virtual toy that looks similar to the real clothing provided for the real toy. Similarly charms that can be worn by the real toy may also come with a similar registration code that when entered by the user provides a similar virtual charm that can be worn by the virtual toy or worn by an image of the virtual toy.

Some items that may not be accessories to the toy but might encompass similar themes might be sold with a hidden registration code that provides a virtual item that is similar to the purchased item and that might be put to a similar use. For example trading cards which could be used in a game might be sold with a registration code that when entered by the user provides virtual trading cards that may be used for one or more games played in the virtual world i.e. online . The virtual trading cards might be similar to or different than the real trading cards. Furthermore the trading cards may have images of various types of the toy. For example various images of plush animals that are sold could be provided on the cards.

Graphics animation sound and recorded images might be utilized to generate the virtual world and virtual toy. Even live images might be utilized if desired. In addition other sources of material can also be employed. In essence the virtual world creates an interactive playland for the toy owner to encourage imagination using the toy and at the same time provide an incentive to purchase additional toys or encourage additional individuals to also purchase toys in order to participate in the Entertainment System.

Throughout this disclosure the term virtual is used for example to describe the user viewable hearable material presented to the user on the user computer from data and or computer programs and commands generated and or provided by the Entertainment System to the user computer running one or more computer applications e.g. a web browser with the appropriate plug ins applets and or other support programs etc. . The System provides the data and or programs via a communication network connected to the System and the user computer e.g. the Internet .

The term virtual does not necessarily mean that the displayed item is not real because the displayed item could for example be a video or picture of a real item for example. Furthermore the virtual world is presented using real physical phenomena e.g. light and sound and is impacted by real user interactions e.g. mouse and keyboard manipulations . Rather the term virtual is used to describe the computer generated and or provided presentation to the user including both visual and audible effects via the user computer. It is a virtual world in the sense that it is primarily a computer presented fantasy world with which the user can interact via manipulations of the user computer. In this manner the virtual items of the virtual world can be presented as interacting with each other and with the user. Furthermore the user is provided access to games and trivia as well.

In a first example embodiment of a virtual world disclosed in application Ser. No. 11 027 880 the user buys a toy such as a plush animal registers the toy in a website at an URL listed on the toy or toy packaging or a tag on the toy. Various classes of toy may be utilized. For example the class of toy may be a plush animal which could have a number of different types of members lions bears dogs cats fish etc. . Other possible classes of toys include soldier figures vehicles dolls etc. Additional classes include accessories to the toys that are used with the toys e.g. weapons for the soldiers clothing for dolls etc. or even classes of less related peripheral items such as clothing for the user toiletries etc. Thus various classes of products can be accommodated and utilized for the methods disclosed herein and obvious modifications thereof.

The System serves pages of a website that provides the virtual world to the user using various web pages flash images video etc. providing a biography of the toy a virtual representation of the toy a virtual toy using graphics and or sound such as an animated image for example to participate in games and activities. The system also provides a virtual means for maintaining the virtual health and well being of the character through various maintenance activities such as virtual feeding and playing virtual shopping and virtual medical checkups for example.

Furthermore in these example embodiments the Entertainment System can be utilized for marketing additional toys and or accessories and or services related to the toy to allow restricted access to additional online activities and features to those who purchase the toys.

The Entertainment System of the example embodiments may provide some general services and features open to the public such as information about the toys and where to purchase them a description of the features of the website and other similar information. The website might also offer tiered access depending on whether the user has entered a registration code or has purchased any virtual characters that are not representing a corresponding purchased toy for example . However a primary purpose of the System in the first example embodiment is to encourage the public to purchase a toy at a retail establishment to obtain a registration code for access to the primary features and services. Accordingly many of the primary features of the System are restricted to registered users to encourage toy purchase. The existence of the System may encourage initial sales of the toy by new users such as via word of mouth from current users and the System will also encourage the purchase of additional toys by current users.

Online sales may be supported and encouraged in an alternate embodiment to gain additional revenue but in the first example embodiment the invention is primarily intended to be utilized to sell toys in retail establishments. Thus the invention becomes a marketing tool utilizing word of mouth and the desire to increase participation in the virtual world and thusly makes the toys more attractive to retail merchants and increases their sales.

In essence the present invention in this first example embodiment provides an Entertainment System including an online virtual world with a virtual toy representing a toy purchased at a retail store. The toys might be plush toy animals for example. However there is no limit to the type of toy that the system could support as long as the toy can be represented by a virtual replica.

The current system functions basically as follows A consumer purchases a toy such as the plush toy animal representing a particular animal for example or some other toy . The toy includes for example a tag attached to the toy body or the toy packaging or alternatively another indicator and or a storage device indicating a web site address and a registration code. The code is typically hidden from view until after the purchase has occurred to prevent unauthorized use of the code. For example the code might be on the inside of a folded piece of paper that is sealed prior to purchase. The user can load the System web site using the web address in a browser application running on the user s computer and then enter the registration code to register the toy thereby obtaining access to restricted portions of the System website.

In an alternative embodiment the code can be automatically entered via the storage device for example for automatically loading and or downloading and or registering the user with the System.

Registration allows the user to participate in a virtual adoption process utilizing a virtual online replica of the toy the virtual toy to provide an analogous online representation of the toy. The virtual toy would preferably look somewhat like the real toy e.g. same type of animal similar shapes color patterns etc. but could be more cartoonized for example and can be animated automatically and or by user control which may or may not be the case for the real toy.

The registered user can then participate in various activities both for enjoyment and to virtually maintain the virtual toy in a happy healthy contented state.

The System of the first example embodiment utilizes a server subsystem including a web server subsystem for generating both dynamic and static web pages as is known in the art and for receiving data and or commands from the user computer. One or more databases support the functioning of this server subsystem. The web server utilizes various scripting or other executable programs for providing dynamic content to the user s computer which is attached to the web server via some computer network such as the Internet for example. The web server can also utilize various animated motion programs such as a Flash program Java scripts etc. to provide dynamic content to the user.

If the user has not yet purchased a toy the user can still access the System to obtain information about the System and or the toys but will not in the first example embodiment have access to much of the site until a toy is purchased and registered.

The Entertainment System is comprised of a server subsystem for interacting with the users via a user computer being operated by the user. The server subsystem can utilize a server for serving content including web pages data commands and or programs for example to the user computer. In addition the server subsystem can include a reception subsystem for receiving information and commands from the users . Alternatively the server and reception subsystem might be combined into a single computer application such as a commercially available web server for example running on one or more computers. The current system will utilize commercially available applications to implement much of the server subsystem.

The Entertainment System also comprises a Storage Subsystem for storing system data user IDs and passwords toy registration codes personalized user information etc. utilized by the various subsystems. The Storage Subsystem of the current system will utilize a commercially available database application running on commercially available hardware for example.

A Registration Subsystem is used for registering the user and the user s toy into the system so that the user has access to restricted portions of the system. The Registration Subsystem may utilize its own dedicated application and hardware or could be combined with or share the Server Subsystem applications and or hardware. The registration subsystem examines the registration code against stored data relating to a plurality of registration codes each representing a toy for sale.

A Virtual World Providing Subsystem generates and or provides the virtual world data to be served by the server to the users for use in displaying a virtual world on the users computers. Portions of this data may be generated on the fly in response to user interactions and portions are likely to be obtained and or derived from data stored in the Storage Subsystem . For example in the first example embodiment items owned by the user the items in the dock for example the virtual room state virtual furniture in the room for example virtual cash health happiness hunger parameters are all examples of stored data whereas data generated on the fly include position in the room which also gets stored and Arcade Game scores all of which are described in more detail below .

Again the Subsystem may utilize unique applications and or hardware or may be combined with one or more of the Registration Subsystem and or the Server Subsystem applications and hardware.

These example embodiments can utilize the Internet as the public communications network. However other communications networks could be utilized such as telephone networks cellular networks dedicated networks cable TV networks power lines etc. Furthermore combinations of these networks can be used for various functions. However because of the ubiquitous nature of the Internet a solution utilizing that diverse network which can utilize many individual communications networks is utilized in the first example embodiment.

Furthermore the System might also utilize a private communication network for at least part of the system. For example the Registration Subsystem of might be connected to a private computer network located at the Retail Merchant where the user might register the toy for example as discussed in more detail below. Alternatively the toy might automatically be registered at the time of purchase e.g. by scanning a code at the register for example and thus not require any user interaction at all beyond purchasing the toy. Or the user might send in a registration card to implement registration as another example.

Note that although shows a plurality of servers A n a plurality of CPUs A n and a plurality of database storage devices A n any of these might be implemented on one or more shared computers in various configurations executing one or more computer program applications as desired. As the number of users supported by the system B grows additional hardware can be added to increase the capacity of the system as necessary in a manner similar to that shown in the Figure.

Continuing with showing the more complex implementation B a plurality of users can be supported in various configurations. For example a plurality of users B operating single workstations A individually connected to the public communications network can be supported. Furthermore complex user networks can also be supported. Retailers and or Toy Manufacturers might also have access to the system as represented by the example shown in A should an online ordering system be implemented for selling toys. Of course alternate implementations are also possible depending on the types and number of users and or retailers being supported and also depending on the state of the art computer technology.

In one example embodiment the System uses an Apache web server running in a Linux environment. For webserver hardware an Intel 2 Ghz CPUs with 2 GB RAM running Gentoo Linux with the appropriate extensions can be utilized. The server will serve flash content to a web browser running a web browser application using PHP Perl and actionscript and flash plugins. A MySQL database application will also be utilized for the storage subsystem. Alternatively commercially available programs such as Microsoft IIS and Microsoft SQL Server 2000 running on a Windows Server 2003 machine could be utilized.

The client user side Flash application makes the calls to a number of PHP files. These PHP files then interface with the MySQL database to obtain the necessary data. All are served by the Apache web server which can serve HTML XML along with the appropriate flash and other content. For multi user environments e.g. the multi user rooms discussed below these are served by a socket server written in Perl.

A secure Apache SSL server can be utilized for the registration subsystem likely sharing the computer with the other Apache server.

Items and are parts of adoption center discussed below which is a flash application with PHP backend. Item provides for user registration using a form driven flash application which validates the registration code and creates a user account within the system. A pet creation application is a form driven flash application designed for guiding the user through pet creation process and validating the registration code.

Authentication Login process is a flash application validating user credentials on the server side and spawning an API core in case of validation. It also has module designed for password retrieval based on collected user information and currently passes user data to a client side API and may in the future pass user data and a generated encryption key for a current session to a client side API.

Items are Different media files available on the server subsystem for user use. Item represents Flash Movies and Games available for the user. Item represents the server side API. Chat and Multi user games interactions API MAPI are a part of Client side API and are used for setting up and maintaining connection to the socket server authenticating the user and work in a pass through mode for multi user games environment to exchange messages.

The scheme of the API is subdivided into Client part flash application and Server part PHP script . Flash clip movie Game calls a function within the API client side Core passing a request to some arbitrary data. The Client side API Generator sends the request to Parser server side API. The Server side Core processes it and retrieves data from the database wraps it in XML Generator and sends it back to the Client Side API Parser which calls specified a callback function within originator Flash clip movie Game and passes received data to it.

To ensure users privacy prevent cheating and preserve validity authenticity of information additional security layers can be designed which encrypts all data being passed back and forth in between parts of the APIs client server .

The chosen Encryption technique of the first example embodiment is a modification of TEA routines using a Feistel cipher with 128 bit key. Keys are generated at the login stage and securely passed to client side via HTTPS after which the adoption centre spawns the client side API and passes the encryption data specific for the session. Additional measures which can be taken to prevent cheating and maintain data coherency include using different permutations of the original key for every data transmission.

Various features are provided by the online environment including maintaining the virtual well being of the virtual toy providing a specific Temperament Personality of the toy which can impact the well being of the toy which can include parameters such as happiness hunger and health for example. Also provided are online User Games and Activities which can be used to win more virtual cash or impact the well being of the toy. The user can furnish one or more virtual rooms set up for the virtual toy in addition to adding various virtual accessories the user can purchase virtual food and virtually feed the virtual toy and by playing with the virtual toy the virtual toy s happiness and health parameters can be improved. Playing may however make the toy hungry thus affecting the toy s hunger parameter. The virtual cash may also be used to provide a virtual medical checkup for the virtual toy to improve the virtual toy s health parameter.

In this manner the Entertainment System uses the well being parameters and virtual cash to help balance a platform for providing fun and activities with an incentive to purchase new additional toys and to increase the user s attachment to the physical toy. The fun and enjoyment obtained through the use of the system provides free word of mouth advertising which also helps sell additional physical toys. In this manner the Entertainment System is a marketing tool that will increase the overall sales of the toys and thus provide a benefit to retailers selling the toys.

The toys that provide access codes might be for example plush toy animals e.g. pets an example drawing of which is shown in robots action figures figures based on cartoon characters vehicles aliens inanimate objects etc. The toy may be paired with a hang tag or other device having the system website address and a registration code imprinted thereon or stored therein an example of which is shown in B. Alternatively an electronic storage device such as a USB key or wireless RF tag or Bluetooth device could be embedded within or provided with the toy and or its packaging at purchase. The electronic device would then have the registration code stored in the device using electronic memory RAM ROM EEPROM etc. for example. As electronic storage devices become cheaper using such a device for storing the registration code may become the preferred approach.

For the example embodiments after the user takes the toy home the user begins the registration process by visiting the Entertainment System website using the address on the tag and a user computer via an Internet connection to load the home page for example and the user registers the toy such as by entering the registration code thus receiving access to the various online features of the invention as discussed herein.

The registration process of the first example embodiment is performed by manually entering the registration code printed on the registration tag via the user computer connected to the Internet. The user also chooses a user ID and password. The System can ensure that at least the combination of ID and password is unique or might also insure that each user ID is unique as well.

Personal information might also be requested in order to recover user ID and password information. Such personal information might be a favorite color user s birthdate etc.

In an alternative embodiment using an electronic storage device with the registration code stored therein the electronic device can communicate with the user computer via a corresponding device and thus automatically or manually transfer the registration code to the user computer. For example the System could request that the user plug in a USB key into the user computer at the appropriate time or the user computer may wirelessly read an RF or Bluetooth device located in or on the toy.

In the first exemplary embodiment after the user enters the registration code and before or after the user enters the user ID and password the System checks the registration code in any one of a number of ways. In essence the System uses stored data relating to all of the registration codes associated with corresponding toys for sale.

The system might check the registration code against a list of valid registration codes stored in the system database for example. In this case the stored data are the actual registration codes themselves. If there is a match the registration code has been validated and the system then determines the type of toy that the user purchased based on information stored with the registration code in the database. For example each code could be linked to information about the type of toy e.g. a basset hound a fish a lion a robot a soldier etc. its coloration and appearance its temperament etc.

The System may display a user agreement at some point providing the terms of usage and legal notices for example. The System might require an affirmative response from the user in order to complete registration.

In such an embodiment discussed above it would be beneficial to make each registration code unique and complicated in order to make it difficult for an imposter or unauthorized user to make up a code or use a previously registered number to obtain unauthorized access or unauthorized additional virtual toys.

As an alternative after being entered the registration code is used in a mathematical algorithm to determine its authenticity and such an algorithm might also be used to determine the type of toy being registered. For example all lion plush toy registration codes might start with the letter L followed with a number or a series of digits that can be factored into exactly five prime numbers for example or the number might fall into a particular range or format. Another example is the use of an algorithmic pass code based on a central key value. In these examples the stored data relating to the registration codes provides the proper information to perform the validation process e.g. the proper letters number ranges acceptable factors the central key or the algorithm itself . Accordingly by these methods the actual registration numbers need not be stored but could still be verified. Then perhaps by storing the registered registration code uniqueness could be guaranteed by never allowing that same code to be used again.

Of course additional techniques can be used to determine a registration code s authenticity as well as long as the registration process ensures that it is likely the user has purchased a valid toy and thus is an appropriate user of the System.

Note that alternative means of registering the toy are also possible in alternative embodiments. For example the user might phone in the registration code using a telephone and be given a user ID and password or choose one over the phone. Or the user may register the toy at the place of purchase using a dedicated or general purpose computer on a private network. Or if the toy is purchased online the registration might occur at the time of purchase before the user has obtained the actual physical toy. Thus different communication networks may be utilized for registration as are utilized for website access for example.

The System website can present various interactive scenes into which the virtual toy is incorporated. In the first exemplary embodiment the toy characters can be animals that reside in a virtual village for example. New features can be opened based on the number of toy animals a user owns and registers. For example there might be a special adventure that opens when the user purchases and registers his fifth toy regardless of what those toys are.

In an alternative embodiment the scenes might be customized based on the type of toy. For example a basset hound plush animal could be shown in an urban landscape or setting. Likewise a cow could be shown in the countryside a monkey in the jungle and a lobster under the sea as additional examples.

Furthermore in another embodiment each type of toy might have different traits that can impact the way the toy reacts based on the type of toy. Thus a toy lion might be a mean carnivore while a toy monkey eats fruit and is playful for example. Soldiers might be aggressive while dancers are graceful for example. Thus any of the above concepts are not limited to animal toys but could easily support other toys such as human dolls robots machines soldiers etc.

Having virtually adopted their toy by registering it with the System the consumer can then participate in a variety of online games some involving the virtual representation of the toy i.e. the virtual toy . These games can include adventure games trivia games arcade style games and the like. Participants can collect virtual cash which is virtual money which can be spent to purchase virtual items for their toys as discussed above and below. This virtual cash may or may not be useable at other sites and may or may not represent legal tender.

Furthermore a participant may purchase additional toys or other products register them which then associates them with the user s ID adopt them which adds them to their virtual world thus creating additional virtual toys. These purchases are preferred to be actual toy purchases using legal tender where the user obtains a real toy. However in an alternative embodiment virtual toys represented only online might also be utilized whether purchased with legal tender or merely online money .

After registration each of the new toys is represented as a virtual toy which can interact with other virtual toys including those created to represent other actual toys including team game play for example. Participants can also chat with other registered users using online chatting or posting features. The first example embodiment utilizes a symbol chat with preset icons rather than general text chat to protect children from inappropriate language. However generalized chatting features could also be added such as provided by a commercially available chat program for example.

The virtual items in the virtual world can be made to interact with each other. For example the virtual toy might sit in virtual chair or climb on top of a virtual table. The virtual toy might walk around the virtual world and play with its own virtual toys. Virtual toys may play and interact with each other. Virtual accessories might be placed on a table and virtual pictures can be hung on a virtual wall. Virtual chairs might be moved around and slid up to a virtual table. The virtual toy might sit in a chair. Virtual food might be placed on a virtual plate for example and the virtual toy may simulate eating the virtual food. Thus the user is provided with an animated display of these interactions including both video and or audio components. In this manner the virtual world simulates activity in the real world.

The user can also zoom in and out of various views virtually move from room to room i.e. display different rooms etc. all by manipulating the mouse and keyboard of the user computer.

The virtual world and the games represented on the Entertainment System website may be changed and updated on a regular basis to maintain the interest of the user participants. For example trivia game questions may be updated and new games periodically added.

Further new types of plush toy animals can be periodically introduced to encourage consumers to make additional purchases. Special or limited addition toys could be introduced for example on holidays. For example an American bald eagle might be introduced to commemorate Independence Day and a Santa Claus for Christmas. These new toys can be introduced to the user in a virtual manner and the user encouraged to purchase the actual toy. Bonuses of virtual cash or special activities might be provided to those who do purchase special toys.

Subsequent purchases of toys when registered may lead to increasingly greater deposits of virtual cash as a reward. For example the first toy registration may lead to 1500 in virtual cash a second purchase and registration may add 2000 and a third add 2500 for example. Furthermore purchasing and registering a certain number of toys could lead to bonuses such as additional virtual rooms and or access to additional games e.g. an outdoor tennis court with game . These bonuses encourage subsequent purchases and keep the user interested in both the System and the toys.

Additional features that can be included in additional embodiments as discussed above are incorporating a storage medium into the plush toy animal or peripheral products instead of or as a complement to the registration tags for example. This might allow the online profile of the toy including everything the toy has learned to be stored in the device with the toy. The toy could then be connected to another computer at another location for example at a friend s house in order to participate in online activities as long as that computer is connected to the Internet for example. Furthermore the storage medium could be used to store other information for its owner such as homework assignments photographs music or shortcuts to favorite online websites.

The Entertainment System website that provides this virtual world is a site where children and other toy owners that own an appropriate toy can adopt and care for their virtual toy e.g. virtual pets play games and go on adventures as discussed above. After registration the user can begin to enjoy the complete game in the virtual world which is a combination of caring for the toy going on fun adventures being surprised by rollovers and trivia and generally having interesting and entertaining experiences. It is a multi faceted world rich in amusement and learning opportunities including both audio and video graphics animation photos etc. representations.

In at least one exemplary embodiment there are about seven or more main sections to explore in this virtual world. These can include the home page public pages adoption center checkup clinic one or more virtual rooms arcade and game areas a clubhouse chat areas etc.

In particular the virtual toy has a room that is made up of a series of animated e.g. Flash based screens that depict the virtual room or rooms where the toy lives eats and plays . In the first exemplary embodiment a single isometric view of the room is provided. is an example screen shot of such a virtual room showing a virtual toy. The virtual room can in time be converted into a large virtual house or even multiple virtual houses through the use of room expansions via spending the virtual cash for example. In the first exemplary embodiment the user can purchase virtual flooring virtual wallpaper or paint and virtual furnishings to prepare the virtual room for the virtual toy. See for the screen shot of an exemplary virtual pet room already furnished showing an animated pig as the virtual pet.

Virtual outdoor yards that have their own virtual furniture and exclusive virtual objects i.e. trees that cannot be placed inside the house for example can also be provided for purchase using virtual cash.

A user interface section located at the bottom of the window known as the dock or Control Panel can also be provided where user may virtually store many or all virtual purchases collectibles and adventure objects for later use or retrieval some of which are functional such as a virtual calculator for example . Where applicable a stored item or object can be placed positioned or arranged in the room by dragging it from the dock. The dock displays a visual description of the virtual toy s well being parameters e.g. a numerical index as the toys need food and attention to remain healthy and happy. Also shown in the dock are the user s point level and available virtual cash earned in virtual games and adventures that can be used throughout the site. shows an example of such a dock in the lower portion of the screen shot. A Family Album which may be available or accessible for viewing from the dock for example can be used to contain all the important documents including for example one or more of 

In an alternative embodiment there might be a number e.g. three of views of the room and each scene might be accompanied by the dock. If the user has multiple registered virtual toys the dock interface will allow the user to switch between toys and view them when not in use. Furthermore a plurality of virtual toys might be moved into a room for interactive play for example.

The user can also add friends to a friends list and then the friends can virtually visit each other s rooms each seeing the same room and playing with their virtual toys both interacting with the room objects and chatting using a chatting tool for example. In the first exemplary embodiment the chatting tool can use chat symbols for example rather than using typed words so that pre defined phrases can be chosen and transmitted to the other participant.

In an alternative embodiment users would be encouraged to revisit by receiving daily rewards such as an allowance or pieces of a puzzle that can be put together or one piece will be put in the puzzle box every day thus encouraging users to revisit.

In the first exemplary embodiment a user can go virtually shopping using the computer in a dedicated shopping location room e.g. at the WShop . This simulated virtual shopping experience allows the user to simulate the purchase of virtual online goods for their virtual toy s . Furthermore real life shopping for additional physical toys and or their accessories such as via mail order can also be supported.

Optionally users can be provided partial access to the site by adopting an online virtual toy for free. Access to many features will be restricted or blocked because no retail toy has been purchased. Users will be able to purchase a retail toy to gain access to the complete site. Accounts may still expire after a certain length of time of free restricted access but under this option users of expired toys can maintain access to their accounts albeit with a different kind of access to the site. That is these users would no longer have the free restricted access. Instead users of expired accounts would enter a new and different tier of access to more of the site or even the entire site but may be excluded from specific site bonuses and features. Alternatively virtual toys could be sold to users providing additional access to the site over and above what the free adoption e.g. free restricted access would provide. This allows users to get many more virtual toys than actual physical toys to avoid the physical restraints of smaller rooms for example.

Furthermore additional enhancements can be provided for additional benefits. For example some information on the toy might be stored locally such as on a USB key which can be carried by the user and used to access the site from various locations.

Feature codes which could include registration codes as examples are codes that provide bonus features and or bonus virtual content for the user of the virtual world. The bonus features and bonus content are tied to and unlocked by the code and are associated with a user account and thus typically not made available to users who do not have the required feature code perhaps because they have not purchased the required product for example . Accordingly feature codes can be used to encourage a user to purchase additional products such as peripheral products that might include accessories to the original toys . Feature codes can also encourage users to perform activities that are desired by a manufacturer retailer and or website hosting organization for example by offering bonus codes in response to participating in certain activities.

The peripheral including accessory products that are provided with feature codes that may also be product registration codes for registering the product can be advertised on the main site and a product store locator can be used to tell registered users where to purchase such products. This service can identify where the retailers closest to the user might be located. In addition the site might advertise various limited time products that are available such as in a news item a pop up ad or a banner ad. shows an exemplary screen shot of a page showing a plurality of such products along with a more detailed description of one of the products and its bonus materials. shows an exemplary screen shot of an informational news page that describes a product and provides a link to a store locator to find a retailer selling the product.

A number of different products could be utilized with this feature code feature. Below is a list of different classes of exemplary products and some possible bonus features that can be provided in response to unlocking an accompanying feature code 

With respect to bonus feature codes typically the bonus feature code is packaged with a real world item. The bonus feature code unlocks a bonus item within the virtual world. That bonus item exists only in the virtual world and can be different than the virtual version of the real world item. The bonus item interacts with and is usable with the virtual version of the real world item.

Therefore the real world item may have a feature code that allows it to be used in the virtual world as a virtual item. The real world item may also have a bonus feature code that produces only a virtual item and does not produce a real world item. That virtual item produced by the feature code is related to and interacts with the virtual version of the real world item.

This technique encourages the consumers to purchase items with bonus codes in order to obtain not just the real world item and its associated virtual item but also the bonus virtual item. In an embodiment that bonus virtual item cannot be obtained any other way other than by purchasing the real world item with which it interacts.

A feature code might be a series of numbers and or letters such as a series of seven numbers and letters for example. The feature code is utilized by the System to provide the bonus features and or bonus virtual content to the user associated with the users account user ID when the user unlocks the code for example by entering it into the system. This could be done by entering the code into an input field on a page of the website. If an improper code is entered such as by entering an improper series of digits for example an unlock or other execute button can be made non functional. Examples of such registration feature codes are shown for the exemplary playing cards in . These feature codes are typically intended to be entered manually. The feature codes may also be stored electronically on an electronic part in which case the feature code can include many more numbers and letters

By entering and unlocking the feature code the system will reward the user with the associated bonus features and or bonus virtual content such as a virtual item being associated with the user s account. Some codes may come with a plurality of such bonuses while other codes may come with only one or even no bonus content at all perhaps as a gag code for example .

A virtual item provided in response to unlocking a feature code might be a virtual representation of the product class such as a set of virtual playing cards that are similar to e.g. used for the same type of games but different than e.g. a different set of images on the virtual cards or a different number of cards the purchased item. Alternatively the virtual item may be only remotely related to the purchased item such as receiving a virtual book in response to purchasing a bookmark. Or the virtual item might be a virtual replica of the purchased item such as when the feature code provided with a virtual charm such as of a pug dog for example provides a virtual replica of the charm such as a virtual image of a pug dog charm in this example . Similarly the purchase of real clothing for the pet may result in a virtual image that is a replica of the clothing thus a yellow raincoat for a boxer plush animal provides a virtual yellow raincoat for the virtual image of the boxer to wear in the virtual world whereas other items of clothing might provide a feature code that allows the user to pick from a selection of virtual clothing and thus the virtual item is similar to e.g. in the same class of clothing but not identical to the real item a different item of clothing .

Replicas will not typically be exactly the same as the original real item because this would be difficult to accomplish technically but are basically of similar design color use etc. Thus a virtual replica of a plush lion would be a virtual representation of the lion to remind the viewer of the plush lion. Similarly a replica of specific toy soldier would be a virtual soldier of the same rank and similar features to remind the viewer of the toy soldier.

As discussed above ancillary products that are related to the primary product can be provided to supplement the primary product and thus provide an additional source of revenue to retailers and or the provider of the virtual world and might provide a continuing source of revenue to either or both parties.

Another embodiment provides accessories to a primary product e.g. accessories to a toy with feature codes that provide virtual accessories in the virtual world. The toy may be represented in the virtual world by use of one feature code. The accessories for the toy are provided in the virtual world by another feature code. These accessories for the toy are things that are usable with the toy and in one embodiment change the appearance of the toy. These may be personal items for the user of the toy educational items game items etc. These accessories products can be provided for sale either online or via retail markets or they might be provided as bonuses or product giveaways to attract customers to a store or a website. These products might all follow a common theme e.g. be related to the toy or virtual world in some manner . Another embodiment provides accessories that are completely independent of the toys but are somehow targeted to the user of the virtual world perhaps just by the nature of providing a working feature code that provides some bonus content in the virtual world to the user .

For the exemplary embodiments discussed above where the primary product for registration in the virtual world is a toy such as a plush animal for example the ancillary products could include such products as lunch boxes clothing for the toy or the user backpacks additional toys stationary trading cards bookmarks toiletries jewelry etc. some of which are discussed above. The wearable items e.g. clothing can be worn by the virtual version of the toy and makes the virtual version of the toy look different. Some of these products might have images of the toys or themes of the virtual world printed thereon for example. Additional products might also include accessories for use with a previously purchased toy such as clothing hats jewelry houses etc. that could be put onto the toy for play in the real world for example.

Such ancillary products could be sold with hidden registration codes associated with the particular product which may or may not be usable for an initial registration for creating some portion of the virtual world. In one embodiment the user might need a primary product such as a plush toy for example to initially create the virtual world with a user name ID and password whereas the registration code and other feature codes provided with secondary products would only register the new product and or add additional bonus features and or other content to an already existing account virtual world for that toy. The registration codes can also act as a feature code by providing bonus content and or other special features to the purchaser user in addition to providing registration of the product. These registration codes provided with these products can then be entered online to receive the additional features bonuses in that user s virtual world i.e. associated with that user s user account . For example access may be provided to games modes of play virtual cash virtual objects special abilities provided to the virtual toy or even downloadable features such as phone ring tones music desktop wallpaper etc. In addition virtual images of the ancillary product or images related to that product could also be provided in response to entering the registration code. Such virtual images might also provide additional functionality in the virtual word e.g. adding special powers or abilities to a virtual pet or another virtual character for example .

For example an ancillary product such as a charm might come with a registration code that when entered creates a virtual representation of that charm that can then be worn by the virtual toy to change the way the virtual toy looks in the virtual world because that virtual toy is wearing that charm. In that case the code is a registration code because it is linked to the purchased product and then the virtual toy may be able to wear the charm similar to a real charm worn by the real toy or the toy user for example. Alternatively a feature code might be provided with the charm that leads to some other bonus material that is not a charm similar to the purchased charm.

Additional bonuses can also be provided which are tied to the registration feature code or tied to additional codes such as other virtual items online games or virtual cash for example and that might be awarded with the registration code or via additional feature codes also provided with the ancillary product. For example alternate embodiments include a feature code that when entered by the user via the website conveys a benefit unrelated to the ancillary product to the user and or the user s virtual toy. For example when such a feature code obtained by purchasing a real charm is entered the user s account can be credited with a sum of virtual cash that the user can use to purchase additional items such as virtual furniture for the virtual toy or real clothing for the user. Another example includes rewarding the user with another virtual toy upon entering a feature code obtained by the user with the purchase of a mouse pad. Similarly clothing could be sold for the real toy or the user with the clothing including a registration code provided with the product that when entered provides bonuses such as similar virtual clothing for use with the virtual representation of the toy in the virtual world associated with that user. Thus similar clothing can be used both in the real world and in the virtual world by purchasing the real clothing with a registration code and then submitting that registration code to unlock and add the similar bonus clothing in the virtual world Again the virtual representation can wear the clothing which hence changes the look of the virtual representation.

Feature codes can also be released that are not tied to a particular product and thus would not be considered registration codes but can still be used by the system to provide bonus content and features to a registered user. For example additional random codes could be distributed with a randomly collectable product e.g. Webkinz Trading Cards where the additional codes are used for additional bonus content but not to register the product nor for providing virtual representations of the product. Products may have randomly different numbers of such codes. For example a deck of cards might have a registration code and from one to five additional feature codes or each card in the deck might have a feature code. The registration code may provide a virtual deck of cards that is similar to or different than the purchased cards whereas the bonus feature codes don t provide any additional cards but provide some other bonus materials when unlocked for example they could provide one or more of virtual cash virtual pets pet accessories access to special games special rooms furniture for a room games virtual charms etc. . Thus the purchaser never knows how many extra feature codes any given package of cards may have or what bonus materials he might receive.

Similarly feature codes could be used as a marketing device giving retailers a free incentive to attract customers and sell related products and or services with the feature codes being handed out to certain customers or potential customers but not necessarily tied to a particular product and thus not used to register a product. For example a number e.g. 50 of free feature code cards might be given to a retailer for buying a certain number or certain dollar amount of wholesale products. The retailers can then distribute those feature codes as they like e.g. selling to customers providing free with certain purchases providing random drawings distributed as bonuses provided as door prizes etc. .

Such feature codes could then be used to give exclusive virtual items or other bonus features to the user or they might be used to extend a user s time on the site or to give users special privileges e.g. the ability to set up a contest to provide bonus content e.g. extra virtual cash and or even used to unlock special features on the site that are not available otherwise such as new games jobs actions for the pet etc. as discussed above.

Alternatively registration codes could be passed out without any purchase but to reward some behavior or attract certain consumes with these registration codes not being related to a product but being utilized to allow new users to register on the site for certain restricted content in the virtual world but that would typically be less than the content available to a fully registered user that has purchased the required toy s .

Because not all owners of products provided with Feature Codes or recipients of free feature codes may also be currently registered users of the website it would be possible to provide those unregistered users with the ability to at least register as a Feature Code Member . These members will only have access to the features that they have unlocked with the codes they have received. The goal of this embodiment will be to capture the attention of these users encourage them to purchase additional toys so that they can formally register to enjoy everything else the website has to offer.

To allow for Feature Code members to convert their accounts into fully registered accounts the full account registration process could be modified so that it recognizes these feature code accounts to ease making them full account users. From the home page the user could go to a Home Page adapted for feature codes such as shown in the example screen shot of which includes an area for banner ads and a link to a store locator. shows an adoption center page where the user will have the opportunity to either log into their Feature Code account full account or choose to register as a limited Feature Code member.

Once logged in or registered the user could be taken to a My Features page such as shown by the example of . Here the user will be able to register their feature codes regardless of their type. Note that this page can also act as a Feature Code Collection Page as it might list all of the peripheral products and or all of the features that are currently available to unlock. Also note that users may not be required to have a feature code to register as a Feature Code member so if a user chose to do so they could register see all of the exciting features that are offered then go out and buy a Feature Code product.

Once a code has been registered that feature will be unlocked and could have a button beside its listing either Play for features providing games and activities or View for features providing virtual items . For Feature Code members the Play button would take the user to a game or activity that they can participate in. Once the game or activity is complete the user could be returned to the My Features page. The view button could take the user to a Collection Page which would display all items that the user has collected through feature codes. Because a feature code user unlike a full user has no virtual room for storing items these items cannot be used . Instead the user will receive an overview of the Feature Code process. The user can be informed that if they are not currently a full member that they will need to register as a full member by purchasing the appropriate toy for example and using its registration code before they can actually use their feature code.

The user could be permitted to self select whether or not they are already a member. Members could then be taken to a login page and then be taken to the My Features page. Non members could then be taken to the registration page for registering as a feature code member. The My Features page is thus the core of the Feature Code area. Here the user will be presented with a scrollable page of all of the unlockable features. If this page grows too long it could be broken into different sections or multiple pages.

The listing for each feature could include a graphic icon the name of the feature and a short e.g. twenty words or less description of the feature. Besides each listing could be an area in which the user will be able to type in their feature code. Once the code is entered the user would click on the Unlock button to open that feature. The code will be validated by the system and if valid the page will be updated to indicate that the feature is unlocked. In this case the code entry box will be replaced with a message that the feature is unlocked and the Unlock button will be replaced by either a Play button games activities or a View button items . These buttons can then be used to use their unlocked feature.

In this exemplary embodiment it is possible to have a limited feature code account without having a fully registered account and consequently it should be expected that many feature code members will later decide to obtain or convert to a full account so that they can have access to more of what the website has to offer. An adoption page such as the example shown in can be provided so that Feature Code Members can skip the account registration section since they are already registered as a limited member and get right to adopting their pet provided with the registration code required to obtain the fully registered account . shows a flow chart of an example process for visiting the site.

Finally a particular type of feature code an Item Code can be used to unlock special un purchasable virtual items. These codes could be particularly useful in marketing campaigns and for advertisers.

Additional examples of various features and bonuses that are tied to feature codes or more narrowly registration codes are described in the following sections.

Appendix A incorporated by reference and filed herewith provides a table applicable to the example embodiment using toys such as plush animals discussed in application Ser. No. 11 027 880. This table provides various example feature code categories listing the type of feature code and the details of the bonuses offered for that type of feature code.

For at least one example embodiment feature codes are special codes that are attached to various products that allow users to unlock various abilities features games and virtual items in an online virtual world such as discussed above. Examples of a feature codes that might be provided with a product or services as shown in the examples of D and E. These feature codes can be obtained in a manner that is discussed elsewhere in this specification.

Various help menus can be provided to aid the user in the proper use of feature and registration codes. Customer service will have access to various information about the feature codes and the users to allow additional help or to reactivate codes in special situations for example when a code was improperly used by somebody not authorized to use it and thus it went inadvertently marked as used . Various information can be made available to customer service via access to the website providing the virtual world or a unique website provided for customer service personnel.

Clicking on any of the icons on the web page can cause a pop up message to occur explaining the icon. Clicking on the Unlocked Features button can take the user to a page of features they have already unlocked but have not yet used as shown in the example screen shot of .

The user enters their feature code in the feature code box and then clicks unlock to use the code and obtain the bonus es . Feature codes can be provided that are of a certain length such as between sixteen numbers to eighteen numbers long for example. If the user enters fewer numbers in the box the unlock button is not functional. The copy at the top of the screen can be used to explain to the user how to obtain a feature code and how to use the feature code.

A Feature Code Catalogue can be displayed at the bottom of the screen. In this example embodiment the various features bonuses a user can get are divided into four categories 1 Items 2 Abilities 3 Features and 4 Downloads. If the user has unlocked a code that has not been used yet such as a download or a create your own recipe feature the user will be able to access that in an Unlocked Features area as shown in . Additional information about the features can be provided to the user as a web page such as the example screen shot of . Such a screen can provide a pop up message telling the user what feature they ve unlocked. An icon of the unlocked feature virtual cash item can be displayed in a pop up message.

If a user attempts to use a code that has already been used a system message pop up can be provided to inform them that their code has been used. Similarly if a user attempts to use a code that has been retired due to an expiration of time or the retiring of the product or bonus feature a system message will pop up and inform them that their code has been retired and is no longer valid.

A list of attributes of the features can be provided including the feature s name where to get the feature the feature s rarity and the description of the feature. Furthermore the users can be offered a preview of the feature be it an action a game a special feature virtual cash or a special virtual item . Such a preview could be provided in a pop up window in response to clicking a preview button for example.

One process for activating a bonus feature with a feature code can be as follows The user enters a feature code and clicks unlock if the system determines that the feature code is acceptable and has not been used previously the system will award the user with the feature the code unlocks. The feature the user has unlocked can be displayed in a pop up message.

Feature codes can be used to provide one or more of the various special features including the ability to unlock special pet abilities ability to walk on two legs for example provide an amount of virtual cash provide special virtual items and special promotional virtual items. A page such as that shown in can be used to display many or all of the features within a given category such as all the features in the Items category or all the features in the Abilities or Special Features or Downloads categories could be displayed depending on which category the user clicked on.

A store locator will work by the user will choosing their country state and town to see stores with the given code.

If the feature is an item an icon of the item can be shown. If the feature is a new game or unlocks features in a given game the user can be shown a short preview of the game play if the feature is virtual cash the user can be shown the virtual cash symbol if the feature is an action ability for a virtual toy the user can be shown a preview of the virtual pet performing the action. If the feature is a download the user can be shown a picture of the downloadable item.

A feature code look up tool can be provided to a customer service department to help users identify what feature codes that they have. Customer service representatives will be able to search by username user ID or feature code.

Feature codes can also be provided to customers who purchase various products online. In such a situation Feature Codes can be provided to the purchaser or user if different from the purchaser in an electronic format such as via email for example or by displaying the code in a receipt or downloading a special code for storing on a local machine or device or by some other means. The products might be provided by the same website that provides the virtual world presentation or a different website such as a retail vendor website or the seller of unrelated products.

In addition items can be placed on a wish list for later purchase. shows a screen shot of an example page showing a time that was placed in a wish list.

Once an online purchase occurs the user will be provided with the appropriate feature codes such as via an email notification. These codes can then be used to register the purchase and obtain the bonus features for use in the entertainment site.

Furthermore links to additional product vendors can be provided as well. A store locator function can be utilized to show the user which stores are close to the user s location.

As described above one item that may be purchased and used to change the appearance of the virtual item is a charm. The feature code obtained from registering the charm may provide access to a special area called the charms forest. In this embodiment the access to the special area is determined based on how many items the user has purchased. In addition there may be a non linear relation between the number of items purchased and the access provided. For example purchasing two items may provide more access than double the purchase of a single item.

The Charms Forest is a unique blend of real world product collection charms feature codes and a special online activity. By collecting a line of charms with a feature code such as a registration code hidden in the packaging of the charm for example existing members having an online account such as one obtained by previously registering a toy having a registration code such as a plush animal can use the code to unlock a special activity in a virtual world such as a magical Charms Forest where virtual charms can be collected for virtual cash and other prize bonuses for example.

The Charms Forest would be an area in the virtual world of the user which will require the purchase of one or more real world products e.g. charms to gain access to the bonus materials. The natural collection element of the product will be boosted by the virtual collection activity it will unlock for consumers the user collects both real and virtual charms . And in turn the desire for more access to the activity will drive sales for even more real world charms.

For example a Series 1 charm bracelet could feature twenty four real world collectable charms. Purchasing just one of these charms could give the consumer a registration code to unlock their access to the Charms Forest but the user would typically need an existing website membership to activate the code . Once the member unlocks the code in the feature code shop they could get a virtual charm and a Charms Forest link such as in a Things to Do menu as shown in the user s virtual room see for an example screen shot.

With each real world charm purchased the accompanying registration code could for example unlock one row of five virtual collectable charms which can be found in the Series area of the Charms Forest. There can be for example a total of eight unlockable charm rows for a total of 40 virtual collectable charms. Collecting a total of sixteen real world charms could then earn the member a special virtual item and collecting a total of twenty four real world charms could earn the member a SUPER special virtual item. In addition virtual cash and access to virtual games could be provided as well for example. Thus the purchase of additional real world charms is encouraged.

With each new bracelet series a new section in the Charms Forest can be opened up for searching with for example a new set of 40 collectable virtual charms so the activity itself can be continually expanded upon.

Collecting all five of the virtual charms in one unlocked row could for example earn the member a virtual cash bonus. For each subsequent row completed the virtual case bonus can grow. For the last four completed rows the member could earn exclusive Charms Forest virtual items as a bonus instead of or in addition to virtual cash. For collecting all 40 virtual charms the member could win a virtual trophy such as a virtual tiara that can be worn by a virtual pet as shown in for example which could animate in a simple continuous cycle for example.

Once the user member clicks on the link to the Charms Forest the user will get access to special content such as via an example a splash page as shown in the screen shot of for example which could show a top over map view of the entire Magical Charms Forest. One small highlighted section of the forest will indicate the Series area which has been opened up to search. The remainder of the forest can remain unexplored and thus unlabelled for options in future theme expansion.

To increase visitations the member can be limited on getting access to a highlighted area of the forest to search for virtual charms for limited periods such as once every six hours for example. A countdown timer can be provided on this map splash page to help the member track when next they can search.

When the member accesses an activity they can be provided for example with a ground level view from a clearing looking towards a dense magical forest of trees. There can be provided a plurality e.g. four or five of pathway openings into the trees to enter a charms forest each with a different magical design theme to them such as shown in which shows four possible paths.

Different scenarios could be utilized to provide virtual charms. For example in one possible scenario only one virtual charm from each of the eight unlockable rows could be provided down each path into the forest. Until a member buys their next real world charm they will only be able to find that one virtual charm per pathway thus potentially provided five virtual charms if there are five pathways for example . If the member buys eight real world charms for example they will be able to find up to eight virtual charms down each pathway.

The theme of each forest pathway entrance could be unique such as being tied to a different earth element. Thus for the above example each of the eight unlockable rows could have one virtual charm from each element so each row of charms will have five different elements. Members could then be required to figure out by the charms names which element each charm belongs to so they know down which pathway to search. As a further complication the pathways might not have any names but their design would instead suggest which earth element they represent adding a further element of mystery to the implementation.

Further to the above example when the member chooses a path to search they could come to another small clearing designed in the appropriate elemental theme. The member could be given the ability to look to their left or right in 180 degree panorama. Distributed along this view could be a number of different magical interactive elements e.g. four for example a Charmling Tree a door a genie in a lamp and a magic mirror.

The virtual charms themselves can be hidden inside kernels which normally grow in the Charmling Tree for example. Fairies could be made to fly up and harvest the kernels and store them in a storeroom behind the door. A magic mirror and a genie in the lamp can also grant charm kernels. Like the pearl inside a clam it could be made that not all charm kernels contain actual charms with some only containing virtual sparkling charm candy or some other gag gift or they may contain nothing at all but perhaps a magic poof .

The odds of a charm appearing in a kernel could be made constant or variable. If a fixed number of charms are available getting more charm kernels during their search increases their chances of getting one with an actual charm. Only the charms from the rows unlocked by the member can appear in their search. When the charm kernels appear the member needs to click on them in order to crack them open and reveal their interior contents.

Each one of these interactive elements could require a specific tool to interact with it. At the beginning the member might have only a single tool such as a magic wand which would only work on the fairies for example. In order to get one of the other tools the member would have to watch for randomly appearing fast moving fairies carrying little rucksacks. Clicking on the small area around the rucksack with their wand will cause them to drop a virtual item that is in the bag. The fairies could drop either a tool or a kernel for example. The fairies might for example only carry one item at a time so if they drop a kernel they will only drop one. If the fairy drops a tool the user could then use it to get access to one of the magic interactive elements which dispense slightly higher amounts of charm kernels for example.

Once a fairy drops something it could be provided that no other fairies will appear so the member will only get one item per search. Once the user picks up the tool they may need to figure out where to use it through common sense intuition or instructions for use might be provided.

Whenever the user finds a charm it could be provided that a roll of dark blue velvet will unfurl to reveal eight charm bracelets with open spaces to hook on their charms. The member with locked rows will see some of their charm bracelets grayed out and inactive. Purchasing eight real world charms will show all eight bracelets in full color. For example in between navigation buttons could be provided an image of a velvet pouch roll with a colored ribbon tied around it labeled My Charm Collection . Clicking on this will trigger a pop up showing the member s charm collection.

For example it could be provided that a member would only find one charm per search. Duplicate charms could be traded for virtual cash for example. The user could also for example keep any Sparkling Charm candy they find which might have a low virtual cash value and perhaps provide happiness and or hunger parameters for impacting the status of the virtual pet s .

There might be a certain number e.g. twenty of available fairies floating in the forest along a particular path. The fairies can be of different sizes. The user is only able to choose one by clicking on the fairy. Once the member clicks on a fairy with their wand or other device the fairy could be made to fly up close to the center of the screen and shake their own wand with a magical flourish all other buttons might be frozen out at this point . After the magical flourish the fairy could be made to disappear and be replaced with one of three results each with a different meaning.

For example if the member clicked on a bad fairy that means they have received no Pixie Pods in their search a pixie pod is an item that contains a bonus item or a gag item inside that is released when the pod is activated . If they get a single Pixie Pod that could be the only one they will get for that search. If the user gets a key they could be prompted by a system message to pick it up and use it to search the forest for one of three hidden doors with larger quantities of Pixie Pods for example. The distribution of these three options can be randomly assigned to each of the number e.g. twenty of fairies upon the member s entry to the path.

In the event the member receives a key the member could be prompted by a system message to click on it with their wand in order to pick it up. They will need to roll their key over one of three randomly hidden invisible doors in random sizes in order to make them appear. Once they have rolled over an area of the screen where a door is hidden that door will remain visible for the remainder of the search so the member would be able to reveal all three doors before choosing between them. The potential door appearance areas could for example require twelve pre designed targets.

For example the member could choose a door simply by clicking on it with their key. Once they do so the door will open with a magical flourish and disappear leaving behind a certain number of Pixie Pods. The number of Pixie Pods behind each door would likely be pre determined by a previous server database call on path entry using a certain occurrence percentage applied to each door individually so all three doors could potentially contain the same number of Pixie Pods for example .

As a further example once the number of Pixie Pods has been revealed the member could be prompted with a system message to click on them one by one to reveal what is inside with the key turning back into a wand . At this point another call could be made and what is inside each Pixie Pod will be randomly determined and recorded on the server database along with any milestone bonuses so if a server disconnect occurs afterwards the member will find those items already in their dock or in their collection the next time they log in. Since the member can t see their dock or collection during the activity all that really normally occurs on the client side is a simple interactive reveal.

To ensure that the member doesn t miss when a new charm is added a special congratulations system message flag should be added to the member s Forest Charm collection the next time it opens either within the activity or with the member s isometric room version . Since the charms are an important collection item they could be the only Pixie Pod prize item which will require this special flag. Bonuses could be awarded for collection milestones i.e. full rows of Forest Charms and also have their own unique congratulations system message flag.

The percentage chance of finding a charm inside a Pixie Pod could be made variable depending upon the number of rows the member has unlocked. Other items could also be able to be found inside the Pixie Pods with various values and percentages such as a virtual cash coin a souvenir I visited the Magical Charm Forest T Shirt Charm Candy and Sap Glop. Sap Glop is an item which has no value a gag item and cannot be removed from the activity.

The percentage probability can be assigned to each Pixie Pod individually so it could possible to find anywhere from one to five charms during a single search for example. Only charms from unlocked rows might be made available to be part of the pool of charms found down each appropriate path.

If a member already has a revealed charm in their collection after they click the OK button they could get a new system message informing them that the charm has been automatically converted into virtual cash for them.

As a further example once a Pixie Pod has been clicked on that individual Pixie Pod could be made to begin to shudder and crack open before disappearing completely and the resulting icon appearing in a message window above. Once the message window appears all other Pixie Pods will be frozen out until the member clicks the OK button to close the message window. If the member doesn t find any charms they will receive a system message telling them come back in six hours to search again. If the member has found at least one charm after opening all of their Pixie Pods clicking the final OK button will trigger a pop up unfurling a roll of dark velvet to reveal their Forest Charm collection. All new found charms could appear in the correct position. After a charm animates into the collection the user could see flagged congratulations system messages for completed rows . Members could be able to view their collection at any time in the activity when the link is not frozen out. Even if the member does not have any virtual charms they might be allowed to open up the collection interface.

Continuing with the example once a member chooses a particular path their turn will be registered as taken on that server call and the six hour countdown before their next turn will begin. An isometric version of the Charm Collection could be created for members to be viewed in their pet s room. The user could receive it in their dock when they unlock the Charm Forest activity. The isometric version of the member s collection could appear as an actual Charm Tree but when the user clicks on it the velvet roll interface will appear opened on the charms page tab with all other tabs also available for viewing . Furthermore when a visiting member opens up the isometric Charm Tree they will see the owner s collection of charms NOT the visiting member s collection.

An example screen shot of a Charm Tree is shown in . In this example the Charm Tree interface on the WEBKINZ CHARMS page tab will be a single pole on a stand with three bisecting branches of decreasing length running through three rotation knuckles. The top branch will have three spots for charms on both the left and right side. The middle branch will have two spots for charms on both the left and right side. The bottom branch will have one spot for a charm on both the left and right side. This means that at any one time the most the charms the member can see on the tree is twelve. However by clicking on the top rotation knob button interface they can rotate the tree to show their other twelve charms. Clicking on the rotation knob simply switches the displayed Webkinz Charms from a View A to a View B .

Initially charms could be added to the charm tree in the first available open space searching left to right top to bottom checking View A before moving on to View B . However members will inevitably want to have the ability to re arrange the charms on the tree. Thus the member could have the ability to simply click and drag their charm icons to any of the other target areas and have them hook on there instead. If another charm already occupies that target it will be switched out and moved to the empty space where the other charm was dragged from. Under the Charm Tree will be three squares titled WEBKINZ CHARM BONUSES . Each square will show one of the three milestone bonuses the member receives for collecting eight sixteen and twenty four Webkinz Charms. Once each of these milestones has been reached the corresponding square will change color to green. To the right of the Charm Tree will be an interface where members can click and drag charms they ve collected to be worn on a necklace around their virtual pet picture s neck. Above this interface is the instructional text titled CHARM YOUR PET with the main text reading Click and drag charms from the Charm Tree to the squares below the pet picture to see your pet wearing the charms you ve collected Maximum 3 . Below the instructional text will be the pet picture in the same size as the one in the member s dock except with a chain necklace around its neck. Three dock squares appear under the pet picture where member can click and drag their charm icons. Dropping a charm icon in one of the squares will create a duplicate copy in the square and another smaller copy appears on one of three locations on the chain around the pet s neck. All of the same switching rules apply but at any time if the member wants to quickly clear out their selection a CLEAR CHARMS button interface will appear under these dock squares. Once the member closes the Charm Collection interface their Charm dressing choices will be registered and the same chain and charms will appear on the member s regular dock pet picture. Members will not be able to rotate their Charm Tree or move Charms to View B until they have collected more than twelve Webkinz Charms. Once members have collected more than twelve charms they can move them to View B by clicking and dragging them over the rotation knob. Dragging a Webkinz Charm icon over the rotation knob button interface target area automatically rotates the Charm Tree from View A to View B and vice versa. The switching rules still apply with the view remaining wherever the member finally drops the icon. Once the member collects more than twelve Webkinz Charms they will also see the text CLICK TOP KNOB TO ROTATE CHARM TREE COLLECTION with two rotation arrows appearing above their Charm Tree. Clicking and dragging the Charm icons simply creates a 50 transparent copy until an end destination has been determined.

Trading Cards Trading cards also discussed above can be provided based on many of the features toys etc. that are provided to the user. Cards might also be used to represent sports figures special games etc. These cards provide a collectable retail product based on the retail toys and the online features. In addition online versions of games can be provided that utilize virtual versions of playing cards that may be the same or different than the cards sold retail.

The concepts described herein are not limited to the use with plush animals or even toys. These concepts could be provided to various types of products such as figurines adult collectibles sports products games etc. Two additional examples follow 

Recruit a Warrior A user can purchase a retail figurine of a warrior. An included registration code can then allow the user to recruit that warrior to their stable of fighters e.g. additional virtual warriors some of which may have been obtained using a registration code from a retail purchased figurine and some of which might have been purchased online . The user can the then train the virtual warriors using techniques discussed elsewhere in this document e.g. via purchase features codes or additional techniques such as training activities for example . These warriors can be used for dueling and battles against other virtual warriors owned by other users for example or used in games etc. in a manner similar to the examples discussed above.

Sports Activities A user can purchase a retail figurine or other product representing an actual or fantasy sports figure or a pack of cards such as baseball cards football cards etc. where actual players and or professional teams might be featured for example . A registration code included with the purchased product can be used to add one or more virtual players based on the purchased figurine or cards to the user s team roster and or add the player type to the user s available virtual players e.g. purchase a Quarterback figure and the user could be provided a code to unlock the Star Quarterback position for the user s team . Cards and associated registration code s might be used to make whole teams available for example.

Warriors Players and or Teams can all be traded and or sold to other user site members using their respective sites. For example this could allow a master trainer to build an ultimate warrior and then sell it to another user who does not wish to put the effort into training. Similarly a user could build a championship sports team using the virtual sports figures and could sell it to a new owner who just wants to start at the top. Users could trade various virtual players to obtain specific needed skills for their teams for example to improve their teams.

The virtual sports teams could then be used to play virtual games against other users having similar virtual sports teams with the various virtual players having different skill levels based on the activities the user used to build up his player s skill levels. Thus users who spend the time and effort to build up their players skills might win more games for example and those that don t do as well might trade for or purchase other players to improve their virtual teams or provide training to their players to improve the players individual skills .
