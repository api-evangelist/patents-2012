The present application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 275 341 filed on Oct. 18 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 244 851 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to applications for enabling users to access a large pool of contacts in order to make further connections.

Conventional social network sites provide an interface for friends and relatives to be in communication some professional social networking sites such as LinkedIn are frequently used to communicate with peers and business executives. But a personal network is an underutilized asset although it is valuable. However gathering personal connections of individual users in a common pool of contact to create a fast extended pool of contact list which is available to all the users are quite valuable and highly utilized particularly in business development recruitment purpose and other such related activities.

In today s business environment sales are done mainly by the sales people and to some extend by the key account managers. Cold calling is still one of the main ways to contact a prospect. Yet the effectiveness of cold calling is low as the conversion rates of these calls to business meetings do not raise to the desired levels.

A sales person can increase significantly the chances of obtaining a business meeting from the first call if he she is introduced prior to the targeted contact. An introduction or simply the possibility to refer to a common known person transfers the credibility of that person to the salesperson and facilitates the business discussions with the targeted contact. However the present system does not provide any solution to effectively use the referral system from the users know to the contact prior to the communication. Especially in large organizations when meeting a client or prospect it is necessary to know not only what has been discussed with this client before but which employees have connections with the prospect. This invention gives you an instant view of which person within your organization and your network knows the people you are going to meet or the person that you target to meet. These connections can give you the right introduction thereby making cold calling redundant.

Also in the present system experiences sales persons are significantly contributing towards lead generation and thereby growth of the company. However there is a need to develop a system where each and every employee of an organization can significantly contribute to the growth of the company. For example the present system allows a trainee or a junior person in a company to contribute significantly by sharing his her contacts of interest for the company from his external sources such as Facebook Linkedin etc. Each employee s contribution to the common pool of contacts of the company substantially increases pool of hot leads for the growth of the company. Also the system of the present invention generates a motivational factor among the employees of the company that they contribute more hands on to the development and growth of their company.

Also there is a need for a tool which integrates with the available business applications of the company so as to improve the contact management more effectively.

The conventional systems also do not provide an interface to get notification about the desired contact when available.

Thus there is a need for a method and system that addresses the above mentioned problems and which is easy to use less time consuming and provide a single common networking interface for effective contact sharing and contact management among all the users.

The present invention relates to a method and system for contacts management and an interface application for managing and sharing electronic contact information of users of a group. In a variant the system comprises 

electronic contacts of one user from different external sources to be shared with all the users of the entire group or with selected users of subgroups such as users of a department or specific team of an organization or users of small organizations or daughter companies of a larger conglomerate or the like wherein the different external sources are social network sources or address book of email accounts and mobile phones or business applications or other contact databases of the user 

an interface configured to download all the electronic contacts shared by the user from the external sources into the contact management interface application wherein the interface for downloading contacts is configured to download all the electronic contacts of all the users of the application from the external sources and all the downloaded contacts are automatically merged before displayed in the common pull of contacts an interface configured to merge the downloaded electronic contacts from the different external sources shared by the user in the contact management interface application wherein the application is configured to display the user s contacts gathered and merged by the contact management interface application from all the external sources linked to the user 

an interface configured to share a selected set of the merged electronic contacts of the user with all the users or among the selected users of the subgroups and place them into a common pool of shared contacts of other users of the contact management interface application wherein the sharing interface is configured to permit sharing and displaying the selected set of the merged electronic contacts with other selected users of the group is controlled by the user and the interface application is configured to provide the user an option to select which contacts from the external sources are shared and displayed into the common pool of contacts wherein degree of the display of the shared contacts in the interface is controlled by the user wherein the degree of the display comprises an option to display a contact s attributes in a search result without displaying who the contact is connected to another option to display the contact s attributes and the user the contact is linked to and further another option not to display the contact at all in any search 

a searching interface configured to search for specific contacts from the common pool of contacts based on search criteria entered by the user and configured to serve as a management interface to permit users to manage their specific contacts wherein the searching interface provides the user with the option to conduct keyword based searching of contacts based on their attributes stored in the contact management interface application 

an access interface configured to provide access to all the users of the group to identify and display connectivity information between the electronic contacts and the users to all the users of the group and display the external source from which the electronic contact has been received from in order to facilitate an introduction or communication between the user and the electronic contact 

an interface configured to add the electronic contacts and their attributes from the common pool of contacts of the contact management interface application into a business application wherein the contacts to be added can match with contacts stored in the business application and where the information about who knows the electronic contact within the group is highlighted in the business application wherein the business application includes a customer relationship management CRM application of the group and wherein the merging of the electronic contacts from the contact management interface with the contacts from the CRM applications is done automatically or manually by the user and

a watchlist interface to notify the user as soon as a new contact of interest or a new link to a contact established by any user of the contact management interface application is available wherein the watchlist interface allows the user to add the target contact or target company to the watchlist to receive alerts via email alerts or message alert as soon as new electronic contacts or a new link to a contact established by any user is available among the users of the group of the contact management interface application.

It is an objective of the present invention to provide a better and bigger common contacts management networking interface in an organization so as to boost sales and growth of the organization by using the increased shared contacts in the interface.

It is another objective of the present invention is to provide better common contacts management sharing interface to share personal contacts of every employee to the common interface and contribute to the success of their organization simply by increasing the contacts pool of the organization.

It is another objective of the present invention is to provide an organizational common contacts management referral interface to share an instant view of which person within the organization and in the network knows the person to be contacted so as to provide the right introduction or referral before contacting the desired person and thereby making cold calling redundant.

It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a common contacts management interface for multiple companies to collaborate and complement each other and share their gathered connection base with the common communication interface so as to get mutual benefit from each other via the common communication interface. For an example smaller companies or daughter companies of a larger conglomerate can take the advantage of the common communication interface.

It is still another objective of the present invention is to provide an access to the users to strengthen their network by having an overview of their contacts and their distribution on different platforms and by having the possibility to connect with their contacts on new platforms.

It is still further another objective of the present invention to provide the advantage of the above objectives of the present invention and to assist growth in CRM or ERP application industries recruitment purpose or job consulting companies match making or matrimony institutions or any such type of industries.

Description in terms of these environments is provided to allow the various features and embodiments of the invention to be portrayed in the context of an exemplary application. After reading this description it will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art how the invention can be implemented in different and alternative environments.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents applications published applications and other publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. If a definition set forth in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a definition set forth in applications published applications and other publications that are herein incorporated by reference the definition set forth in this document prevails over the definition that is incorporated herein by reference.

A contacts management interface application of the present invention herein after referred as Group Networking Connector GNC acts as a system a method and a technical solution to be used by a group of persons who share their electronic contacts and connections from different external sources such as social networks address books of email accounts and mobile phones applications and other contact databases into a common pool of electronic contacts thereby facilitating all the users of the group to take benefit from this extended network of contacts available to the entire group wherein all the users have a preexisting connection between each other within the group.

In an embodiment of the invention the users as defined in the invention are the persons who use the GNC system to share their contacts or connections from different sources such as but not limited to social network sources or social media websites like Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Skype etc or address books of email accounts and mobile phones or business applications or other contact databases of the user into the GNC system within a group of users and who use the GNC system to retrieve information about the contacts and connections of all users from that group. Each user of the GNC system may be part of a group or multiple subgroups with which the user shares the user s contacts within the GNC. Further the users are connected to part of one or multiple subgroups of a group of users within the GNC which allows the users of the subgroup to perform different operations within the subgroup. The subgroup of a group may be described as users of a department or specific team of an organization or users of small organizations or daughter companies of a larger conglomerate or the like for example several users can belong to the subgroup Sales Team which is a subgroup of a company. Users from the subgroup Sales Team can decide to share certain electronic contacts only within the Sales Team subgroup and thus those electronic contacts will not be visible to the other users members of the company.

In an embodiment of the invention as shown in the contact management interface application or the GNC where the user can decide which are the external sources from which the user wants to download electronic contacts into the GNC and where the user can view and manage the user s merged contacts from the different external sources before sharing them in the common pool of contacts of the GNC . In an example the user can decide to selectively share contacts from specific external sources and not from all the sources the user is using. For example the user can decide to share contacts from the user s email address book mobile phone LinkedIn connections into the GNC with the other users but do not prefer to share the user s connections or contacts from the user s Facebook source.

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in a Shared Network Interface is provided where the user has access to all the merged electronic contacts their attributes and the connectivity information and associated with the contacts from all the users of the GNC of the group and the contacts from all the external sources shared by the users within the GNC . The GNC system enables a user to share his her electronic contacts from different external sources within a group and at the same time gain access to the information related to the electronic contacts and shared by all other users from the group of interest he she is part of thus creating a common pool of electronic contacts available to the entire group as described in .

In another embodiment of the invention each user has access to the user s GNC account based on a unique username and password and can see besides the user s electronic contacts from different sources also the electronic contacts shared by the other users from the group or groups the user is part of as shown in . As described in the user needs to login to each of the selected external source or web servers and provides acceptance for the application interface of the GNC to read through application programming interface API services specific data from the user s accounts on different external sources and to import contacts and their attributes on the servers of the GNC .

After the initial automated import of the contacts in the GNC system the GNC system automatically and periodically updates the information using API services collected from the external sources by importing new information such as new contacts from the external sources into the GNC and by updating existing information or attributes of the contacts in the GNC as and when updated on the external sources . For example if a contact of a user has changed the contact s position company information on any professional network such as LinkedIn the contact will be automatically and periodically updated in the GNC . Additional to the usage of API services for external sources for which API services are not available the user can export the user s contacts from the external source and import them manually by using several file formats such as but not limited to txt xls or csv files through a dedicated interface in the GNC system as illustrated in .

As described in the contact merging interface of the GNC automatically merges the information from different contact lists of the user available on the different external sources in response to an action by the user to share the selected contacts within the GNC system . Based on different matching criteria GNC finds the contacts which appear on multiple external sources . The contacts downloaded or imported from the external sources are matched against each other to remove the duplicates so as to ensure high accuracy of the match and effective merging of contacts as suggested in the automated merge and match step .

For example a contact can be matched between LinkedIn and Facebook by name and surname between email accounts by email only between professional networks by name surname and company etc. As a result of the merge of contacts from different sources each contact appears as a unique record in the GNC contact management interface of that specific user .

As shown in all contacts of a user which are merged and downloaded into the GNC the user can access them in the user s dedicated contact management interface application GNC . In one interface the user has an overview of all the user s contacts from different external sources and where the user can perform different operations before sharing the contacts into the common pool of contacts of the group.

Further the contact management interface application or the GNC provides additional information to the user for each merged contact in the GNC available to the user. The system displays information with all external sources from which the contact was imported and with all contact attributes such as but not limited to name surname email phone numbers company position past employers interests hobbies etc. gathered from external sources related to the contact . Further the user can view all contact related information gathered from different external sources and search by different criteria such as but not limited to contact details professional details or interest hobbies etc. The GNC allows the user to modify the information displayed in the interface for example the user can modify the title position or company or other attributes of a contact if for example the user knows that the information on the different social networks is outdated.

In another embodiment of the invention connectivity information of the contacts and their attributes such as but not limited to any information stored about the electronic contacts on different external sources and shared by the users within the GNC system or information available on different sources available to the user because of the user s connection with the contact. For example information may include professional information about a LinkedIn connection like company job title company size etc or interests hobbies information of a Facebook friend or information shared by the user within the GNC system. The user can see which users from the group know a certain contact of interest to the user and from which external source.

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in and . the user can also modify the automated match and merge of the contacts done by the GNC where the merge interface of the GNC displays all the information for the contact searched and found by the user also the interface displays the networks where no contact was found for the contact searched by the user. The user can select the contact for which the user wants to match additional account information and the user can select contacts that the user wants to display differently in the GNC application interface . The user selects and modifies the alias information or the information decided by the user to be displayed in the GNC application interface for that contact. For example the user might identify that the same contact appears as two different contacts or records in the GNC as this person uses different names on the user s social networks and as such was not detected by the system as one record or contact. In a dedicated interface the user can access one of the records and can manually match the contact from a social network with the contact from another social network and thus moving forward this person will be displayed as one record in the GNC. As displayed in the flow chart of and the GNC displays two records Andrei P on LinkedIn and Andrei Postoaca on Facebook prior to the merge of the contacts but after the match only one record is displayed for the contact and is displayed as decided by the user as Andrei P. in the GNC.

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in the GNC provides an interface to each user allowing the users to cross invite each contact between different networks in order to strengthen the user s own relation with these contacts. As shown in the application will detect networks where the user is connected with the contact networks where there are possible matches for the contact but the user is not connected with the contact and networks where there are no matches for the contact. In the case where the application interface detects network the user can view the full profile of the contact on the network . If the application interface detects network the user can view the possible matches for the contact on the network with a preview on the profile information for each contact in the network and the user is allowed to select the record that matches with the contact and is redirected to network to connect with the contact. However if the application interface detects network the user can request the contact via a customized email from the application to recommend the network .

For example the system may detect that user is connected with a contact on Facebook but not on LinkedIn. Or the application will display persons from the user s mobile phone contacts who have a social network account. In those cases the system is configured to suggest the user to become a friend or otherwise connected with these contacts on the different social networks. Further the GNC interface allows the user to see for each contact which are the external sources where the user is already connected with the contact and which are the other external sources where the contact has an account but the user is not connected with the contact. Additionally for the networks where the user is already connected to the contact from the Network Management Interface the user can be redirected to the full profile of the contact on the chosen external sources. For example if the user clicks on the Facebook icon next to the contact the user will be redirected to the profile page of the contact on Facebook as shown in .

In another exemplary embodiment of the invention where the user is not connected with the contact of the different networks or external sources the system automatically detects based on the attributes of the contact stored in the specific network which accounts might belong to the contact. The system might detect just one possible match case in which by clicking on the icon of the network the user is redirected to the profile of the contact and can invite the contact to become a connection on this network.

If there are multiple account matches suggested by the system for a contact multiple accounts with the same name the user is redirected to the social network site showing the search results with all the matches for that name and surname and with the additional profile information picture city company etc so that the user can choose the correct one and connect with the contact on that social network as illustrated in and .

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in the interface for sharing contacts within the GNC permits sharing of the selected set of the merged electronic contacts with other selected users of the group. The sharing is controlled by the user and the interface application is configured to provide the user an option to select which contacts from the external sources are shared with other users from the common pool of contacts of the GNC. Also the interface allows the user to have full control and actively decide the way of sharing for example whether to disclose the user s identity or not while sharing the contacts with other users is decided by the user the selected contacts with other users of the user s interest. For an example the user can decide to share contacts in a differentiated way within the group such as there can be some contacts the user wants to share with all group users for example with all employees in the company who are using the GNC and other contacts which are to be shared only with certain sub groups only with a specific team or subgroup such as the sales and marketing team or between the management board of the company etc .

In another exemplary embodiment of the invention GNC users belonging to a group for example belonging to a Company A which is the company they work in can see in one interface all the connections of all employees of company A on different social networks even though not all these employees are necessarily also connected to each other on different social networks and thus they do not all have access to all connections friends of each other on the different social networks they are part of. In the same way in case of email address books and mobile phone address books or other sources GNC provides a system through which a user can simultaneously and in an easy way to share contacts from the external sources with the other users who do not have access to the user s email account mobile phone and other sources.

In another exemplary embodiment of the invention a user X working in a company A being part of a networking group B and of a professional association C will be able to share X s electronic contacts among the users of A B and C provided the users of these groups also use the GNC to share their contacts. In this example the members of each group will see all the electronic contacts of user X as well as all the electronic contacts shared by the other users from the group. Users belonging to networking group B will see the gathered connections of all members of this networking group and members of professional association C will see all the gathered connections of all members of this association and same for company A. User X who belongs to all the three groups and who has shared the X s electronic contacts within all the three groups will see the gathered connections contacts of all the members users from all the groups A B and C. When looking for a person of interest to X the user X will see that this electronic contact is known for example by user Y who is a member of the networking group B as well as by person Z who is an employee in the company A.

In another exemplary embodiment of the invention as shown in the user can control display of contact information about the shared contacts and their connectivity information to the other users of the GNC. Several display options of contact information about the shared contacts and their connectivity information is available with the present GNC system such as VISIBLE INVISIBLE and CONFIDENTIAL however other display options can be configured depending on the need without departing from the scope of the invention. In the VISIBLE display option contact is visible to the group and or subgroups and all the users of the group subgroup has full access to the information about the contact as well as the connectivity information such as name of the user in the group who is connected to this contact and through which external sources such as Facebook Linkedin Gmail etc. The external sources by which the contact is connected are displayed to all the users of the GNC. In the INVISIBLE display option contact is invisible to all the other users of the group subgroup such that no information about the contact or the connectivity information is shared with the other users of the GNC application. In the CONFIDENTIAL display option connectivity information of the contacts is kept confidential such that other users from the group subgroup can see the information available about the contact e.g. name company title etc. and they can see that someone in the group knows this contact and from which external sources but they do not see the identity of this user . They can contact the user through the application interface and the user can decide whether the user wants to reveal the user s identity to them or not in order to facilitate a meeting or introduction between the user requesting an introduction and the contact connection of the user who shared the contact as confidential with the other users. Further the user can also define for each attribute of a contact whether the user wants to make the attribute visible or not in the GNC. For example the user can decide to share a contact with its name position company source of connection but not the email and the phone number of the contact . The user can also define other connectivity information for each contact such as the degree to which the user is acquainted with the contact where the user knows the contact from what kind of relation they have last date the user met or interacted with the contact etc as well as other relevant information and additional comments the user wants to share related to the contact.

In another embodiment of the invention the search interface as illustrated in provides shared network or extended group network to all its users where all the electronic contacts of all users from a group are available and searchable to all users from the specific group containing information about the contacts their attributes and their connectivity information . The user can search for specific persons companies by titles by interest hobbies and by any other information or attributes available and shared about these contacts in the common pool of contacts of the GNC. The user identifying the desired contact can additionally view the other connectivity information of the contact with other users and of the GNC so as to choose and request the suitable user to facilitate an introduction or referral. For example for a targeted company the user sees all contacts that work or have worked at the specific company which users and from the group know the contacts or have themselves worked for the company how well they know the contacts and other such connectivity information . For example the users can see that user X knows a contact A because user X is connected to the contact on Facebook while user Y is connected to the same contact on LinkedIn and user Z has the contact A in the user s mobile phone book. Additionally each user can describe for each contact how well he she knows the contact and add any additional information about the relationship with the contact. Thus a user of the GNC interested in contact A can decide to contact user Z to obtain an introduction or a referral for contact A because user Z knows the contact A very well while user X and Y have indicated that they don t know contact A very well.

If a first user finds the desired contact in the GNC and identifies that the desired contact has good connection with a second GNC users then the first user can request from another user or for an introduction or referral prior to communication with the desired contact so as to facilitate easy and effective communication. The second user or knowing the contact can reject or accept the request. In the case where the user connected to the contact has established that the user s identity is confidential in the GNC i.e. the user who wants an introduction to the contact sees that another user of the GNC knows the contact but the user does not see the user s identity contact details the two users can still communicate through the system as described in the flow chart of the FIG. ..

In another embodiment of the invention if the user doesn t find the targeted contact or company in the GNC or does not have a good connection to this contact or the GNC users do not know the contact very well or they reject the request to facilitate an introduction to the contact then the user can add the targeted contact company etc to a watchlist as shown in . The user will be alerted or notified as soon as a new contact company of interest or a new link to a contact established by any user of the contact management interface application is available wherein the watchlist interface allows the user to add the target contact or target company or desired attributes to the watchlist to receive alerts via email alerts or message alert as soon as new electronic contacts or a new link to a contact established by any user is available as shown in interface of among the users of the GNC.

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in the flow chart depicts the operability of the GNC application to be integrated with business applications like customer relationship management applications CRMs or enterprise resource planning applications ERPs etc. At a company level for example through application programming interface API usage or through transfer of information between the business application and the GNC by automatic import and export of contact information through a secure file transfer protocol sftp site or any manual or automatic way of data transfer between the business application and the GNC the information from the GNC can be matched and merged with the information from the business application and information can be transferred from one system to another thereby adding the electronic contacts and their attributes from the common pool of contacts of the contact management interface application GNC into the business application. The contacts to be added can match with contacts stored in the business application and connectivity information such as who knows the electronic contact within the group of the contact may be highlighted in the business application. For the shared contacts in the GNC that do not match with contacts from the business application the user can search the contact in the GNC application and upon identifying the contact the user can add the contact into the business application either manually or automatically via the interface. If the contact is not available in the GNC application then the user can add the prospect or contact to a watchlist so that the contact will be added to the business applications as soon as the user gets notification about availability of the contact.

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in for the shared contacts in the GNC that do not match with contacts from the CRM system the user sees them in the GNC system in the common pool of contacts are indicated by an icon for example a icon available left of the contact name which implies that they are not available in the CRM system and by clicking on the icon the user can add the contacts automatically with all their information as prospects in the CRM. By clicking the icon the user will automatically create a new company a new contact and a new task in the CRM application and all the information from the GNC company name contact name position other attributes and the connectivity information will be visible and searchable in the CRM system.

In another embodiment of the invention as shown in instead of automatically adding the contacts into the business application as new records new company new contact etc by using the icon the user can go through an intermediary interface for manually matching and merging the contacts from the GNC with the contacts from the business application in case the user suspects that these contacts already exists in the business application but under a different name. For example in the interface of the GNC application where the user sees Ana Maria M which the user knows from Facebook and Ana Maria M. Linkedin but the user has a third column containing the CRM information where the user can search through the contacts stored in the CRM and find that there is already a contact Ana M . Thus the user manually matches Ana Maria M and from the GNC with Ana M contact in the CRM and the system will know and transmit to the CRM that Ana Maria M and from the GNC and Ana M from the CRM are the same person.

In another exemplary embodiment of the invention a sales team using a CRM for managing their prospects or potential clients clients etc and the GNC for sharing their contacts from different sources between each other each member of the sales team will be able to see for all clients and potential clients introduced in the CRM system which are the ones to which there is a connection available through the other users such as which of their colleagues know the prospects potential clients and clients and through which external sources. As shown in a CRM where a sales person usually has an interface with all the user s clients prospects potential clients the user is targeting where the user can find the network connectivity information about the client . The user can see how many people in the GNC know the prospect from different external sources. If the user clicks on a prospect the user also sees the details about the connectivity information the prospect so that the user can ask for an introduction or referral. The business application interface also provides an option to add specific contacts or companies into the watchlist if there is no connection or no good connection to the specific contact or company through another user. In another example for searching client or prospected companies in case a sales person is targeting a company which the user introduced in the CRM system as a prospect the user will see which of the user s colleagues have a connection to this company and which contact persons they know at the targeted company.

In another exemplary embodiment of the invention where a first user introduces a contact as a prospect in the CRM system and the contact is displayed as INVISIBLE in the network GNC but there is a second user of the GNC who has this contact in the user s network but has not shared it with the first user the second user of the GNC will be informed by the system that the first user is targeting the contact as a prospect and the second user knowing the contact can decide to contact the first user and let him know that the user is connected to the contact.

In another embodiment of the invention the GNC interface application can also be used by a group of companies such as smaller companies or daughter companies of a larger conglomerate to have the option to share their connections in order to multiply a lead generation effect. For example CEO s of different companies can decide to join the connection pools of their companies in which a user of the GNC system from company A can see that someone in the partner company B knows a contact the user is targeting but the user cannot see the identity of this user then the user may ask the user in company B for an introduction to this contact.
