Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use OFDM modulation for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node or eNodeB to the wireless device or UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

A wireless device can include a human oriented wireless device e.g. human operated wireless device a machine type communication MTC device and or a machine to machine M2M device. The human operated wireless device can include a computing device configured with a interface to be operated by a human operator capable of wireless digital communication such as a smart phone a tablet computing device a laptop computer a multimedia device such as an iPod Touch or other type computing device that provides text or voice communication. A MTC or M2M device can include a sensor and or a processor configured to automatically access and communicate wirelessly with a RAN. As used herein MTC and M2M may be used interchangeably.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The machine type communication MTC can provide various types of services and automated connectivity via a wireless network. As various services expand and connectivity increases a larger number of MTC devices may be connected to the network. Many MTC devices can be characterized by a low data rate infrequent transmissions and very low power consumption. In some examples MTC devices can also be a low cost device. The factors associated with MTC devices can significantly differentiate the MTC devices from traditional human oriented devices. In an example both communication device types e.g. the human oriented devices and the MTC devices can seamlessly operate in one wireless network or RAN . Some wireless communication systems can be designed to optimize performance mainly for human type of communications and thus those wireless communication systems may not optimally accommodate MTC specific requirements. The efficient support of MTC devices can include additional features to wireless networks designed for human oriented wireless devices to provide optimization for MTC devices as well as human oriented wireless devices.

In an example the MTC devices can include low cost GSM GPRS terminals or low cost LTE terminals where GSM is an acronym for Global System for Mobile Communications originally Groupe Sp cial Mobile and GPRS is an acronym for general packet radio services. In an example a significant portion of the cost of a wireless device can be the components used to support a wide signal bandwidth. Since many MTC devices do not have a high peak throughput requirement reducing a maximum bandwidth supported by MTC devices can be beneficial from a cost reduction perspective. For example the LTE specification can support a scalable set of signal bandwidths e.g. 1.4 3 5 10 15 and 20 megahertz MHz and some wireless devices e.g. higher cost devices can support the entire set of signal bandwidths while other wireless devices e.g. lower cost devices may only support some of the signal bandwidths e.g. low bandwidth .

As many of the human oriented wireless devices accessing the wireless network can have high data rates wireless network specifications such as the LTE specification may eliminate operation of narrow bandwidth e.g. 1.4 and 3 MHz devices e.g. MTC devices used for lower data rate in the wideband e.g. 10 and 20 MHz legacy network to optimize data rates for wide bandwidth devices. A limitation that can restrict operation of narrow bandwidth wireless devices in legacy networks can come from a wideband transmission of control channels in downlink. For example the physical downlink control channel PDCCH can be used to perform resource assignment within a subframe distributed over a full system bandwidth so the wireless devices are to decode the PDCCH before receiving the assigned data resource. Additionally a physical control format indicator channel PCFICH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request hybrid ARQ indicator channel PHICH can also be transmitted in a wide band distributed over a whole signal bandwidth. The control region for a downlink subframe can include the PCFICH the PHICH and the PDCCH. The transmission of the control region channels in a wideband e.g. 10 MHz can complicate or make receiving the control region channels difficult for narrow bandwidth devices e.g. devices operating with 1.4 MHz . Narrow band control channels can facilitate reception of control information by narrow bandwidth devices.

In one example the PDCCH can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical PHY layer in a downlink transmission between a node e.g. eNodeB and the wireless device e.g. UE using a generic long term evolution LTE frame structure as illustrated in .

Each wireless device may use at least one signal bandwidth carrier bandwidth or component carrier CC as illustrated in . For example the LTE CC bandwidths can include 1.4 MHz 3 MHz 5 MHz 10 MHz 15 MHz and 20 MHz . The 1.4 MHz CC can include 6 RBs comprising 72 subcarriers. The 3 MHz CC can include 15 RBs comprising 180 subcarriers. The 5 MHz CC can include 25 RBs comprising 300 subcarriers. The 10 MHz CC can include 50 RBs comprising 600 subcarriers. The 15 MHz CC can include 75 RBs comprising 900 subcarriers. The 20 MHz CC can include 100 RBs comprising 1200 subcarriers.

The legacy PDCCH can have capacity constraints that prevent efficient operation of modern signal processing techniques e.g. MU MIMO and enhanced features such as coordinated multipoint CoMP and carrier aggregation. The enhanced PDCCH channel ePDCCH can be added to improve performance characteristics of PDCCH. In an example the ePDCCH can be transmitted in a frequency division multiplexing FDM mode i.e. occupy part of a wide bandwidth . The ePDCCH can also support operations of narrow bandwidth wireless devices e.g. MTC devices in a legacy wireless network accommodating wide bandwidth devices if configured for localized transmission modes.

Technology e.g. methods and systems can be used to enable the coexistence of narrow bandwidth wireless devices e.g. MTC devices with regular wide bandwidth wireless device e.g. human oriented devices and terminals in a wide bandwidth wireless network that can allow access and communication by low cost narrow bandwidth wireless devices. A localized transmission of the control channels e.g. ePDCCH within a narrow bandwidth device region NBDR can support the operation of narrow bandwidth devices in wider bandwidth networks with arbitrary bandwidth configurations.

As previously discussed illustrates a subframe structure used in the LTE technology. The basic LTE frame format supports scalable spectrum allocations e.g. 1.4 MHz 3 MHz 5 MHz 10 MHz 15 MHz and 20 MHz as illustrated in . The available spectrum can be divided into physical resource blocks PRBs and composed of 12 subcarriers each with 15 kHz subcarrier spacing e.g. 6 15 25 50 75 100 PRBs respectively .

Two types of logical NBDRs can include a primary NBDR and secondary NBDRs . The NBDRs can be overlaid on top of the legacy PDSCH region and can be transparent to the wide bandwidth wireless device e.g. a legacy UE communicating with the wireless network which are not using the NBDRs i.e. the NBDRs may not interfere with wide bandwidth wireless device operation . The two types of regions e.g. primary NBDR PNBDR and secondary NBDRs SNBDRs can be used to preserve an existing system capacity to allow for multiple simultaneously supported narrow bandwidth devices.

In an example the primary NBDR PNBDR can be allocated to a narrow bandwidth located in a central part of the spectrum for the wide bandwidth subframe. The primary NBDR can provide initial system information to narrow bandwidth devices which can include legacy system information previously described as well as relevant information for support of narrow bandwidth devices such as a number of NBDRs in the available bandwidth an allocation of NBDRs an assignment of NBDRs a configuration of NBDRs or NBDRs frequency hopping pattern. In an example the primary NBDR can also include NBDR configuration information. The NBDR configuration information can indicate to the narrow bandwidth wireless device the logical narrow bandwidth region e.g. NBDR that the narrow bandwidth wireless device can use to communicate with the node e.g eNodeB via control messaging. The NBDR configuration information can be provided by a physical control channel e.g. ePDCCH PBCH or newly defined or existing DL control channel located in the central part of spectrum or upper layer signaling e.g. radio resource control RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling media access control MAC signaling . In an example the primary NBDR can also be used for data transmission or data communication between a narrow bandwidth wireless device and the node if additional resources in the primary NBDR are available data besides synchronization system and configuration information .

In an example the secondary NBDRs SNBDRs can be used for data transmission or data communication between a narrow bandwidth wireless device and the node. Multiple secondary NBDRs can increase system capacity in terms of the number of narrow bandwidth wireless devices e.g. low cost wireless devices that can be simultaneously served by the wireless network in the subframes . In an example the use of the secondary NBDRs can be optional. The configuration and allocation of secondary NBDR can be provided dynamically or semi statically to wireless devices in the primary NBDR physical layer signaling e.g. ePDCCH PBCH or newly defined or existing DL control channel located in the central part of spectrum or upper layer signaling e.g. radio resource control RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling media access control MAC signaling . In another example the configuration and allocation of secondary NBDR may be explicitly specified in specification for each bandwidth configuration. In an example each secondary NBDR may include a control channel e.g. ePDCCH or other control channel specifically designed for operation of narrow bandwidth devices for scheduling allocations in the secondary NBDR. Alternatively resource allocation information can be transmitted in the primary NBDR. In an example to reduce or preserve narrow bandwidth transmission to a wireless device e.g. switching between the primary NBDR and the secondary NBDR the time frequency resources can be assigned for the consecutive subframes.

Both the primary NBDR and secondary NBDRs can be configured to transmit data via a data channel i.e. PDSCH . With the NBDR overlay the legacy PDCCH still can provide control information to a data allocation in a PDSCH for the wide bandwidth wireless device while the NBDRs can provide control information and data to the wide bandwidth wireless device. Primary NBDR can transmit initial information on a configuration of the NBDRs. The secondary NBDR configuration information can be provided in primary NBDRs or secondary NBDRs using RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling or MAC signaling transmitted in the PDSCH. In another example resource allocation control signaling for the secondary NBDR may also be transmitted in the primary NBDR.

In another configuration the NBDR in the frame structure can receive control information via the ePDCCH which can be transmitted in a frequency division duplexing FDM mode and or can be configured for localized transmission. The ePDCCH or other control channel with similar functionality may include control information for pointing to an allocation for the corresponding NBDRs as well as providing allocation within the NBDR. Alternatively the allocation of narrow bandwidth devices corresponding to NBDRs can be assigned using upper layer control signaling e.g. RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling or MAC signaling . Upper layer control signaling higher layer signaling and or MAC control elements can be transmitted in either the primary NBDR or secondary NBDR. The signaling can be used for the NBDRs configuration in LTE frame structure i.e. information of the NBDRs positions and or patterns or a semi static assignment of secondary NBDRs. In an example the ePDCCH can be used for a dynamic assignment of DL resources e.g. PDSCH for narrow bandwidth wireless devices within an assigned NBDR a dynamic assignment of UL resources e.g. physical uplink shared channel PUSCH and a dynamic assignment of secondary NBDRs. In another example the narrow bandwidth wireless device can be tuned to the NBDR frequency via a radio frequency RF analog frequency translation and or a baseband digital frequency translation based on the secondary NBDR assignment. Then the narrow bandwidth wireless device can continue operation at the NBDR frequency e.g. receive data in the secondary NBDR . Periodically to maintain synchronization and or to receive system information transmitted in the central part the signal bandwidth spectrum e.g. master information block MIB system information block SIB and or NBDR specific information the narrow bandwidth wireless device may retune the frequency back or return back to central part the wide bandwidth spectrum to receive the primary NBDR.

The method and system described allows a narrow bandwidth wireless device to monitor a part e.g. 1.4 or 3 MHz of the wide bandwidth spectrum e.g. 10 or 20 MHz and thus the narrow bandwidth wireless device can operate at reduced peak data rate. The bandwidth reduction and corresponding signal processing for the narrow bandwidth wireless device can be performed either in a RF receiver or in a baseband processing module as illustrated in for DL only UL only or both DL and UL. The downlink signal can be received on an antenna . The RF chain can be configured to receive and transmit the analog channel signal in the assigned NBDR.

In one embodiment as illustrated in both the RF receiver a digital to analog converter DAC analog to digital converter ADC module and a baseband processing module of the narrow bandwidth wireless device may be designed to support narrow bandwidth signal processing. The digital to analog converter DAC analog to digital converter ADC module can be configured to covert between an analog channel signal and a digital modulated signal which can be decoded for reception or encoded for transmission . In an example after decoding of system information in the primary NBDR and if the node e.g. eNodeB has assigned secondary region for data transmission the baseband processing module can transmit a command to the RF synthesizer of the RF receiver to apply a carrier offset for the NBDR in order to adjust the narrow bandwidth wireless device s frequency and tune the frequency of RF receiver to a center of the assigned secondary NBDR region for further filtering and processing. The carrier offset mechanism can allow the components of the narrow bandwidth wireless device to operate at the narrow bandwidth and provide switching between the primary NBDR and the secondary NBDR. Although 1.4 MHz is showed for an NBDR frequency bandwidth and 20 MHz is showed for a wide frequency bandwidth subframe in any NBDR frequency bandwidth and any wide frequency bandwidth subframe may be used as long as the NBDR has a frequency bandwidth narrower than the wide bandwidth subframe.

The use of NBDRs can enable support of narrow bandwidth wireless device in a wireless network. The use of NBDRs has various benefits and advantages. Some of benefits can include coexistence of narrow bandwidth wireless devices e.g. MTC device with wide bandwidth wireless devices e.g. human oriented UEs in a wide bandwidth wireless network e.g. LTE network . In an example the narrow bandwidth wireless devices can be fabricated and constructed using low cost components. The use of NBDRs facilitates a low cost implementation of narrow bandwidth wireless devices e.g. MTC devices in the LTE technology. The use of NBDRs in the wide bandwidth subframe can preserve a high system capacity in terms of a number of supported devices e.g. narrow bandwidth wireless devices and wide bandwidth wireless devices . In an example the use of NBDRs provides full compatibility with the legacy wireless devices e.g. user terminals and can be nearly transparent for standard wide bandwidth wireless device through node and or network configuration and scheduling.

Another example provides a method for communicating with a narrow bandwidth wireless device in a broadband network as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium. The method includes the operation of retrieving at least one of secondary narrow bandwidth device region NBDR configuration information or primary NBDR configuration information from a primary NBDR located in a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH region of a subframe wherein the primary NBDR and the secondary NBDRs are subsets of frequency resources within a wide bandwidth subframe as in block . The operation of receiving data in at least one of the primary NBDR and the secondary NBDR based on the configuration information wherein the primary NBDR is located in the central part of a signal bandwidth spectrum including a direct current DC subcarrier and the secondary NBDR uses frequency resources within the subframe not used by the primary NBDR follows as in block .

The method can further include at least one of processing a control channel transmitted in the primary NBDR prior to receiving the data in the primary NBDR processing a control channel transmitted in the primary NBDR prior to receiving the data in the secondary NBDR in one of the consecutive subframes and processing a control channel transmitted in the secondary NBDR prior to receiving the data in the secondary NBDR. The control channel in the primary or secondary NBDR can include an enhanced physical downlink control channel ePDCCH for resource scheduling allocations which is transmitted in a frequency division multiplexing FDM mode. The method can further include receiving in the primary NBDR a frequency location of the secondary NBDR to be used for receiving the data in the secondary NBDR.

In another example the method can further include receiving control messaging from upper layer signaling indicating the secondary NBDR assignment in the subframe to be used for receiving data. The upper layer signaling can include radio resource control RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling media access control MAC signaling or combination of this signaling. The operation of receiving a physical control channel indicating the secondary NBDR assignment to be used for receiving the data can follow. In an example each NBDR comprises a number of subcarriers including sixteen or less physical resource blocks PRBs corresponding to a bandwidth of approximately 3 megahertz MHz or less e.g. 1.4 MHz 6 PRBs and 3 MHz 15 PRBs . The wide bandwidth subframe signal can include a number of subcarriers including at least 24 physical resource blocks PRBs corresponding to a bandwidth of approximately 5 MHz or more e.g. 5 MHz 25 PRBs 10 MHz 50 PRBs and 20 MHz 100 PRBs . In another example a bandwidth of the NBDR can be narrower than a bandwidth of the wide bandwidth subframe. For example if the subframe has a bandwidth of 20 MHz the NBDR bandwidth can be 10 MHz or less. In another example the subframe can include at least two NBDRs.

The secondary NBDR configuration information can include a number of NBDRs an allocation of NBDRs an assignment of NBDRs a configuration of NBDRs NBDRs frequency hopping pattern or combinations of this information. The secondary NBDR configuration information can be communicated via upper layer signaling. The upper layer signaling can include radio resource control RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling media access control MAC signaling and combinations of this signaling.

In another example the method can further include powering up the wireless device. The operation of acquiring downlink DL synchronization can follow. The next operation of the method can be acquiring a master information block MIB using physical broadcast channel PBCH processing prior to retrieving secondary NBDR configuration information. The method further includes acquiring uplink UL synchronization and establishing a radio resource control RRC connection using a random access procedure prior to receiving the data in the secondary NBDR.

Another example provides a method for communicating from a node to a narrow bandwidth wireless device in a broadband network as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium. The method includes the operation of configuring at the node a primary narrow bandwidth device region NBDR located in a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH region of a subframe wherein the primary NBDR includes secondary NBDR configuration information the primary NBDR and the secondary NBDRs are subsets of frequency resources within a wide bandwidth subframe as in block . The operation of transmitting the subframe to the narrow bandwidth device wherein the primary NBDR is transmitted in central part of a signal bandwidth spectrum including a direct current DC subcarrier and the secondary NBDR is transmitted on frequency resources within the subframe not used by the primary NBDR follows as in block .

The secondary NBDR configuration information can include a number of NBDRs an allocation of NBDRs an assignment of NBDRs a configuration of NBDRs NBDRs frequency hopping pattern or combinations of this information. The secondary NBDR configuration information can be communicated via upper layer signaling. The upper layer signaling can include radio resource control RRC signaling system information signaling broadcast control signaling media access control MAC signaling and combinations of this signaling.

In an example each NBDR comprises a number of subcarriers including six or more physical resource blocks PRBs corresponding to a bandwidth of approximately 3 megahertz MHz or less e.g. 1.4 MHz 6 PRBs and 3 MHz 15 PRBs . The wide bandwidth subframe signal can include a number of subcarriers corresponding to a bandwidth of approximately 5 MHz or more e.g. 5 MHz 25 PRBs 10 MHz 50 PRBs and 20 MHz 100 PRBs . The method can further include transmitting data in the primary or secondary NBDR.

In another example the radio frequency RF receiver configured to receive a narrow bandwidth region in the wide bandwidth subframe. The baseband processing module can be further configured to generate a carrier signal offset for the secondary NBDR relative to the DC subcarrier and adjust the RF receiver to a center frequency of the secondary NBDR.

The narrow bandwidth wireless device can include a user equipment UE or a mobile station MS . The narrow bandwidth wireless device can include an antenna a touch sensitive display screen a speaker a microphone a graphics processor an application processor internal memory a non volatile memory port or combinations these components. The narrow bandwidth wireless device can belong to a class of a machine type communication MTC device.

The node can include a node device . The node device or the node can be configured to communicate with a narrow bandwidth wireless device in a broadband network. The node device can include a processing module and a transceiver module . The processing module can be operable to configure narrow bandwidth device regions NBDRs located in a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH region of a subframe. The NBDRs can be subsets of frequency resources within a wide bandwidth subframe. In an example the NBDRs can include a primary NBDR and at least one secondary NBDR. In another example the NBDR can include just the primary NBDR. In an example the primary NBDR can include secondary NBDR configuration information and the secondary NBDR can include data. The transceiver module can be configured to transmit the primary NBDR on subcarriers located in the central part of a signal bandwidth spectrum including a direct current DC subcarrier and transmit the secondary NBDR on subcarriers within the subframe not used by the primary NBDR. The subframe can include the primary NBDR and a plurality of secondary NBDRs. The node can be configured to transmit data to a plurality of narrow bandwidth wireless devices using the primary NBDR and secondary NBDRs. Each narrow bandwidth wireless device can be assigned a distinct primary or secondary NBDR for data communication. The node can be configured to communicate with a wireless wide bandwidth device using a bandwidth of at least 10 megahertz MHz and the narrow bandwidth wireless device using a bandwidth of approximately 1.4 MHz.
