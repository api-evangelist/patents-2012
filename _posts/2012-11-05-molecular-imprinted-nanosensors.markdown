This application is a divisional of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 510 414 filed on Jul. 28 2009 and entitled MOLECULAR IMPRINTED NANOSENSORS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SAME the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety and for all purposes.

This invention was in part made with U.S. government support under contract No. W31P4Q 08 C 0401 awarded by DARPA. Accordingly the government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates in general to a molecular recognition sensor system and process of making same which can be used for the detection of different chemicals in both the liquid and gaseous states and more particularly to a sensor device based on a molecular imprinted conducting polymer in nanoscale and process of making same.

Numerous methods and devices exist for the chemical detection of analytes. For example prior art methods have attempted to detect analytes by imprinting analyte molecules into a polymer. These methods employ arranging polymerizable monomers around a template followed by polymerization and template removal. The result is a polymer having cavities of the same size and shape as the analyte. The transduction methods detecting the binding of the analytes into the cavities created in the polymer can be electrical electrochemical or optical etc which measure the resistance conductance electrochemical properties and optical absorption of the imprinted polymer. See e.g. Jenkens et al. Anal. Chem. Vol 71 p. 373 378 1999 Ellen L. Holthoff Frank V. Bright Analytica Chimica Acta Vol 594 p. 147 161 2007 and Arnold et al. Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest Vol. 20 No. 2 1999 incorporated herein by reference.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 807 842 discloses a molecular recognition sensor system for detecting the presence and concentration of an analyte including a resistive sensor having a semi conductive polymer film which swells when exposed to an analyte and interferents together with a molecular imprinted resistive sensor having a semi conductive polymer film imprinted with the analyte. The resistivity of the film is monitored during sensing to detect any changes in the resistivity of the film produced by the presence of an analyte.

In this system the polymer film imprinted with an analyte swells when exposed to interferents. A circuit connected to the resistive sensor and the molecular imprinted resistive sensor detects a change in the resistance of the molecular imprinted resistive sensor when exposed to the analyte and interferents and subtracts the change in the resistance of the molecular imprinted resistive sensor from the change in resistance of the resistive sensor to reduce the effect of any interferents on the change and resistance of the resistive sensor thereby determining the presence and concentration of the analyte.

The resistivity of the semi conductive polymer film is monitored during sensing. However molecular imprinted polymer films often suffer long response time due to the limitation of diffusion. Also the sensitivity of the film sensor is limited because the lateral current shunting reduces the resistance change.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 384 589 discloses a nanoscale molecular imprinted polymer. However the process of calming the polymer is complex using a laser source for photoinitiation to produce nanoscale polymer features. The conventional imprinting process is time consuming and complicated by the use of cross linkers. Further the fabrication process restricts the detection methods to fluorescence and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy which increase the cost of the operation due to the integration of the optical components.

U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 20060207878 discloses conducting polymer nanowire sensors. One dimensional conducting polymer nanowires are defined with electron beam lithography and fabricated using electrochemical polymerization. The analyte binding species and analyte are restricted to antibody antigen protein polynucleotide and DNA. These sensors can be sensitive and selective. However both the fabrication and the biological species for binding are expensive. Furthermore biological binding restricts the future application.

Nevertheless these molecular imprinted polymer devices suffer from the distinct disadvantage that they are designed to be specific to only one target analyte are large bulky complex delicate and difficult to use.

It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a molecular recognition sensor system and method of using same.

It is another object of this invention to such a molecular recognition sensor system and method which can accurately detect an analyte.

It is a further object of this invention to provide such a molecular recognition sensor system and method which can accurately detect the concentration of an analyte.

It is another object of this invention to provide such a molecular recognition sensor system and method which can detect a plurality of analytes.

It is a further object of this invention to provide such a molecular recognition sensor system and method which can detect a plurality of analyte concentrations.

It is another object of this invention to provide such a molecular recognition sensor system and method which can detect a plurality of analyte in liquid and gaseous phases.

It is yet another object of this invention to provide such a molecular recognition sensor system which is compact inexpensive and easy to use.

It is a further object of this invention to provide such a molecular recognition sensor system which is simple in design and easily transportable.

A molecular recognition sensor system fabricated according to the present invention is shown generally at in and comprises voltage controller and associated circuitry shown generally at and a molecular imprinted nanosensor device shown generally at . In a preferred embodiment the molecular imprinted nanosensor is based on a silicon substrate . In another preferred embodiment the molecular imprinted nanosensor device is based on a substrate material selected from the group consisting of silicon glass quartz sapphire plastic ceramic metal other semiconductive materials or a flexible material. A first electrical insulation layer is formed on one surface of substrate . The first electrical insulation layer can be formed of a material preferably selected from the group consisting of silicon oxide silicon nitride hafnium silicate zirconium silicate hafnium dioxide zirconium dioxide aluminum oxide etc.

Pairs of electrodes are then defined on the first electrical insulation layer using photolithography and fabricated using conventional Si processing methods. Electrodes are preferably formed of platinum palladium copper or other metal more preferably from gold. Electrode pairs are initially separated by a micro size gap not shown during their formation using photolithography.

Most upper surfaces of electrodes are then covered with a second insulation layer . The insulation layer is preferably formed of silicon dioxide or other insulation materials more preferably by silicon nitride.

The initial micro size gap between electrodes is then reduced or decreased in size by electrochemical deposition of additional electrode materials onto the surface of the electrodes in the micro size gap. In a preferred embodiment electrode pairs are formed of gold and preferably platinum palladium copper or other metal more preferably gold is then used in the electrochemical deposition process to further decrease the microgap.

In a preferred embodiment the electrochemical deposition of electrode material is carried out until the micro size gap is reduced to a nano size gap of from about 2 to 100 nm more preferably about 30 nm. The size of the nanojunction can be controlled by adjusting the voltage current and deposition time in the electrochemical deposition process.

Sensors in nanoscale such as in the present invention have several advantages such as good conductivity fast response and high sensitivity. This electrochemical deposition process can be carried out simultaneously on different electrode pairs formed on a substrate . The fabrication of nano sized gaps produced in this manner is more efficient and less expensive than conventional electron beam lithography.

A polymer nanojunction shown generally at is then fabricated to bridge the resultant nanogap between electrodes . This is accomplished by electrochemically polymerizing conductive monomers containing a target analyte in the gap between electrodes to form a conducting polymer in this nanojunction. The conducting polymer is preferably selected from the group consisting of polypyrrole polythiophene polyphenylene polyacetylene and derivatives thereof. More preferably conducting polymer is formed from a polyaniline copolymer containing target analyte molecules.

In a preferred embodiment the monomer used to form the electrically conductive polymer nanojunction also contains a self doped aniline to retain the conductivity of the conducting polymer over a wide pH range. In a preferred embodiment the self doped aniline is 3 aminobenzoic acid or other derivatives thereof which contain either a carboxylic group or sulfonic group. Preferably sulfuric acid is used in the polymerization to dope aniline but other acids can also be used such as hydrochloric acid chloric acid perchloric acid nitric acid and the like

In the polymerization and molecular imprinting steps the molar ratio between regular aniline and self doped aniline is preferably from about 3 1 1 1 depending upon the pH value of the detection environment. More preferably the molar ratio between regular aniline and self doped aniline is about 1 1. The polymerization of electrochemical imprinted polymer is preferably carried out in water but it can also be carried out in a mixture of water with ethanol water with acetone or water with other solvents.

The concentration of the target analyte in the polymerization is preferably from about 30 to 1000 ppm more preferably from about 500 to 800 ppm. The concentration of sulfuric acid in the polymerization is preferably from about 0.05 to 2M more preferably about 0.5M. Since molecular printing creates cavities exactly the same as the analyte molecules in size and shape the resultant sensors are highly selective.

The resultant size of conducting polymer nanojunction is preferably from about 2 to 100 nm more preferably about 30 nm. The size of the nanojunction is determined by the size of the nanogap which can be controlled by the deposition time and current used in depositing additional electrode material onto electrode pairs .

The resultant conducting polymer is used in the present invention as the backbone of the nanosensor device . The conducting polymer such as polyaniline is electronic conductive and is easy to process by electrochemical polymerization. Compared to conventional molecular imprinted polymer processes target analytes can be incorporated into the conducting polymer in a single step process during polymerization.

After formation of polymer nanojunction target analyte molecules are extracted from the conducting polymer leaving binding sites complimentary in size and shape see .

In conventional molecular imprinting washing or soaking the sensor in solvent is used to wash away the imprinted target analyte molecules. However in the present invention after the sensor is immersed in a analyte molecule free solvent liquid the electrode potential is cycled. During the cycling conducting polymer swells and shrinks back to the original state. The swelling during cycling effects more efficient extraction of target analyte molecules from the conducting polymer backbone which offers high sensitivity of the sensor device . The extraction step ends when the current of the sensor stabilizes.

In a preferred embodiment molecular imprinted nanosensors as described above can be fabricated in array for real time simultaneous detection of different analytes. In such cases different target analytes are used in the conducting polymers between electrode pairs .

In a preferred embodiment the open area of the nanojunction exposed to liquid or gas is from about 4 to 400 mand the ionic leakage current ranges from about 1 pA to 1 nA. The smaller the ionic leakage current the more sensitive is the sensor. Since the ionic current is very small the current of the nanosensor is tens of nanoamperes to tens of microamperes. The preferred current range is hundreds of nanoamperes. In a preferred embodiment the open area of the second layer insulation area is 100 m.

A flow chart shown in illustrates the above described sequence of steps which are employed in forming the molecular imprinted nanosensors of the present invention. Flow chart illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention in which silicon is used as substrate .

Gold is used in forming electrodes . The molecular imprinted conducting polymer is preferably formed from polyaniline and self doped aniline 3 aminobenzoic and analyte extraction is preferably employed using electrode potential cycling to facilitate removal of target analyte molecules and formation of recognition binding sites .

After formation of the binding sites the interaction of target analytes and the molecular imprinted nanosensor is transduced converted into an electrical signal. The molecular imprinted nanosensor shown generally at is robust and can be reused. For the detection of a target analyte in the liquid phase the conductance of conducting polymer nanojunction is controlled at the most sensitive state with a voltage controller which offers high sensitivity. For the detection of a target analyte in the gaseous phase voltage control is not needed. The detection both in liquid and gas phases occurs in real time. Molecular imprinted nanosensors can be used for continuously monitoring target analytes.

By imprinting different target analytes into different conducting polymer nanojunctions molecular imprinted nanosensor devices are capable of simultaneous detection of multiple target analytes at the same time.

Molecular imprinted nanosensor is capable of detection of a wide range of target analytes. They can be organophosphate chemical nerve agents such as sarin and somin volatile organic compounds such as xylene toluene pesticides such as DDT Dichloro diphenyl Trichloroethane dinitro o cresol persistent organic pollutants such as hexachlorobenzene herbicides such as atrazine drugs such as prulifloxacin morphine and explosives such as TNT trinitrotoluene and HMX cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine .

The cost of fabrication of nanoscaled gaps and nanosensors according to the present invention is relatively small. Electrochemical deposition is used to shrink the microscaled gap to nanoscale and electrochemical polymerization is used to fabricate the nanosensor . Both of these processes are capable of being used in mass production of the nanosensors of the present invention. Nanosensors produced according to the present invention exhibit a response of molecular imprinted nanosensor device to analytes on a linear basis from 0 to 1 ppm 1000 ppb which facilitates ease of calibration.

The following examples set forth a preferred process of producing a molecular imprinted nanosensor of the present invention. However this example is not intended to limit in any way the scope and breadth of the present invention.

Volatile organic compound o xylene was imprinted and detected with molecular imprinted nanosensor. A gold nanogap was first achieved by electrochemically depositing gold materials onto the gold pair of electrodes separated by a 1 m gap. This nanogap was then bridged with polyaniline copolymer by cycling electrode potential in a solution containing 24 mM regular aniline 24 mM self doped aniline 3 aminobenzoic acid 0.5M sulfuric acid as supporting electrolyte and 800 ppm o xylene as the target analyte molecule. After formation of the molecular imprinted nanosensor the analyte molecules were then extracted by cycling the electrode in an analyte free sulfuric acid 0.1M and detection solution. During the cycling the solution was replaced for 3 6 times until the current of the nanosensor was stabilized.

O xylene was then detected in pH 6.5 solution. Upon exposure to 32 ppb on xylene a distinct decrease occurred in the peak current of the sensor. With the concentration range from 0 to 250 ppb the response of the electric molecular imprinted nanosensor to o xylene was found to be linear as shown in the graph in .

Detection of a chemical nerve agent simulant DMMP Dimethyl methylphosphonate was demonstrated with DMMP imprinted nanosensor solid squares in . The experimental conditions are the same as in EXAMPLE 1 except the template molecules are DMMP in this case. In order to prove that molecular imprinted nanosensor does provide specific binding sites of the analytes the response of non imprinted nanosensor to DMMP is also shown in solid triangulars . Compared to DMMP imprinted nanosensor non imprinted nanosensor has almost no response to DMMP. Further DMMP imprinted nanosensor is sensitive to DMMP but has no response to PMP Pinacolyl methyl phosphonate even the two molecules are very similar on molecular structures which indicates the great selectivity of our molecular imprinted nanosensor. This work demonstrated that molecular imprinted nanosensor is capable for the detection of toxic organic phosphate chemical nerve agents.
