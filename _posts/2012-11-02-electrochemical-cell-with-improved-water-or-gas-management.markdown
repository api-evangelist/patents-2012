This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 583 782 filed on Jan. 6 2012 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. NNC08CA87C awarded by the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland Ohio. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention generally relates to an electrochemical cell with improved water or gas management and in one exemplary embodiment relates to a fuel cell that utilizes high bubble point polymeric porous media.

Electrochemical cell devices are typically made up of a plurality of electrochemical cells arranged in groups or stacks and commonly serve to electrolytically disassociate water or another liquid with or without dissolved constituents into its components i.e. electrolysis cells or catalytically combine hydrogen or other fuel and an oxidizer i.e. fuel cells with electricity being either supplied or generated respectively. Other related functions for electrochemical cell devices include their use as compressors separation and or purification means sensors and combinations of these functions.

Within arranged groups or stacks each electrochemical cell includes a cathode an electrolyte e.g. a membrane and an anode. In Proton Exchange Membrane or PEM cells where the electrolyte is a cation exchange membrane the cathode membrane anode assembly i.e. membrane electrode assembly or MEA is typically supported on both sides by flow fields made up of screen packs or channeled plates. Flow fields usually in the form of expanded metal or woven screens or adhesive bonded laminated or machined assemblies facilitate fluid movement removal of product water or product gas and also serve to provide in for example PEM cells mechanical support for the MEA.

Electrochemical cells when operated as fuel cells or water electrolyzers are desirable for various applications. Fuel cells for example have been proposed for many applications including as an energy source for supplying an aircraft with electric energy.

In specific regard to fuel cells with in cell static water removal capabilities such cells utilize conductive metal or metallic porous media that functions to remove fuel cell product water via a pressure differential. Unfortunately this approach which attempts to balance bubble point with acceptable water transport rates is usually limited to low approximately 0.01 0.06 Megapascals MPa bubble pressure.

Bubble point is used as a measure of the resistance of the flow of gas phase fluids through pores of filter or filter like materials. The bubble point value is determined by observing when bubbles first begin to emerge on the permeate side or downstream side of a fully wetted membrane filter or filter like material when pressurized with a gas on the feed upstream side of the material.

High bubble point materials with excellent water transport exist and are commercially available but when compared to metal or metallic porous media are typically less electrically conductive or non conductive.

In view of the above what is needed is a fuel cell that utilizes high bubble point polymeric porous media with excellent water transport capability that has the ability to conduct electrical current.

Generally speaking the present invention fulfills this need by providing an electrochemical cell that comprises a water gas porous separator prepared from a polymeric material and one or more conductive cell components that pass through or are located in close proximity to the water gas porous separator the electrochemical cell providing a high level of in cell electrical conductivity.

In an exemplary embodiment the inventive electrochemical cell operates as an in cell static water removal fuel cell wherein the water gas porous separator is prepared from a high bubble point polymeric material.

The water gas porous separator employed in this exemplary embodiment has a bubble point of greater than 0.06 MPa preferably from about 0.07 to about 0.55 MPa which provides excellent water removal.

The inventive fuel cell demonstrates an area specific resistance ASTM B193 02 2008 Standard Test Method for Resistivity of Electrical Conductor Materials of less than or equal to about 100 mohms cm preferably less than about 20 mohm cm.

Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. Unless otherwise defined all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All publications patent applications patents and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict the present specification including definitions will control. In addition the materials methods and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.

As noted above the electrochemical cell of the present invention comprises a water gas porous separator. In the case of a fuel cell the water gas porous separator is prepared from a high bubble point polymeric material and the inventive fuel cell further comprises one or more conductive cell components that pass through or are located in close proximity to the water gas porous separator. The inventive fuel cell provides a high level of in cell electrical conductivity.

The inventive fuel cell may be manufactured using carbon composite or metal based materials with assembled stacks using either bipolar current or edge current collection design.

The water gas porous separator used with the inventive fuel cell offers excellent water transport while preventing gas cross over from the oxygen chamber to the water chamber. In an exemplary embodiment the porous separator allows water to pass at low pressures ranging from at least about 0.001 MPa while providing a gas bubble point of greater than 0.06 MPa preferably from about 0.07 to about 0.55 MPa.

Contemplated water gas porous separators include separators in the form of plate like structures that have a diameter ranging from about 2.54 to about 76.2 centimeters cm preferably from about 7.62 to about 38.1 cm and a thickness ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.25 millimeters mm preferably from about 0.10 to about 0.20 mm .

The pore size or diameter of the pores of the water gas porous separator ranges from about 0.03 to about 0.2 microns. The interior surface of the pores is wettable to water which may be an inherent property of the material used to prepare the separator. Additionally as noted above the open pores of the separator are capable of providing a bubble pressure sufficient to prevent gas cross over from the oxygen chamber to the water chamber.

In an exemplary embodiment the water gas porous separator is prepared from a polyethersulfone PES membrane filter medium 0.1 micron pore size rated flow 2.8 to 7.4 milliliters ml min cmat 0.7 Bar that is sold under the brand name SUPOR by the PALL Specialty Materials company of Port Washington New York N.Y. 11050 U.S.A. PES is an inherently hydrophilic membrane that wets out quickly and completely resulting in superior flow rates and high throughputs.

In another exemplary embodiment the water gas porous separator is another PES membrane 0.03 micron pore size rated flow 5.5 ml min cmat 0.07 MPa that is sold under the brand name STERILITECH by GE Osmonics 5951 Clearwater Drive Minnetonka Minn. 55343.

In a first preferred embodiment the porous separator contains a number of through holes. The through holes allow for physical contact between conductive mating structures i.e. conductive tongue and groove structures located on opposing sides of the porous separator.

Referring now to in detail reference numeral has been used to generally designate one embodiment of the fuel cell or fuel cell stack of the present invention while reference numeral has been used to generally designate one embodiment of the water gas porous separator. The porous separator is shown with a series of parallel elongate oval shaped through holes . A water chamber or flowfield with a mating structure is located on one side of separator while an oxygen screen frame assembly with a complimentary mating structure is located on an opposing side thereby forming a so called water transport assembly. Generally speaking the water chamber or flowfield and the oxygen screen frame assembly both include a central portion having a multitude of fluid flow spaces and a frame portion integral with and circumferentially surrounding the central portion . The diameter of porous separator is slightly larger than the diameter of the central portions of the water chamber or flowfield and the oxygen screen frame assembly . An MEA is shown on an opposing side of the oxygen screen frame assembly while a solid separator sheet is shown on an opposing side of the water chamber or flowfield .

The oxygen screen frame assembly shown in which is preferably a diffusion bonded laminar assembly has a series of bonded e.g. diffusion bonded conductive tongue extensions along an upper surface that mate with a series of conductive strips bonded e.g. diffusion bonded onto a lower surface of the central portion of the water chamber or flowfield . As best shown in upon assembly of the inventive fuel cell or fuel cell stack these mating structures will physically contact each other through the through holes provided in the porous separator thereby forming an electrical pathway between the conductive oxygen screen frame assembly and the conductive water chamber or flowfield . In this embodiment current flows through the active area of the cell.

An insulating sealing gasket e.g. a TEFLON gasket not shown is positioned between the frame portion of the oxygen screen frame assembly and the frame portion of the water chamber or flowfield to insure a uniform fit and seal between these components.

A top planar view of the oxygen screen frame assembly is shown in . Here the insulating sealing gasket is shown extending around the perimeter of assembly .

A two cell 50 cm bipolar current collection hybrid test stack was prepared in accordance with the teachings of the present invention and tested. One cell in the test stack utilized gold conductive tongue extensions while the other cell utilized carbon conductive tongue extensions . The MEA for each cell employed a NAFION 117 PFSA membrane. A humidifier degasser cell H D cell was installed but the degasser was disabled to allow bubble detection. Stack test conditions were as follows temperature 70 C. Opressure 0.21 MPa Hpressure 0.21 MPa HO pressure 0 MPa approximately 0.21 MPa Oto HO differential . The bipolar current collection hybrid test stack successfully performed as follows 

Instead of current flowing through the active area of the cell current may also flow around the perimeter of the cell. Referring now to reference numeral has been used to generally designate a second preferred embodiment of the inventive fuel cell or fuel cell stack. Here the conductive tongue and groove structure used with the water chamber or flowfield and the oxygen screen frame assembly and the through holes used with the porous separator have been eliminated and current is now passed by way of a conductive sealing gasket located on the perimeter of the cell. This conductive sealing gasket which replaces the non conductive insulating gasket used in the first preferred embodiment electrically connects the water chamber or flowfield and the oxygen screen frame assembly . As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art this embodiment simplifies manufacture by combining the sealing and conductivity functions into one component. As in the first preferred embodiment the diameter of porous separator in this embodiment is slightly larger than the diameter of the central portions of the water chamber or flowfield and the oxygen screen frame assembly .

As best shown in which is a top planar view of the oxygen screen frame assembly conductive sealing gasket extends around the perimeter of assembly and optionally also around fluid ports .

Two two cell 50 cm edge current conduction test stacks were also prepared in accordance with the teachings of the present invention and tested. In the first test stack both cells utilized a full PES disk and 0.13 mm GRAFOIL GTA conductive sealing gasket located on the perimeter of the cell while in the second test stack both cells utilized two full PES disks and a 0.25 mm GRAFOIL GTA conductive sealing gasket . The MEA for each cell employed a NAFION 117 membrane. An H D cell was installed but the degasser was disabled to allow bubble detection. Stack test conditions were as follows temperature 70 Opressure 0.21 MPa Hpressure 0.21 MPa HO pressure 0 MPa approximately 0.21 and 0.31 MPa Oto HO differential . The edge current conduction test stacks successfully performed as follows 

While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. Thus the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the exemplary embodiments. For example the same approach as described above may be taken for electrochemical cells in the electrolysis mode with hydrophobic membranes being used instead of hydrophilic membranes. That is by using a hydrophobic membrane that allows gas to flow but stops water one can introduce water to the cell generate gas and then have the gas leave the cell across the membrane.
