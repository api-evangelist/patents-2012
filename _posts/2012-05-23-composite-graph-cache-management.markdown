Data owners are often concerned about shielding their data sources from unwanted or unexpected data requests. In particular a data source that services a mobile application should not be exposed to an unpredictable amount of data requests from the mobile application.

Conventionally mobile applications directly access data sources e.g. enterprise data sources to retrieve data. Because a plurality of mobile applications can make concurrent requests for data at different times it often leads to an unexpected load on the data sources. Furthermore because enterprise data typically exists in disparate formats at geographically distributed locations servicing data requests received from the mobile applications can be a resource intensive process.

Accordingly systems methods and computer program products are needed that efficiently respond to mobile application data requests while shielding data sources from being negatively impacted by such requests.

Embodiments relate to data synchronization between a mobile application and an enterprise data source. In one embodiment a computer implemented method for synchronizing data between a mobile application and an enterprise data source includes receiving a request for data from an application executing on a mobile device receiving a document including the requested data from a data source where the document represents a graph of data having a plurality of nodes and providing a partial graph of data to the application where the partial graph is derived from the received document and at least includes the requested data.

In another embodiment a server based system for synchronizing data between a mobile application and an enterprise data source includes a caching module configured to receive a request for data from an application executing on a mobile device receive a document including the requested data from a data source where the document represents a graph of data having a plurality of nodes and provide a partial graph of data to the application where the partial graph is derived from the received document and at least includes the requested data.

In an additional embodiment a computer readable storage device has control logic recorded thereon that when executed by a processor causes the processor to synchronize data between a mobile application and an enterprise data source. The control logic includes computer readable program code to cause the processor to receive a request for data from an application executing on a mobile device receive a document including the requested data from a data source where the document represents a graph of data having a plurality of nodes and provide a partial graph of data to the application where the partial graph is derived from the received document and at least includes the requested data.

While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those skilled in the art with access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications applications and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which embodiments of the invention would be of significant utility.

It is noted that references in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment an example embodiment etc. indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature structure or characteristic but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature structure or characteristic. Moreover such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further when a particular feature structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment it would be within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to incorporate such a feature structure or characteristic with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.

Various embodiments include methods systems and computer program products for synchronizing data between a mobile application and an enterprise data source. Embodiments may be independently implemented or incorporated as features in other systems such as systems that provide data caching for mobile applications. An example system is described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 760 233 filed on Apr. 14 2010 entitled Data Caching for Mobile Applications which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Mobile clients request and use information from a variety of enterprise data sources. Mobile applications enable mobile clients to create modify and otherwise access enterprise data which may be stored and accessed as documents objects or other forms of structured data. Further data created or updated by a mobile client whether connected or offline needs to be synchronized with the system of record. The embodiments described herein enable mobile clients to efficiently retrieve and update enterprise data using partial datasets.

For example in an embodiment a mobile client requests data from an enterprise data source using a mobile application. The request is received by middleware configured to communicate partial documents and change sets with mobile clients while providing full document support for enterprise data sources. The middleware is also configured to cache full documents and other data structures locally. The centrally cached documents may be used to service requests for data from other mobile clients and to help reduce the overall number of requests made to enterprise data sources.

Next in an embodiment the middleware searches its local cache for a copy of the document containing the requested data. The middleware then queries the enterprise data source when the data is not available locally. The middleware requests the full document e.g. XML JSON iDoc etc. containing the enterprise data requested by the mobile client. However even though the backend system of record e.g. SAP DBMS etc. manages the information as a business document business object or other unit of work the mobile client only needs a subset or partial set of this data.

In an embodiment the middleware prepares and returns a partial set of data to the mobile client in response to the initial request. The mobile client then may create new data or modify existing data associated with this partial dataset using a mobile application. Further one or more modified versions of the data may be created while the mobile client is either online or offline.

Next in an embodiment the middleware receives a modified version of the partial set of data from the mobile device. The middleware then determines the operations that were performed to produce the modified version by comparing the modified version to corresponding data in the original document. The middleware creates a new version of the document to reflect the changes that were made to the partial dataset and provides the new version to the enterprise data source.

In an embodiment the middleware serves as an intermediary between the mobile client and the enterprise server. The middleware is configured to communicate with enterprise data sources using full business documents business objects and other units of work. The middleware is also configured to exchange partial datasets or subsets of full documents with various types of clients. Thus the middleware provides efficient interaction between mobile clients and enterprise data sources while ensuring that full sets of enterprise data are consistent and valid.

For example according to an embodiment mobile device may be any computing device designed for personal use by a user or integrated with other computer systems or computing devices for use by an end user. For example mobile device may include any computing device such as a desktop computer laptop tablet smartphone gaming system navigation device portable media player mobile device electronic device and computing devices embedded into other systems including for example automobiles and appliances. Mobile device may also include any other type of computer system having at least one processor and memory.

Network can be any network or combination of networks that can carry data communications. Such a network can include but is not limited to a wired e.g. Ethernet or a wireless e.g. Wi Fi and 4G network. In addition the network may include but is not limited to a local area network and or wide area network such as the Internet. The network can support protocols and technology including but not limited to Internet or World Wide Web protocols and or services. Intermediate network routers gateways or servers may be provided between servers and clients depending on a particular application or environment.

Server and any combination of its components may be part of or may be implemented using one or more computing devices. Such server based computing devices may include but are not limited to one or more standalone servers distributed computing systems clustered computer systems cloud computing systems and grid computing systems.

Mobile application accesses data from enterprise data source by making calls to an API or other interface provided by middleware in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention middleware is the iAnywhere Mobilink iMO and SUP middleware provided by Sybase Inc. of Dublin Calif.

One skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that enterprise data source may be any number of types of data sources including for example a relational database or a remote procedure. Middleware facilitates communications through the use of its API by an application to one or more data sources such as enterprise data source .

Document is a representation of data in any form and type contained in enterprise data source in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For example many data sources enterprise applications and systems of record have the ability to manage data as a graph an XML document a JSON document an iDoc or another specific representation of data. For example a system of record may contain an order having specific line items which reference product information. Such information can be represented as a graph of data with a plurality of nodes and may be contained within a single business document.

According to an embodiment document may represent multiple data sources e.g. document may comprise subsets of data from multiple data sources . According to another embodiment document may include metadata which may be interpreted by the software of mobile application to facilitate access of the data from enterprise data source through middleware .

In an embodiment not intended to limit the invention enterprise data source provides access to enterprise resources. As an example enterprise resources ERs include but are not limited to database management systems DBMS SAP enterprise systems web services data files hypertext transfer protocol HTTP systems and even spreadsheets. In addition and according to another embodiment third parties e.g. customers software vendors etc. may extend functionality of enterprise data source to include for example integration with additional data sources not shown .

According to an embodiment mobile device is an occasionally connected computing device that executes at least one mobile application . Additionally mobile device includes mobile cache . In an embodiment mobile cache may be used to receive and store numerous sets of data some or all of them being partial sets of data which mobile device receives from middleware . Further mobile cache may store modified versions of datasets partial or full created by an offline mobile device that middleware will later use to update enterprise data source .

According to another embodiment the modified versions of datasets may be stored in mobile cache while mobile device is not connected to a network. Mobile application may be configured to synchronize one or more versions of the datasets with middleware when mobile device reconnects to a network. In an alternative embodiment one or more modified version of enterprise data may be pushed to middleware or pulled by middleware on a scheduled or unscheduled basis.

Middleware includes caching module and cache . In an embodiment middleware acts as an interface between mobile application and enterprise data source . For example middleware may be configured to allow clients to access enterprise data in partial datasets without having to transport an entire document or dataset between mobile device and enterprise data server . Thus middleware may manage the state of the document or full dataset on behalf of mobile device which may only be concerned with partial sets of data.

In another embodiment middleware reduces unwanted or unexpected loads e.g. unpredictable data requests on enterprise data source using caching module and cache . In particular according to an embodiment middleware services mobile application data requests using caching module and cache . Thus at times mobile application need not invoke direct requests on enterprise data source or any other backend enterprise information systems. In this way embodiments of the present invention efficiently service mobile application data requests while shielding data sources from being negatively impacted or overloaded by the requests.

Enterprise data source includes document . Enterprise data source may represent one or more data sources that exist within an enterprise environment. For example enterprise data source may include but is not limited to database management systems DBMS data warehouses SAP enterprise systems custom software applications web services data files hypertext transfer protocol HTTP systems and also spreadsheets. In an embodiment enterprise data source manages data using one or more of a graph an XML document a JSON document an iDoc or other types of data collections. Document represents a collection of data.

In another embodiment mobile application requests data from enterprise data source . Caching module receives the request and makes a corresponding request to enterprise data source on behalf of mobile device . Enterprise data source provides document to caching module which then places document in cache . Caching module identifies the partial set of data requested by mobile application existing in document . Caching module then responds to mobile application by providing the partial dataset.

In a further embodiment mobile application is used to create a new version of the partial dataset while mobile device is offline. The new version of the partial dataset is stored in mobile cache until mobile device is able to reconnect to middleware . Once caching module receives the new version of the partial dataset it determines the operations that were performed to produce the modified version it creates a new version of document based on the determined operations and it then provides the new version of document to enterprise data source .

Method begins at step when a request for data is received from an application executing on an occasionally connected mobile device. According to an embodiment mobile application requests data from an enterprise data source which has the ability to manage data as a document capable of being represented as a graph having a plurality of nodes.

In an embodiment mobile application is configured to send requests for enterprise data to middleware . For example mobile application may be configure to send data requests to caching module using an Application Programming Interface API which may include a REST based or other type of web service.

In an embodiment caching module receives a request from mobile application for data residing on enterprise data source . Caching module may first search cache to determine whether the requested data is available locally. For example caching module may have stored data previously requested by one or more mobile clients in cache . Caching module may then service the request using a cached version of the data available in cache instead of requesting the data from enterprise data source .

In some embodiments clients and systems may access enterprise data source either directly or using one or more systems other than middleware . In these scenarios a version of a document stored in cache could become stale. Thus caching module may also be configured to synchronize a version of a document in local cache with a newer version from enterprise data source to avoid providing mobile device with outdated data. For example caching module may perform a check periodically or based on a request to determine whether a newer version of a cached document is available from enterprise data source .

In these scenarios partial or full datasets stored in mobile cache or on mobile device may also become outdated. Such scenarios are further discussed along with systems and methods for providing cache conflict detection and resolution in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 478 181 filed May 23 2012 entitled CACHE CONFLICT DETECTION incorporated herein by reference in its entirety although the invention is not limited to these teachings.

In another embodiment caching module determines that the data requested by mobile application is not available in cache . Caching module then requests and receives the data from enterprise data source . For example the requested data may include document .

According to an embodiment caching module may persist for some time period data result sets objects and documents such as document in cache . Thus a subsequent requestor either the same or another mobile device can benefit from data previously stored within cache helping to reduce the overall number of requests made to enterprise data source .

At step a partial graph of data including at least the requested data is provided to mobile application . In an embodiment caching module provides mobile application with a partial set of data from a larger dataset e.g. document which originated from enterprise data source .

For example a mobile application may request data associated with a single service ticket. However enterprise data source may store or provide the requested service ticket data with other information such as related service tickets by date or by user. Caching module is configured to provide a partial dataset that includes the requested data to mobile application .

According to another embodiment mobile application receives the partial dataset and may store its own local copy in mobile cache . Mobile application then modifies the partial dataset while mobile device is either online or offline. For example when mobile device is offline one or more modified versions of the partial dataset may be stored in mobile cache until mobile device is able to reconnect to middleware .

At step a modified version of the partial graph is received from the mobile application. In an embodiment caching module receives one or more modified versions of the partial graph stored in mobile cache .

According to an embodiment mobile application may be used to create update and delete data associated with a partial dataset thus creating a modified version of the partial dataset. One or more modified versions of the partial dataset then may be stored in mobile cache and then later communicated to middleware for graph merge processing with an associated document or dataset.

At step the operations that were performed to produce the modified version of the partial graph are determined. According to an embodiment caching module determines one or more operations that were performed on the partial dataset by mobile application . For example caching module can derive the delta or the operations performed against the partial dataset on mobile device by comparing the modified version of the dataset with an earlier version of the partial dataset or the full version of the document from which the partial dataset originated.

At step a locally cached version of the graph is modified based on the determined operations that were performed on the partial graph producing a new version of the graph. In an embodiment caching module modifies a cached version of document available in cache based on the one or more operations that were determined to be performed to create the modified partial dataset. For example caching module performs graph merge processing to incorporate the changes introduced by the partial dataset into the original document. Thus caching module synchronizes document with the changes that were made to the corresponding partial dataset producing a new version of document .

At step the new version of the graph is provided to the enterprise data source. According to an embodiment caching module provides the new version of document to enterprise data source . Thus caching module completes the changes made to the partial dataset by providing a full new version of document to enterprise data source .
