The present invention relates to illumination systems and methods especially to system and methods for creation of an artificial atmosphere in a private room as well as in public places such as train and bus stations airports airplanes buses trains ships theaters and other entertainment facilities and the like.

Since the invention of a lighting bulb by Edison lighting systems have become irrevocable part of people s daily lives. In the modern society lighting systems are constantly being developed.

The prior art presents numerous improvements of lighting systems. For example US Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0041161 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety discloses entertainment game based methods and apparatus involving video display and lighting facilities in which a computer video display is necessary part of the apparatus structure. A screen for use with the lighting system is provided in a manner so as to be able to reflect illumination produced by the lighting system.

Another US Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0023996 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety describes a control system comprising a processor for receiving control signals from at least one input device computer related program code enabling the processor to generate output signals based on the control signals an interface associated with the processor which interface configuring at least one of regulators regulating a number of light devices. It mentions that the system may be used for scene control e.g. changing the lighting in a great room from a party atmosphere to a showing of the art on the walls that is dimming the lighting to facilitate the viewing of the art projected on the walls.

Another solution presented by International Publication No. WO 01 05195 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety is dedicated to a system and methods for creation and design of lighting sequences comprising a processor a software interface to create a program that may include a number of lighting sequences capable of being executed by a lighting controller which controls a number of lighting units. The sequence is assembled from objects stored in memory representing lighting effects or also may include input from analog digital manual or another external source such as a user sensor sound level detection device RF or IR signal feedback from the lighting system.

The prior art also presents a real world representation system disclosed in International Publication No. WO 02 092183 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety that comprises a set of markup language enabled devices each providing one or more parameters e.g. audio and visual characteristics. The markup language enabled devices may include different display lighting audio and heating devices walls and floor provided with display functionality animatronic electronic and robotic equipment and interactive pictures. At least one of the devices can receive a real world description in the form of an instruction set of a markup language and the devices are operated according to the description. The real world description is communicated to the devices via broadcast signals a web link etc. The devices also include a kind of controller which in WO 02 092183 is called adjusting means for adjusting physical parameters of the devices. The devices are furnished by a browser part that allows reading the description. The disclosure teaches that if the real world description reads then the browser part . . . interprets this into specific instructions relating to the colour tones and luminance level. 

Illumination levels are also known to influence a person s health emotions and mood. For instance light therapy is used to enhance mood and relieve depression particularly during times where a person is little exposed to sunlight. Particular wavelength intensity light sources are typically used. Further lighting has become essential in interior designs including homes and commercial building such retail stores to provide desired functions and aesthetics as well as health benefits such as reducing eyestrain and enhancing moods.

It should be mentioned that aesthetics are particularly derived from a human s intuitive perception. Therefore it becomes increasingly important to design artificial illumination systems in such ways that combine desired physical characteristics of lighting with people s perception of daylight often associated with images of the sun skies green leaves and other phenomena of the nature.

In all aforesaid solutions and many others conventional lighting systems perform their primary function namely providing illumination of a certain level color and configuration. Many kinds of manual electronic and other input devices exist for regulating the degree of illumination.

It is desirable to provide an intuitive way of creation of an artificial atmosphere and a system for its physical realization. Accordingly a lighting system is provided for producing an artificial atmosphere wherein the illumination levels correspond to respective certain images still or streaming video including audio as desired such as of the sun skies etc. The image s are projected or displayed on suitable display means such as ceiling floor walls monitor screens and the like at substantially the same time when a particular illumination level is produced or changed or simply when a switch image controller position is changed.

Such a lighting system and method are based on the insight that a better aesthetic and health effect may be created for a user if certain illumination levels would each correspond to a displayed desirable or desired images such as an image s of the sun the moon blue sky green leaves flowers birds mountains hills waterfalls and other images of the nature and or personal or other images chosen or provided by the end user. It should be understood that image s or picture s as discussed herein include one or a series of still images pictures and or streaming video which may also include audio as desired.

Illustratively the images of scenes include images of the sun in different coordinate positions within the images preferably with different brightness to reproduce the respective phases of day sunlight as well as other images of natural phenomena such as skies moonlight green plants birds water sources different kinds of earth landscape and the like. The images may be stored in memory hard drive chips cards etc. in the form of a list of scripts or in another form.

A suitable input device is provided for example a rotatable or slideable knob or switch or any other user interface implemented by hardware software or firmware for example used for alteration of light levels and or displayed images including for example a graphical user interface which may be stand alone part of or associated with any type of suitable control device or display such as a computer personal digital assistant PDA remote control. For example the user interface may be a touch sensitive screen keyboard mouse and the like. The lighting image system is configured to alter the light levels in response to signals from the input device and to substantially simultaneously display images associated with the selected level e.g. a selected light level or selected images. For example images may be selected and controlled by script s associated with the light image levels wherein a setting a particular light image level also results in displaying images associated with the particular light image level in accordance with the script s . The end user may select particular script s to associate particular images with particular light image levels e.g. set by adjusting a position of the rotary or slideable knob set up by the user so that in response to providing or selecting a light image level a desired associated image is displayed.

The following description of certain exemplary embodiment s is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention its application or uses.

As mentioned a better aesthetic and health effect may be created for the user s if light levels correspond to images desirable to the end user which images may be provided by the user or selected by the user from predefined set of images. Scripts are used to associate the images with various light image levels. The end user may select different scripts or different images or may modify scripts and associated images and light image levels as desired. Illustratively a high illumination level corresponds to a picture of a sunny day including the shining sun bright blue sky and other respective images. An intermediate illumination level increased from a lower level may correspond for example to a sunrise and an increasing of the lighting level is substantially simultaneously or followed by the changing of images or levels thereof e.g. to a movement of the sun to the midday position where the image of the sun becomes brighter. The intermediate illumination level if achieved by decreasing the light image level from a higher level may correspond for example to a sunset and or movement of the sun toward a sunset position. A low illumination level may correspond to the evening sky perhaps with the moonlight on a lake s surface stars etc. Of course a lot of different sets of images may be designed or authored by professional designers and offered to consumers. Of course the consumer may also supply any desired images and associate the images or their levels with any desired light image levels.

In response to user input or upon detecting a presence in a room or being activated by a timer for example the input device issues a selection signal indicative of the light image level selected by the user or the previously set level for example. The selection signal is provided to a lamp controller to select or control the levels and configuration of illumination of light sources or lamps such as lamps in light fixtures.

The selection signal may be used to control various attributes of light emanating from illumination sources as well as to display desired images or image levels by an image renderer . The light source s may be any type of light source such as incandescent fluorescent high intensity discharge HID as well as light emitting diodes LEDs . The lamp controller may be associated with some or all the light sources for example and may be any type of controller such as a ballast for certain types of lamp as is well know in the art. The lamp controller may be part of the input device for example such as a rotatable or slideable knob configured to change the light intensity level in response to movement of the knob. The lamp controller is configured to issue an illumination signal to control various attributes of the light emitted from the lamp s such as intensity color hue saturation and the like where LEDs are well suited for providing light of different attributes.

In response to the selection signal the lamp controller sends the illumination signal to the lamp for changing light attributes emanating therefrom. For simplicity light attributes is referred to as the level or intensity of light but it should be understood that any light attribute may be changed or controlled. Further when referring to one lamp controller and one lamp it should be understood that one lamp controller may control more than one lamp or several lamp controllers may be used to control several lamps or groups of lamps where a script is associated with a desired one of the lamp controllers. Of course different scripts may be associated with different lamp controllers and lamps so that for example different images are displayed on different surfaces or displays in accordance to the script associated with a particular lamp controller and associated lamp s and or image renderers .

The selection signal from the input device is also provided to the system controller which is configured to control at least one rendering device including play back devices displays and or projectors for displaying images on a surface or display device . Of course more than one rendering device may be used instead of a single one and the images may be downloaded from a storage device local or remote though a network such as a local or wide area network including the internet or intranets. Alternatively or in addition the images may be stored on a memory medium magnetic solid state optical or any other type of memory such as DVD for example.

Substantially simultaneously with activating a level of light image intensity or other light attributes for example the system controller controls the rendering device to display images associated with the light level. Scripts may be used that have images associated with different light image levels where in response to the user selected light image level via the input device for example including a manual switch microphone sensors timers or the like an image or a group of images associated to the corresponding illumination level is displayed by the rendering device . Each image or a group of images may be chosen from the pre designed set associated with a predetermined illumination level within the range of said levels of illumination.

A user interface associated with the system controller may be configured to provide the user with a menu of different scripts for selecting one or more scripts as well as associating the one or more scripts with light image levels of one or a group of lights and or rendering devices controlled by one or various lamps controllers and or the system controller . The user interface and or system controller may also be configured to allow the user to change or reprogram scripts or create new scripts to associate any desired images with any light image levels. Of course the user interface may be part of the input device or a stand alone unit including for example a display which may be touch sensitive keyboard mouse remote control device PDA and the like.

As depicted on the system controller is in communication with a memory storing programs which may be provided in the form of scripts or alternatively as downloadable Java applets or using a different technology or written in another programming language wherein each script is associated with a certain image or a group of images. The system controller may have its own memory e.g. ROM RAM or the like to store needed data such as an operating system as is will known in the art. Of course alternatively or in addition some scripts may be associated with a sequence of sounds e.g. the rippling of a water stream voices of birds etc. rendered via an audio renderer or via a combined audio video renderer. The scripts could be stored on appropriate computer chips cards on a hard drive as image files conveniently organized using a database or otherwise or stored on a Website in addition to or instead of being stored in the memory . The system controller may be configured to provide the user e.g. via an associated user interface which may be part of the input device for example or a separate unit a program selector and or modifier so that the user can select modify or create scripts having images with corresponding light image levels of corresponding lamps .

The illumination signal s and selection signal s are generated in such a way that each series of illumination signals for establishing a certain level of illumination substantially relates or are relatable by the user to a certain kind or series of selection signals eventually corresponding to a certain image or image group or levels thereof.

The predetermined or selected script is then interpreted by the system controller and the image or image group corresponding to the particular light image level is rendered by the image renderer and shown to the user via a display device such as a monitor screen or via a projector that projects the image on wall s floor and or ceiling of the room. The image renderer includes an interface to translate the output of the program executed by the processor or system controller into appropriate display control signals enabling the display device to display or project the images for viewing on the ceiling floor walls or special screens arranged in a private room or in a public place. The displaying is provided substantially simultaneously for example with the producing of illumination by the light sources of the desired illumination level entered by the user through the input device .

In another embodiment the selection signal s for example may include a timer signal associated with the selection signal s received from the input device and originated by the user through a timer which may be part of or separate from the input device . In response to such a timer signal the system controller and thus the image renderer may limit the exposition of the current image image group or may change the image s to another predetermined image image group or may act in any desired way. This can be used in a design of a sequence of images which automatically or upon a user s request changes for example the position of the sun the brightness of the sky the opening and closing of flowers following the movement of the sun the sounds of birds different in different phases of the day sunlight and so on.

In another embodiment the input device may receive user voice commands from a microphone which may be part of or separate from the input device instead of or in addition to activating a rotatable or slideable knob or switch which then can be synthesized by proper well known converting means such as voice recognition modules provided within the input device into computer application commands. Illustratively the voice commands include High Medium and Low .

Alternatively or in addition the voice commands may be numerical values such as from one to ten to provide finer gradation of light image levels where one is associated with a low illumination level and ten is associated with a high illumination level for example. Instead of voice the input device may be responsive to sound to turn on off the lights.

Those voice commands may be provided to a voice recognition module for example and converted into signals that influence the selection signals and illumination signals for controlling or choosing a level of illumination desired by the user as described in the command where the selection signals are further sent for processing to the system controller for control of the renderer for desired associated image display. The selection signals may also activate the user interface for selection of any desired light level association with any desired image or image intensity levels or selection and or modification of scripts by the user for example to select images corresponding to the illumination level. One way to accomplish some of these tasks is the use of the aforementioned real world representation system disclosed in International Publication No. WO 02 092183.

The above described embodiments provide a static or dynamic content of the images and lighting sequences. In the case of static content the content always acts in a predictable manner determined by commands received from the input device . Dynamic content of images or their sequences may be provided making the user experience unpredictable and more exciting. For instance the system may work in conjunction with a method for generating an XML based markup language document disclosed in International Publication No WO 03 100548 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The method provides a dynamic content through collecting active markup language fragments in a pool accessing the pool processing the fragments using at least one predetermined factor time content etc. and generating a dynamic content markup language document.

For establishing such fragments different entries to the input device such as from the manual switch microphone user voice commands timers and sensors including the room temperature the starting illumination degree etc. may be transformed by the input device into specific ones of the selection signals further translated by interface means as described for example in the aforementioned WO 03 100548 coupled with the programs stored in the memory into such fragments associated to specific instance parameters set up by the entries. The fragments are further parsed pooled and processed by the system controller according to the above described method e.g. having content as the predetermined factor. As a result the system generates a dynamic content document further interpreted and rendered by the image renderer and displayed in the form of dynamically changing images by the display device . In this way the positions configurations colors of images and the images themselves may be altered on the fly to produce a vast variety of unrepeatable scenes corresponding to the illumination levels.

It will be understood and appreciated that the user interface and system controller may be a custom single purpose lighting control panel especially designed for this application or alternatively the user interface and system controller may be provided in the form of a personal computer that is programmed as needed to perform the desired lighting control logic.

Such scripts or other software including operating system for the system controller and other data can of course be embodied in a computer readable medium such as an integrated chip a peripheral device or memory of the or coupled to system controller which may include a dedicated processor for performing in accordance with the present invention or may be a general purpose processor wherein only one of many functions operates for performing in accordance with the present invention. The processor may operate utilizing a program portion multiple program segments or may be a hardware device utilizing a dedicated or multi purpose integrated circuit. Each of the above systems utilized for light image control may be utilized in conjunction with further systems.

The input device need not control the light source s and may only control the image renderer s through the system controller . For example the input device may be configured to provide on and off conditions and intermediate conditions between the on and off conditions e.g. by rotating sliding or picking such as by pointing using any pointing device such a mouse pointer finger using a keyboard or screen which may be touch sensitive etc. a particular position of a hardware software or firmware implemented switch.

In response to the selected switch condition the image renderer is controlled via the system controller for example to render particular image s having particular intensity or brightness levels for example. Illustratively a first image responsive to the off or low lighting level condition includes a low intensity image or image s having a first scene e.g. a night scene sunrise sunset evening with stars or an image of a fireplace with smoldering embers and a second image responsive to the on or high lighting level condition includes a higher intensity image higher than the low intensity image or image s having a second scene e.g. a day scene bright sun or an image of a fireplace with a roaring fire. A third rendered image or many intermediate images may be responsive to one or many of the intermediate conditions or positions of the input device . The intermediate image s has an intermediate intensity between the low and higher intensities or image s having an intermediate scene s e.g. the sun at different positions with different intensities such as corresponding to different times of day at later times in the day than high intensity but earlier in the day than low intensity such as dusk or sunset etc. associated with the intermediate positions of the input device or the fireplace image with varying fire intensity flicker etc.

Of course instead of dusk or sunset being associated with low intensity sunrise may be associated therewith in which case the intermediate intensity s and or scene s e.g. the sun at different positions with different intensities correspond to different times of day at earlier times in the day than high intensity but later in the day than low intensity such as sunrise etc. associated with the intermediate positions of the input device or the fireplace image with varying fire intensity flicker etc.

The system controller and input device or atmosphere switch may even be configured to control environmental conditions such as heat and or air conditioning to effect environmental changes in correspondence with the light levels selected from the input device . Thus for example when the input device is set to maximum to provide bright light in addition the displayed associated images of bright sun and or roaring fire in a fireplace image the heat system may be turned higher to warm the environment and or the air conditioning decreased to reduce cooling. Conversely in addition to changing the displayed images to the night sky sunrise sunset or a fireplace with the remains of burning wood or smothering embers for example the heat may be turned lower and or air conditioning increased to provide further cooling in response to lowering the input device to lower levels such as to provide lower light intensity levels and cooler temperature.

The intermediate scene and or intensity may depend on the condition prior to the current intermediate condition. For example a first intermediate image s is rendered and or the intensity of the intermediate image s increases from a lower intensity when the intermediate condition is achieved by increasing from the low condition i.e. the low condition or any condition which is lower than the intermediate condition is the condition immediately prior to intermediate condition . Similarly a second intermediate image s is rendered and or the intensity of the intermediate image s decreases from a higher intensity when the intermediate condition is achieved by decreasing from a condition which is higher than the intermediate condition e.g. when the condition immediately prior to intermediate condition is a higher condition than the intermediate condition .
