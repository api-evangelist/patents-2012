This invention pertains generally to systems devices and methods for digital data recording storage and retrieval. More specifically the present invention relates to a data storage library system device and method for recording cataloging storing searching retrieving and providing playback of large volumes of digital computer data such as but not limited to audio video image and text data files utilizing multiple removable disk media stored in a media library.

The high tech arena of today s video security government security applications home theater market medical video and diagnostic imaging and records and large and small data storage applications is ever growing and becoming more lucrative with each product placed in the marketplace. Any new emerging technology in this area offers opportunity for successful market entry. It is estimated that approximately 80 of the consumer electronics business are under 30 million dollars a year in sales. What is remarkable however is that in the current market no true TV PC DVD integrated image capture terabyte and multi terabyte storage solution exists that meets the plethora of current and future government medical industrial and consumer needs.

The goal of HD DVD is to present at least two hour long films in high definition video format at 1080p. Currently DVD technology is limited to resolution of 480p. As a part of these limitations the current DVD red laser technology is limited to 4.7 Gb of storage or 9.4 Gb using double sided or dual layer DVD. However emerging blue laser systems will have the capability of storing capacities of 25 GB to 300 GB or greater per disk in the near future. Systems will be able to achieve 36 Mbps of transfer speed which equates to approximately 2 hours at 1080p resolution or 13 hours of 480p resolution for the 25 GB disks. It is contemplated that 200 Gb dual layer disks and 300 Gb holographic optical storage will soon follow which will allow for even greater storage of recorded media.

Today there exists a variety of audio compact disk CD and digital video disk DVD storage and handling apparatuses. Each apparatus configuration varies in shape and size and can range in shape from toroidal configurations to linear type cartridge stacks. Many typical digital media handling libraries seen today usually function as read only type devices. Sometimes these devices may include a number of areas for containing data cartridges positioned relative to a manipulating arm capable of maneuvering in front of a particular area which contains the desired cartridge to read. In the handling of digital data especially where the recording and viewing of stored data is involved data access speed is sometimes very important to the user. The ability to specifically view recorded media content within a library and then to selectively retrieve and simultaneously play the selection would offer the user a tremendous benefit not currently available.

Optical information storage technologies have provided increasing storage densities over the years. The demand for larger volume optical storage devices has been persistent and various approaches to increased optical storage have been considered. In addition the retrieval of stored disk media has become a significant factor for consideration in view of the proliferation of various uses of these disks for data storage in association with various information that must be readily available. While individual disks are capable of accepting relatively large amounts of data the amount of data stored for many applications is immense and therefore requires a significant number of disks. In addition to requiring large data storage capacity rapid retrieval of disks is also desired so that data from the disks can be accessed more quickly.

There are various devices which store numerous recordable media magnetically or optically containing information therein in a magazine or magazines. The devices position the recordable media at a given location or locations inside the magazines and remove the same therefrom. An example of such a device is a disk changing apparatus. A disk changing apparatus typically stores a large number of disk shaped recordable media such as CDs or DVDs in low density magazines and is provided with a drive read write unit for magnetically or optically recording onto and playing information stored on the disks. The disk changing apparatus is further adapted to set a disk from a magazine into the drive unit and insert a disk from the drive unit into a magazine. Many of these magazines have drawer supports for each disk.

One major factor in determining the efficiency of disk retrieval and delivery is found in the capabilities of the disk retrieval loader apparatus to accomplish disk movement from and to storage libraries and drive mechanisms. Specifically if the disk retrieval loader apparatus is able to quickly retrieve carry and deliver a disk the data from that disk can be made available faster to the user. Thus it is apparent that a need is present for a disk retrieval loader apparatus that can retrieve and load disks in a timely and efficient manner. However before the user can retrieve a disk he she must be able to determine which disk a desired file is on. This is typically done through some form of manual searching within the stored files.

Specifically for example in digital video recorder security systems there are several methods of searching for programs recorded by a user or system. First one method is to search while actually looking at a video by fast forwarding or rewinding a recorded program. Recent developments in digital video recorder software has allowed for faster searching by using camera number time and date or other metadata. These devices facilitate searching for a recorded segment of surveillance video or a TV program while listening to sound by doubling the image speed and maintaining the sound speed at a normal level.

Specifically by way of example only there are devices that facilitate searching for a TV program while listening to sound by doubling the image speed and maintaining the sound speed at a normal level. To increase the efficiency of retrieval great efforts have recently been made to increase the fast forward speed and the rewind speed.

In prior methods a user must look at the screen until he she finds his her desired program. Furthermore fast forwarding and rewinding operations are complicated and troublesome. Such methods depend on user s intuition and memory. Particularly when a program is automatically recorded a user s intuition and memory cannot be relied upon any longer. As more and more video images are stored the user s burden increases.

Other methods index video segments or recorded programs at the time of recording and searching for a desired program by displaying a list of the indices on the screen. Generally speaking recording date and time are used as indices. It is considered that information which can be acquired as the attributes of a program by a video recorder are currently only recording date and time. In the video recorder a list of the recording times and dates of TV programs is displayed on the screen so that a user can search for his her desired program from the list while recollecting his her recording date and time. However in this method a video program must be searched utilizing an index and the user s burden is slightly lightened. But since index information is only recording date and time it can be said that this method also depends on the intuition and memory of a user. Particularly when a program is automatically recorded it is difficult to recall the contents of the recorded program from its recording date and time.

Along with the digitization of TV broadcasting electronic information on TV programs is multiplexed in broadcasting and aired. This electronic program information is generally called EPG Electronic Program Guide . EPG includes key words such as the title category and performers of each program. Current digital satellite broadcasting enables a user to select his her desired channel by displaying this EPG on the screen.

Another method is contained in the EPG and is used as retrieval indices. In this case when a program is recorded EPG is also stored. To see a recorded program the titles of recorded programs are listed on the screen ad a user selects his her desired program from this list. However since EPG indicative of the contents of a program such as the title of a program is used as an index in the previous method the burden of user s intuition and memory is greatly lightened. That is the user searches for his her desired program while looking at the titles of programs. However when a large number of recorded programs can be stored the titles of all the recorded programs cannot be displayed on the screen and the retrieval of indices becomes complicated. Further it is difficult to recall the contents of automatically recorded programs from program information alone.

Along with the spread of digital broadcasting various apparatuses for recording digital video will continue to come into existence. Since the high compression of digital video from digital video recorders is possible a large number of video programs can be recorded. The connection of multiple video cameras used for capturing video images to this storage mechanism is possible.

Further the program recording function will be improved by using the above mentioned EPG. For example it will be possible to record a program by directly specifying the title of the program or to automatically record a program having a keyword by specifying the keyword included in program information such as the category or performer of the program. Particularly the user s history of viewing is analyzed to automatically record a program which seems to be the favorite of the user.

The system s software tracks the location and the contents of each media disk D stored within the system s plurality of removable stacked media magazines . The individual flash memory described above allows a single removable stacked media magazine to be removed from the system and the file contents of the single removable stacked media magazine containing 100 125 disks to be removed with it. The contents of the flash memory and the file structure of the removable stacked media magazine is transferable to one or more of the plurality of hard drive storage units in RAID array of the integrated system .

The flash memory stores information automatically and is accomplished when the removable stacked media magazines are positionally plugged into the system upon installation of the respective removable stacked media magazine . In addition as a removable stacked media magazine is accessed by the microprocessor of the system each media disk D in that removable stacked media magazine s file structure stored in the flash memory will be known and recognized by the microprocessor of the system . More specifically the system computer will recognize specific storage information and will inform the user which miniature shelf the disk D is located in the inner portion separation mechanism .

Similarly video surveillance information from a specific date camera geographic location file size or decimated single frame video images i.e. thumbnails is also recorded on the flash memory . It should be understood that the present invention can also be utilized to store and play video games wherein the flash memory effectively operates in the same manner to provide the user rapid program access and pertinent information relating to the specific media disk D storing the game.

An automated cycle counting inventory management application is provided that provides content verification against the storage file structure that was originally read off of the flash memory . Therefore this provides for situations where a user loads a new removable stacked media magazine with media disks D such that when the removable stacked media magazine is indexed the media disks D may be catalogued for content on an ongoing basis. This function operates independent of whether the system is in use or not. Furthermore the cataloging and maintenance function is provided as an automated feature of the software. Furthermore metadata information about each video file is stored in a metadata catalog that can be searched to find specific stored video and or data and image files of interest.

It can be seen with specific reference to which depicts one of the plurality of disk magazine drawer mechanisms specifically shown is a right side disk magazine drawer mechanism wherein a plurality of media player burner units now labeled in as and for explanatory purposes are removably positioned thereon the disk magazine drawer mechanism . More specifically each of the media player burner units and are operationally positioned in either a top up or top down configuration beneath its respective removable stacked media magazine . For example in media player burner units and are mounted in a top up configuration such that the insertion extraction port allows for insertion of a media disk D to record play from a first side of the media disk D. Alternatively and in addition to player burner units and player burner units and are mounted in a top down configuration such that the insertion extraction port allows for insertion of a media disk D to record play from a second side of the media disk D. Such a top up top down configuration permits the system s components and devices to play and or record on either or both sides of a media disk D that is inserted into the media player burner unit . However as described above alternatively the player burner units may be positioned on one end of the housing body in a stacked configuration.

In reference now to A B A and B the present invention provides for a software controlled gantry device and disk manipulator mechanism that are operationally functionally and communicably connected fore effectuating in combination indexing position translation retrieval grasping placing removing and translational transport of optical disks D from the individual disk insertion extraction ports of the media player recorder units and or one of the removable stacked media magazine in a plurality of axes for effectuating. The gantry device and disk manipulator mechanism components are constructed from a high grade plastic and or aluminum for providing effective interface with the media disks D.

The disk manipulator mechanism according to one embodiment of the present invention interfaces with a media disk D located in a removable stacked media magazine or media player recorder unit and cooperatively interacts therewith the media disk D to retrieve insert the media disk D from into respectively the slot in or drawer of the media player recorder unit one of the removable stacked media magazines or one of the media recorder units . It will be understood that other magazine and player recorder configurations are contemplated for use with the present invention such as but not limited to a toroidal shaped disk media storage carousel not shown or accordion styled carousel not shown . Such alternative shaped storage carousel configurations can be utilized and removably mounted on a carousel transport platform not shown .

The system of the present invention comprises a plurality of various sensors and shown in located on or in association therewith the disk manipulator mechanism the media player burner unit and or the individual disk insertion extraction ports to permit the system to intelligently recognize if a disk is present and in a position relative to each and or . Additional sensors may be provided within the system and are driven by control software provided by the present invention.

In one embodiment of the present invention proximity sensors not shown are utilized with the disk manipulator mechanism to determine and address positional and translational locations in reference to preprogrammed controller coordinates of specific media disk D and removable stacked media magazine locations. However one skilled in the art will recognize that other types of sensors used independently or in combination with the proximity sensors will also permit media disk D and removable stacked media magazine location without departing from the scope of the present invention.

Another type of sensor that can be utilized by the present invention is of the type known as a photointerrupter which in general is a sensor that incorporates an infrared LED and a photosensor within the same packaged unit. Such photointerrupters detect objects when the object interrupts a light beam emitted by an LED within the sensor. Infrared sensors work by sending out a beam of IR light and then computing the distance to any nearby objects employing the characteristics of the returned signal. An example of the sensor used with one embodiment of the present invention is a Sharp GP2A200LCS light modulation reflective type photointerrupter sensor that interfaces directly to the Galil controller and provides an input output signal as to whether or not a media disk D is present.

In continued reference to A B A and B as previously mentioned the system s gantry device and disk manipulator mechanism are functionally operated via at least a plurality of preprogrammed software commands. Such software commands comprise a plurality of specific shelf and removable stacked media magazine address locations for providing translational movement and address commands that instruct the gantry device and or the disk manipulator mechanism separately or in combination and their associated components comprising a plurality of servos others not shown a plurality of drive belts positioned in drive belt grooves two primary drive belts two secondary drive belts and two tertiary drive belts located on both sides of the disk manipulator mechanism s two armed arcuate foundation and articulable driven wheels into proper positioning dependent upon the desired function such as insertion and or retrieval.

Each instructional command and resultant device and component movement is dependant upon on where the disk D is desired to be placed or retrieved. The design disclosed by the present invention permits a media disk D to be removed from the removable stacked media magazine without a pushing force being exerted from an opposite side. Such an advantage allows for less space to be required for operation of the many components and reduces the overall complexity of design.

The disk manipulator mechanism of the present invention comprises a plurality of high traction articulable driven wheels that are driven by servos and or stepper motors . The articulable driven wheels are manufactured so as to have a top guiding chamfer and a high traction grooved gripping surface achieved by coefficient of friction combined with pressure. The wheels may be made from a variety and combinations as desired of angular geometry metal aluminum rubber grit blasting or ceramic coatings. The articulable driven wheels also comprise a bottom guiding chamfer . As can be further seen in driven wheels comprise a top guiding chamfer and a lower reverse chamfer which in combination capture and drive media disks D into the high traction grooved gripping surface located on driven wheels . A tapered throat of about 4 degrees is machined into driven wheels to capture the edge of the media disk D to provide for high contact pressure for adequate traction on the media disk D.

As best depicted in the driven wheels are mounted on wrist sections and which are in turn connected to a two armed arcuate foundation wherein the two armed arcuate foundation articulates about a jawed articulable axis to allow for expansion of the two armed arcuate foundation so as to effectuate proper and adequate travel by the driven wheels around the outer edge diameter of a media disk D thereby permitting a jawed type open and close movement. Connector pulleys made from Delrin or other suitable materials are positioned in each arm of the two armed arcuate foundations to permit primary drive belts or other mechanical drive means driven by servo which is operatively connected to a worm gear not shown that in turn drives a plurality of gears each not shown to simultaneously rotate via the connector pulleys secondary drive belts and tertiary drive belts which in turn cause driven wheels to rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise e.g. dependent upon which side of the two armed arcuate foundation and whether a media disk D is being retrieved or inserted into a magazine or media player recorder unit . Specifically the plurality of components operate to cause each side of the two armed arcuate foundation s wheels gears belts and pulleys to operate in an opposite direction i.e. clockwise or counterclockwise depending upon the desired operation i.e. media disk D extraction or insertion .

The disk manipulator mechanism is transported up and down in a vertical Z axis via a vertical ball screw as best seen in wherein the vertical ball screw is functionally and operationally connected to both the gantry device and the disk manipulator mechanism . The vertical ball screw is rotationally activated by a servo stepper motor and gear combination which in combination are controlled by a plurality of software communication commands from the controller software resident in the Galil controller or similar controller. The disk manipulator mechanism can be rotated degrees in either direction by the vertical ball screw and servo combination without the elevational i.e. up or down position of the disk manipulator mechanism being changed.

In reference specifically to when the software or userselects via the optical mouse the IR keyboard and or an exteriorly installed LCD touch screen device selects a desired media disk D for retrieval from the removable stacked disk magazine the combination gantry device and the disk manipulator mechanism moves into a substantially adjacent position with the media disk D to permit a plurality of high traction grooved gripping surfaces of the plurality of the driven wheels to come into frictional gripping contact with the desired predetermined media disk D.

As can been seen in when the driven wheels come into contact with the edges of the outer edge diameter of the desired media disk D the jawed articulable axis permits an opening expansion of the arcuate foundation thereby allowing the driven wheels to continue travel until each driven wheels is in an approximate relative opposing interim position along the outer edge diameter of the media disk D. During this portion driven wheel devices will rotate counterclockwise and driven wheel devices will rotate clockwise. The driven wheel devices will each continue such rotation until they are past a centerpoint of the opposing interim position and are in a transport position as is generally depicted by the media disk D position within the disk manipulator mechanism shown in . It is at this point that the driven wheel devices rotation is stopped by system software and the disk D is transported for placement into an individual disk insertion extraction port of one of the media player burner unit or into a different removable stacked disk magazine installed on one of the drawers in the main body .

The above process is reversed when the software and or user has finished the desired task playing and or recording with the media disk D. More specifically the disk manipulator mechanism removes the disk D from an individual disk insertion extraction port of one of the media player burner unit or from a removable stacked disk magazine installed on one of the drawers in the main body . Driven wheel devices will be instructed by the system software to rotate clockwise and driven wheel device will be instructed to rotate counterclockwise to hold the disk D in a position similar to the opposing interim position described above to facilitate retrieval of the media disk D. Upon possession of the media disk D by the disk manipulator mechanism the gantry device driven by controlling software and associated components then translationally transports the disk manipulator mechanism left right up and or down into a desired addressed and indexed position relative to the media disk s D previous position in the removable stacked disk magazine or to an alternate vacant shelf slot in the removable stacked disk magazine .

As mentioned above the present invention also allows the user to insert individual media disks D into the at least one front facing exteriorally installed media player recorder as shown in for manually inserting and extracting individual media disks D for playing copying and or recording purposes separate and apart from the players recorders . Upon completion of the desired process recording and or playback the user and or software via system interfaces commands the system to cause the media player recorder unit to eject the disk D to allow removal by the user. The front facing exteriorally installed media player recorder can be front facing or side facing.

As previously mentioned the present invention utilizes a dedicated servo control system manufactured by Galil or other comparable similar device and its dedicated programming language to code objects within the system for operation. The code utilized is for reading a plurality of sensors each not shown and for driving the plurality of servos others not shown that interoperate and intercommunicate with the gantry device and the disk manipulator mechanism .

More specifically and by way of example the plurality of sensors are sensors that are utilized to read properties of the sensor to inform the system that a media disk D is in a media player recorder unit or to inform the system of the location of the media disk D on the disk manipulator mechanism . By further example the plurality of sensors allow the system to detect if there is a disk D in a particular indexed position within the removable stacked media magazine prior to retrieving the media disk D or inserting another media disk D. The code allows query of the sensor to determine whether or not a particular sensor is detecting something at its position.

Similarly the code in the main system processor communicates with the dedicated Galil or the like servo controller to determine its relative position in a particular axis and to specify the speed and amount and degree of servo rotation needed to carry out a specific task. The servos control at least but not limited to the gantry device the disk manipulator mechanism the ball screw and the driven wheels 

The plurality of servos others not shown in communication with the gantry device and the disk manipulator mechanism utilize servo mechanical position information programmed into servo controller software to determine instruct and address proper disk D pick up and drop off positions. For example a disk drop off position address may be for a specific individual disk insertion extraction port of a specific player burner unit and a pick up position may be from one of the miniature shelves located on the inner portion separation mechanism of one of the removable stacked media magazines .

The disk manipulator mechanism of the present invention provides ideal functionality to solve applications which require fast repeatable and articulate point to point movements to remove items such as media disks D. Because of its unique X Y Z and axis translation motions the combination of the gantry device and the disk manipulator mechanism are ideal for use with the present invention in that constant acceleration through motions for dispensing the media disk D into a desired position is desired.
