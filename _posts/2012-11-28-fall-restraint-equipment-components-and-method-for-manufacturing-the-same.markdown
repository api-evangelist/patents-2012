The present application claims the benefit of the U.S. patent Ser. No. 12 537 842 filed on Aug. 7 2009 by Robert W. Honeycutt and entitled for FALL RESTRAINT EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 087 732 filed on Aug. 10 2008 by Robert W. Honeycutt for COMPONENTS OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND METHODS FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME the entire disclosure of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to fall restraint equipment components. More particularly embodiments of the present invention relate to handrails and swing gates for fall restraint equipment.

Referring to handrail is typically manufactured by cutting or drilling stock materials into a desired size and then welding the cut pieces together. For instance side beams and cross beams are cut from tubular pieces of steel. Cross beams are welded to side beams denoted by welds . In this example beams and are welded at areas wherever the beams intersect. Because the stock materials are typically not designed for the intended use of the pieces they must be drilled or cut to match the specifications of the pieces end use. Manufacturing a handrail such as handrail in this manner is both time consuming and costly. Additionally the drilling and cutting of the stock material must be accomplished with precision in order to create a stable end product. Variances greater than an acceptable level render the smaller pieces unusable which are typically discarded as they often are unusable in another product once they have been drilled or cut. Additionally if other parts cannot be cut or drilled from the remaining portions of the stock materials they too are discarded. This also increases the costs associated with manufacturing the end product such as handrails .

Repeat use of reference characters in the present specification and drawings is intended to represent same or analogous features or elements of the invention.

Reference will now be made in detail to presently preferred embodiments of the invention one or more examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention not limitation of the invention. In fact it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. For instance features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

In operation swing gate is attached to another structure such as a walkway or a handrail via hinges . Swing gate may be connected to another structure by an optional latch or other securing mechanism on the side of the gate opposite hinges . Hinges allow gate to rotate with respect to the first structure while latch enables a user to secure the swing gate in place. Hinges may be spring loaded in order to urge swing gate back into a closed position after the gate has been opened. In such an embodiment a tab is preferably attached to the side of outer rail opposite the side on which hinges are attached. It should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the tab may either replace latch of may be located adjacent the latch such as on the opposite surface of outer rail from the latch. The tab extends beyond the edge of gate so that the tab comes in contact with the adjacent structure such as a handrail in order to prevent the gate from rotating beyond the desired position as it is urged back to the closed position by hinges .

In an exemplary embodiment the height of handrail and of swing gate is approximately 48 inches but it should be understood that the handrail and gate may be constructed to exhibit various heights and widths depending on the intended use and purpose of each. Accordingly additional midrails similar to midrails and respectively may be included to provide additional fall restraint depending on the desired size and configuration of the handrail or swing gate.

Referring to a tube laser may be used to laser or otherwise cut continuous pieces and of tubular metal and continuous piece of sheet metal in order to form outer rail midrail and toeboard respectively. Likewise tube laser may be used to cut continuous pieces of tubular and sheet metal configured to form outer rail midrail and toeboard . Continuous pieces or of metal is inserted into a holding mechanism of tube laser which moves and rotates the continuous piece while a COlaser penetrates the metal. In this manner tube laser lasers or cuts continuous piece of metal to form the indentations and apertures described above. Tube laser further comprises a processor and a processor readable medium containing computer instructions that when executed by the processor perform the function of providing a graphical user interface GUI . The GUI allows a user to provide tube laser with the desired dimensions of continuous piece of metal and the location and dimensions of the portions of the piece that need to be cut and removed in order to form outer rail . Based on these instructions provided by the user which are stored on the processor readable medium the processor instructs tube laser and more specifically holding mechanism and laser how to rotate move and cut continuous piece of metal. It should be understood that other suitable processes may be utilized to cut continuous piece of metal to form outer rail including the use of a cutting drill a screw machine or a handheld plasma or flame torch.

Referring additionally to continuous piece of metal is cut to form outer rail in a manner similar to that described above with respect to outer rail of . That is continuous piece of tubular metal is cut along dashed lines and in order to define apertures and respectively. Likewise continuous piece of tubular metal is cut along dashed lines and to define areas and respectively. The lower portions of each area and are configured to receive the head of respective bolts as explained in more detail below.

Outer rail is then folded in a manner similar to that described above with respect to . Likewise handrail is formed from outer rail midrail and toeboard in a manner similar to that described above with respect to . Those of ordinary skill in the art should understand that brackets are not attached however to outer rail or handrail in this embodiment.

Referring to handrail is positioned adjacent a fixed structure in order to mount the handrail to the structure. A pair of bolts is attached to fixed structure at locations corresponding to the distal ends of handrail that define areas and . Each bolt attached to structure is threaded and configured to receive a respective nut. In the example provided by a combination of a nut and bolt is located vertically above a combination of another nut and bolt on a front surface of structure . The lower portions of areas and are configured to receive the combinations and of the nuts and bolts respectively.

In operation handrail is positioned so that areas and are located near combinations and as illustrated in . Handrail is then positioned so that combinations and are received by the lower portions of areas and respectively as illustrated in . In this regard the nut portion of each combination extends into the interior of continuous piece of tubular metal of handrail beyond the surface of the handrail defining the two areas. Next handrail is lowered until the top portion of areas and rest on the bolt portions of combinations and respectively as denoted by arrow in . As a result combinations and of the nuts and bolts slide into the respective upper portions of areas and . That is the edges defining the upper portions of areas and engage and separate the nut portion of combinations and respectively from the surface of structure to which the bolts are affixed. Those of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that handrail is thus affixed to structure as illustrated in due to the relatively greater circumference exhibited by the nuts of combinations and than the circumference exhibited by the upper relatively narrower portions of areas and . That is it should be understood that the upper portions of areas and are configured to prevent the nuts of combinations and from passing through the upper portions. The force exerted by gravity on handrail maintains the handrail in a lowered fixed position. The sides of areas and continue to engage the nuts of combinations and respectively.

It should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the above description discloses a process for manufacturing a handrail or a swing gate from a continuous pieces of metal. The outer rail of the handrail or swing gate is notched or indented at two locations and then folded at the indentations. During manufacture the outer rail is also notched in order to allow areas of additional pieces to be inserted into the outer rail to provide for a complete connection between the two. The additional pieces and the outer rail may be welded together if desired. It should be apparent that forming a handrail or swing gate in the manner described above reduces the amount of time and materials required in comparison to convention handrails and swing gates thereby lowering the overall cost of the product.

While one or more preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above it should be understood that any and all equivalent realizations of the present invention are included within the scope and spirit thereof. The embodiments depicted are presented by way of example only and are not intended as limitations upon the present invention. Thus it should be understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the present invention is not limited to these embodiments since modifications can be made. Therefore it is contemplated that any and all such embodiments are included in the present invention as may fall within the scope and spirit thereof.
