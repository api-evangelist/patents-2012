The present invention teaches customized articles of footwear including removable and replaceable components and methods of making the same.

The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element which can provide improved cushioning stability and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper insole spring element and sole can be selected from a range of options and can be easily removed and replaced as desired. Further the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly the article of footwear can be customized by an individual wearer or specially configured for a select target population in order to optimize desired performance criteria. Moreover the present invention teaches a method of making an article of footwear and also a way of doing both retail and Internet business.

Conventional athletic footwear typically include an outsole made of a thermoset rubber compound which is affixed by adhesive to a midsole made of ethylene vinyl acetate or polyurethane foam material which is in turn affixed by adhesive to an upper which is constructed with the use of stitching and adhesives. Because of the difficulty time and expense associated with renewing any portion of conventional articles of footwear the vast majority are generally discarded at the end of their service life. This service life can be characterized as having a short duration when a wearer frequently engages in athletic activity such as distance running or tennis. In tennis portions of the outsole can be substantially abraded within a few hours and in distance running the foam midsole can become compacted and degrade by taking a compression set within one hundred miles of use. The resulting deformation of the foam midsole can degrade cushioning and footwear stability thus contribute to the origin of athletic injuries. Accordingly many competitive distance runners who routinely cover one hundred miles in a week s time will discard their athletic footwear after logging three hundred miles in order to avoid possible injury.

Even though the service life of conventional athletic footwear is relatively short the price of athletic footwear has steadily increased over the last three decades and some models now bear retail prices over one hundred and twenty dollars. However some of this increase in retail prices has been design and fashion driven as opposed to reflecting actual value added. In any case conventional athletic footwear remain disposable commodities and few are being recycled. The method of manufacture and disposal of conventional athletic footwear is therefore relatively inefficient and not environmentally friendly. In contrast with conventional athletic footwear the present invention teaches an article of footwear that can include a spring element which does not take a compression set or similarly degrade thus the physical and mechanical properties afforded by a preferred article of footwear can remain substantially the same over a useful service life which can be several times longer than that of conventional articles of footwear. The present invention teaches an article of footwear which represents an investment as opposed to a disposable commodity. Like an automobile the preferred article of footwear includes components which can be easily renewed and replaced but also components which can be varied and customized as desired.

Conventional athletic footwear cannot be substantially customized for use by the customer or wearer. The physical and mechanical properties of conventional athletic footwear are relatively fixed generic qualities. However the body weight or mass and characteristic running technique of different individuals having the same footwear size can vary greatly. Often the stiffness in compression of the foam material used in the midsole of athletic shoes can be too soft for individuals who employ more forceful movements or who have greater body mass than an average wearer. Accordingly conventional articles of athletic footwear do not provide optimal performance characteristics for individual wearers.

In contrast the present invention permits a wearer to customize a preferred article of footwear. For example the length width girth and configuration of the upper as provided by various last options or by two or three dimensional modeling and footwear design equipment including computer software and data storage and retrieval systems or by two or three dimensional measurement devices such as scanners as well as the type of footwear construction and design of the upper can be selected by the customer or wearer. Further the physical and mechanical properties of the article of footwear can be selected and changed as desired in order to optimize desired performance characteristics given various performance criteria or environmental conditions. For example the configuration and geometry of the article of footwear and the stiffness of the spring elements can be customized as desired. In addition the ability to easily remove renew and recycle the outsole portions of the preferred article of footwear can render the use of softer materials having enhanced shock and vibration dampening characteristics but perhaps diminished wear properties viable from a practical standpoint. Moreover the outsole portion of the preferred article of footwear can be selected from a variety of options with regards to configuration materials and function.

The physical and mechanical properties associated with an article of footwear of the present invention can provide enhanced cushioning stability and running economy relative to conventional articles of footwear. The spring to dampening ratio of conventional articles of footwear is commonly in the range between 40 60 percent whereas the preferred article of footwear can provide a higher spring to dampening ratio thus greater mechanical efficiency and running economy. In this regard the article of footwear can include a spring element that underlies the forefoot area which can store energy during the latter portion of the stance phase and early portion of the propulsive phase of the running cycle and then release this energy during the latter portion of the propulsive phase thus facilitating improved running economy. It is believed the resulting improvement in running performance can approximate one second over four hundred meters when running at four minutes mile pace.

The preferred article of footwear can provide differential stiffness in the rearfoot area so as to reduce both the rate and magnitude of pronation or alternately the rate and magnitude of supination experienced by an individual wearer thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury. Likewise the preferred article of footwear can provide differential stiffness in the midfoot and forefoot areas so as to reduce both the rate and magnitude of inward and or outward rotation of the foot thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury. The preferred spring elements can also provide a stable platform which can prevent or reduce the amount of deformation caused by point loads thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury.

The use of relatively soft outsole materials having improved shock and vibration dampening characteristics can enhance cushioning effects. Further in conventional articles of footwear the shock and vibration generated during rearfoot impact is commonly transmitted most rapidly to a wearer through that portion of the outsole and midsole which has greatest stiffness and this is normally a portion of the sole which is proximate the heel of the wearer that undergoes the greatest deflection and deformation. However in the present invention a void space can exist beneath the heel of a wearer and the ground engaging portion of the outsole. Some of the shock and vibration generated during the rearfoot impact of an outsole with the ground support surface must then travel a greater distance through the outsole and inferior spring element in order to be transmitted to the superior spring element and a wearer. In addition in the present invention a posterior spacer which can serve as a shock and vibration isolator and also vibration decay time modifiers can be used to decrease the magnitude of the shock and vibration transmitted to the wearer of a preferred article of footwear.

There are many published examples of attempts to introduce functional spring elements into articles of footwear e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 357 062 U.S. Pat. No. 1 088 328 U.S. Pat. No. 1 107 894 U.S. Pat.

No. 6 330 757 U.S. Pat. No. 6 324 772 B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 393 731 B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 416 610 French Patent 472 735 Italian Patent 633 409 European Patent Applications EP 0 890 321 A2 EP 1 048 233 A2 EP 1 033 087 A1 EP 1 025 770 A2 EP 1 240 838 A1 and PCT Patent Application WO 98 07341 all of these patents and patent applications hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Relatively few of these attempts have resulted in functional articles of footwear which have met with commercial success. The limitations of some of the prior art has concerned the difficulty of meeting the potentially competing criteria associated with cushioning and footwear stability. In other cases the manufacturing costs of making prior art articles of footwear including spring elements have been prohibitive. Articles of footwear including discrete foam cushioning elements which have been commercialized include the Nike SHOX the Adidas a3 which is believed to be taught in European Patent Application EP 1 240 838 A1 the Avia ECS Cushioning and Avia ECS Stability and also the Dada SoleSonic Force. 

The spring element and various other novel structures taught in the present invention can be used in a wide assortment of articles of footwear including but not limited to those used for running walking basketball tennis volleyball cross training baseball football golf soccer cycling sandals hiking boots and army boots. The present invention teaches an article of footwear which can provide a wearer with improved cushioning and stability running economy and an extended service life while reducing the risks of injury normally associated with footwear degradation. The preferred article of footwear provides a wearer with the ability to customize the fit but also the physical and mechanical properties and performance of the article of footwear. Moreover the preferred article of footwear is economical and environmentally friendly to both manufacture and recycle.

The present invention also teaches articles of footwear including means for adjusting the provided foot shape length width and girth. For example spring elements anterior outsole elements stability elements and uppers having different configurations and also alternate positions for selectively affixing various portions of an upper can be used to adjust and customize the fit of an article of footwear for an individual wearer. The upper can also include elastic or elongation means for adjusting the width girth and foot shape. The components of the article of footwear possibly including but not limited to the upper insole cushioning means such as a spring element and sole can be selected from a range of options and can be easily removed and replaced as desired. Further the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly the article of footwear can be configured and customized for a wearer or a select target population in order to optimize performance criteria as desired.

Moreover the present invention teaches a method of making articles of footwear and way of doing both retail and Internet business. For example the anatomical features configuration and dimensions of a given wearer s foot and any other special needs requirements or preferences can be recorded by direct communication observation and measurement in a retail or medical setting or alternately by a wearer or other individual within their home or other remote site and this data can be used to generate information and intelligence relating to making a custom article of footwear. Conventional measuring or reproduction means such as rulers measuring tapes Brannock devices two or three dimensional scanners pressure sensors infrared thermography stereolithography photographs photocopies FAX e mail cameras images tracings video television computers and computer screens software data storage and retrieval systems templates molds models and patterns can be used to help determine and make selections relating to an individual s foot shape length width girth and the like.

Given the provision of an adequate and ready stock of the various components anticipated for use in making the preferred articles of footwear and the information and intelligence created from the data relating to an individual wearer or target population a worker and or automated system can assemble and make a customized article of footwear within five minutes. In fact it is possible to assemble a custom article of footwear according to the present invention in less than one minute using a single fastener. This can be accomplished at the point of purchase or service center which can be located in a retail store medical facility or remote manufacturing environment. Accordingly similar to the rapid delivery eyewear service centers and retail stores which presently exist a customer can now also be provided with a custom article of footwear within minutes. Alternately if and when an individual s data is received from a remote site at the Website or other address of a company which practices the present invention and transmitted to a manufacturing or assembly center a custom article of footwear can be made and possibly delivered to an individual s home or other designated address by same day or overnight service as desired.

The present invention teaches a method of making a custom article of footwear. The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element that can provide improved cushioning stability and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper insole heel counter spring element and sole can be selected from a range of options and can be easily removed and replaced as desired.

A preferred article of footwear can include an anterior side a posterior side a medial side a lateral side a superior side an inferior side a longitudinal axis a transverse axis an upper a sole cushioning means such as a spring element comprising a superior spring element and an inferior spring element and fastening means such as a mechanical fastener including male and female parts or self adhesive means. The superior spring element can extend substantially between the posterior side and the anterior side of the article of footwear and be substantially positioned within the upper in order to secure the upper to the superior spring element. The inferior spring element and the sole can be substantially positioned inferiorly and externally with respect to the upper and the superior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the inferior spring element by at least one fastener. The article of footwear can further include an upper having a plurality of openings on the inferior side in the forefoot area. Further an anterior outsole element including a backing can be at least partially positioned within the upper. However the substantial portion of the anterior outsole element including the ground engaging portion and a plurality of traction members can project through the openings in the upper thus the substantial portion of the anterior outsole element can nevertheless be substantially positioned inferiorly and externally relative to the upper. In an alternate embodiment the article of footwear can further include an upper having a plurality of openings on the inferior side but also on a portion of the medial side lateral side and anterior side in the forefoot area and the anterior outsole element can then include a backing having an elevated profile and traction members that extend upwards about a portion of the medial side lateral side and anterior side of the upper. In an alternate embodiment the anterior portion of the outsole can be removably affixed to the external side of the upper with the use of other fastening means.

The article of footwear can possibly further include an insole a stability element a sole including an anterior outsole element a middle outsole element and a posterior outsole element having a backing and also closure means such as an elastic upper shoe laces a strap including VELCRO hook and pile or a strap including openings and eyelets for receiving conventional shoe laces. A strap can encompass the medial side lateral side inferior side and superior side of the upper. An alternate embodiment of a strap can also include a portion that encompasses the posterior side of the upper. In any case a strap can be selectively removable and replaceable. In an alternate embodiment the upper can be over lasted that is over sized in order to accommodate a removable and replaceable midsole cushioning element which can be inserted into the upper between the top portion of the insole and inferior side of upper.

The insole can include an elevated profile about the medial side lateral side anterior side and posterior side for protecting a wearer s foot from contact with an elevated portion of an anterior outsole element stability element side support or heel counter. The insole can include a heel pad toe pad bottom and side portions having different thickness for selectively adjusting the effective length and width of the article of footwear. The inferior side of the upper can include an opening in the rearfoot area for positioning a removable and replaceable cushioning element such as a fluid filled bladder or a resilient foam material. The superior side of an insole can then include a window in the rearfoot area for viewing a removable and replaceable cushioning element such as a fluid filled bladder or a resilient foam material. A fluid filled bladder can be positioned between a superior spring element posterior spring element or external heel counter and the inferior spring element.

The inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element and can project rearward and downward therefrom forming a V shape. The superior spring element can further include an anterior spring element and a posterior spring element affixed together in functional relation and the inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the posterior spring element. The anterior spring element and posterior spring element can be affixed together in an overlapping relationship. The anterior spring element can further include a projection and the posterior spring element can include a recess for accommodating the anterior spring element. The superior spring element can have a configuration generally corresponding to the bottom net of the last of an article of footwear and can either be generally planar or curved. At least a portion of the superior spring element can be curved to mate with the anatomy of a wearer. Further a superior spring element can possibly also include a side stabilizer or a heel counter. The heel counter can be integral to the superior spring element or alternately be a separate component. The upper can be trapped and secured in functional relation between an external heel counter and an overlaying superior spring element. An advantageous thickness for an external heel counter for a wearer having a given body weight can be approximately 2.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100 140 pounds 2.5 mm for a body weight in the range between 140 180 pounds and 3.0 mm for a body weight in the range between 180 220 pounds.

An anterior spring element can have a curved shape and incorporate toe spring. The amount of toe spring incorporated in an anterior spring element can be in the range between 0 40 mm and in particular in the range between 10 30 mm. A substantial portion of the anterior spring element can extend anterior of 50 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side of the upper whereas a substantial portion of the inferior spring element can extend within 50 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side of the upper.

The inferior spring element can include a longitudinal axis a transverse axis and a flexural axis. The flexural axis can be consistent with the transverse axis. An inferior spring element including a flexural axis consistent with the transverse axis can have a symmetrical configuration on both the medial side and lateral side. Alternately an inferior spring element including a flexural axis consistent with the transverse axis can have an asymmetrical configuration and can have greater concavity downwards adjacent the transverse axis on the medial side than on the lateral side. Alternately the inferior spring element can include a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 10 50 degrees. In particular given an average individual wearer who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker it can be advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20 30 degrees in footwear intended for walking or running. Accordingly the length of the effective lever arm on the medial side of the inferior spring element will be shorter than that on the lateral side that is as measured between the posterior side of the inferior spring element and the location of the flexural axis on each respective side. One way of expressing the length differential of the effective lever arms of the inferior spring element on the medial side versus the lateral side is with a ratio. In this regard it can be advantageous for effecting rearfoot stability that the ratio of the length of the effective lever arms on the lateral side relative to those on the medial side be in the range between 1 1 to 2 1 and in particular in the range between 1.25 1 to 2 1 and preferably in the range between 1.25 1 to 1.75 1.

Further in a men s size 9 article of footwear the posteriormost position of the flexural axis on the medial side can be in the range between 1 6 inches from the posterior side of the upper and in particular in the range between 2 4 inches from the posterior side of the upper. An inferior spring element including a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis can have a symmetrical configuration on both the medial side and lateral side. Alternately an inferior spring element including a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis can have an asymmetrical configuration and can have greater concavity downwards adjacent the transverse axis on the medial side than on the lateral side. Whether the flexural axis be consistent with the transverse axis or be deviated therefrom an inferior spring element having a symmetrical configuration on the medial side and lateral side can include an anterior portion extending between its anterior side and an anterior tangent point a middle portion including an anterior curve extending between the anterior tangent point and a posterior tangent point and a posterior portion extending between the posterior tangent point and the posterior side of said inferior spring element. It can be advantageous that the anterior curve be configured to have a fitted symmetrical radius of curvature. Moreover the posterior portion of the inferior spring element can be inclined or include a posterior curve.

The inferior spring element can attain maximum separation from the superior spring element at a position anterior of the posterior side of the inferior spring element and can substantially maintain the maximum separation between that position and the posterior side of the inferior spring element. Alternately the inferior spring element can attain maximum separation from the superior spring element at a position anterior of the posterior side of the inferior spring element and the separation can then be decreased between that position and the posterior side of the inferior spring element. The inferior spring element can be concave downwards near the anterior side of the inferior spring element but can be concave upwards or convex near the posterior side of the inferior spring element. The inferior spring element can be made in a laminate configuration or structure. The inferior spring element can be made in a tapered configuration or structure. An inferior spring element can exhibit less stiffness in compression on the lateral side relative to the medial side and it can be advantageous for walking and running activity that the differential stiffness be in the range between two to three to one.

The spring element can be made of a fiber composite material and an unidirectional carbon fiber composite material including a toughened epoxy can be preferred for use. Alternately the spring element can be made of a metal material such as spring steel or titanium. The spring element is preferably made of a material having spring characteristics such that the material is capable of storing and returning at least 70 percent of the mechanical energy imparted thereto. In this regard a preferred fiber composite material or alternately a metal material such as spring steel or spring grade titanium is capable of storing and returning at least 90 percent of the energy imparted thereto when their mechanical characteristics are measured using test method ASTM 790.

The superior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 0.5 10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include an anterior spring element or forefoot area having a thickness in the range between 0.5 2.5 mm and in particular in the range between 1.0 1.75 mm. The superior spring element can also include a posterior spring element having a thickness in the range between 1 10 mm. When the superior spring element or posterior spring element has a three dimensional shape in the rearfoot area including an integral heel counter or side counters the superior spring element or posterior spring element can generally have a thickness in the range between 1 5 mm. Further a spring element can include areas having different thickness notches slits or openings which can serve to produce differential stiffness characteristics when the spring element is loaded. In this regard the superior spring element or anterior spring element in the forefoot area can include at least one longitudinal notch or slit and also a plurality of transverse notches or slits on the medial side and lateral side for influencing the flexural modulus and torsional characteristics in a desired manner. It can sometimes be advantageous for the transverse notches or slits on the lateral side to extend for a greater distance relative to those present on the medial side and also for a pair of opposing notches or slits on the medial side and lateral side to approximately correspond the position of the metatarsal phalangeal joints that is be positioned between 60 70 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side. The spring element can include different types orientations configurations and numbers of fiber composite layers in different areas in order to achieve differential stiffness when the spring element is loaded. Accordingly the flexural modulus or stiffness exhibited by a spring element in the rearfoot area midfoot area forefoot area and also that exhibited about any axis can be engineered as desired. In this regard it can be advantageous to create a region of reduced stiffness that is a forefoot strike zone on the lateral side in the area approximately corresponding to the location of a wearer s metatarsal phalangeal joints.

The inferior spring element can provide deflection in the range between 5 50 mm. For example deflection approximately in the range between 8 15 mm could be selected by some wearers for a training shoe intended for use in running at a relatively fast pace a racing flat or a track spike. Alternately deflection approximately in the rage between 15 50 mm could be selected by some wearers for a training shoe intended for use in running at a relatively slow pace. The inferior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 3 10 mm. The superior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 0.5 10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include a forefoot area or anterior spring element having a thickness in the range between 0.5 2.5 mm and in particular in the range between 1.0 1.75 mm. Generally regarding a men s size 9 article of footwear an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches the width in the range between 75 85 mm the vertical elevation is in the range between 10 18 mm and the thickness is in the range between 4 5.5 mm at the anterior side and in the range between approximately 2 3 mm at the posterior side. Generally an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature for use in a men s size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches an advantageous radius of curvature with respect to the superior side of the posterior curve is in the range between 7 and 11 inches and an advantageous radius of curvature regarding the inferior side of the posterior portion is in the range between 4 6 inches. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20 30 degrees.

In particular an inferior spring element for possible use with a men s size 9 article of footwear can have an overall length of 5.25 inches and the anterior portion can measure 1.125 inches the middle portion can measure 2.5 inches and the posterior portion can measure 1.625 inches. Alternately the overall length can be reduced by 0.25 inch by subtracting 0.125 inches from both the anterior portion and the posterior portion. Further the inferior spring element can have a maximum width in the range between 75 80 mm and the flexural axis can be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20 30 degrees. The anterior portion of the inferior spring element can also project downwards at a three degree angle towards the anterior side. This can facilitate attaining an advantageous geometry and fit with respect to a superior spring element and also an external heel counter. The fitted symmetrical radius of curvature of the anterior curve can have a radius of 2.606 inches whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side of the posterior curve can be 9.0 inches and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side of the posterior portion can be 5.138 inches. The vertical elevation of the inferior spring element can be 0.6299 inches or 16 mm and the thickness of an inferior spring element for a wearer having a body weight of approximately 140 160 pounds can be 0.189 inches or 4.8 mm at the anterior side and tapering to only 0.1083 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side. If and when desired the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10 18 mm something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature associated with the anterior curve to also change but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight running technique or characteristic running speeds and also for use in many different activities. Given an inferior spring element having the dimensions recited in this paragraph the following general guidelines regarding the desired thickness for a wearer could apply a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100 120 pounds 4.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 120 140 pounds 4.5 mm for a wearer in the range between 140 160 pounds 4.75 mm for a wearer in the range between 160 180 pounds 5.0 mm for a wearer in the range between 180 200 pounds and 5.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 200 220 pounds.

The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element which can provide improved cushioning stability and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper insole spring element and sole can be selected from a range of options and can be easily removed and replaced as desired. The present invention also teaches an article of footwear including means for adjusting the length width girth and foot shape. Further the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly the article of footwear can be customized by a wearer or specially configured for a select target population in order to optimize desired performance criteria. Moreover the present invention teaches a novel method of manufacturing an article of footwear and also a novel way of doing both retail and Internet business.

A mechanical fastener can be made e.g. of metal ceramic composite thermoplastic or thermoset materials. Threaded nuts and bolts rivets pop rivets push rivets snap rivets snaps hooks clips mating male and female structures quarter turn fasteners bayonet style fasteners quick release fasteners and the like can be used as a fastener. Preferred metals for use in a fastener can include aluminum stainless steel titanium zinc coated steel and other metals or treatments that are resistant to substantial degradation caused normal oxidation and corrosion. Thermoplastic snap rivets and push rivets made and distributed by Richco Inc. of Chicago Ill. are shown in . A large variety of fasteners are made e.g. by Penn Engineering Manufacturing Corporation of Danboro Pa. Avibank Manufacturing Inc. of Burbank Calif. Atlas Engineering of Kent Ohio Stayfast Products Inc. of Fort Mill S.C. DFS International Inc. of Orlando Fla. and Fairchild Inc. of Simi Valley Calif. Shown in is a standard full hex blind threaded insert made by Atlas Engineering Inc. and similar configurations are also available from Stayfast Products Inc. Armand Savoie of MacNeill Engineering of Marlborough Mass. is the inventor of so called Q lock fasteners taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6 151 805 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 332 281 and these patents are hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Fasteners having a threaded portion which further include a portion that can be collapsed or crimped in order to grip a portion of a structure into which they are being fitted are known in the prior art. When a thermoplastic material is used a fastener can possibly be formed or affixed in position with the use of heat and pressure welding adhesive polymerization and then later be removed by destructive method or again with the use of heat and pressure. For example the distal end of a male portion of a fastener can be melted and formed into a rivet like shape with the use of heat and pressure. When a thermoset material is used a fastener can possibly be formed or affixed in position with the use of heat and pressure polymerization vulcanization and later be removed with the use of heat and pressure or destructive method. Contact adhesives and light cure adhesives can also be used to create or affix a fastener.

Preferably a selectively removable and replaceable mechanical fastener can be used thus enabling some or all of the components of a spring element and an article of footwear to be removed and replaced as desired. A fastener can include Allen head or star drive mechanical mating configurations for use with a like installation and removal tool. If desired a fastener can also be torque limited so as to tighten to an appropriate and desired maximum torque value. So called smart bolts developed for NASA which are known by the tradename INTELLIGENT FASTENER and made by Ultrafast Inc. of Malvern Pa. can be used. Fasteners known in the prior art having a male portion including threads that are coated with a thermoplastic or other locking material or alternately a fastener having a female portion including a thermoplastic or other locking material can also be used in order to prevent loosening during use. Moreover fasteners including mating male and female parts which can be easily and quickly coupled and released by so called quarter turn bayonet or quick release structures and methods can be advantageous for use. In this regard the thickness of a superior spring element inferior spring element and upper can be known thus standardized or graded for various sizes of an article of footwear. Accordingly it is possible to design and engineer fasteners including mating male and female parts that can be easily and quickly coupled and released by so called quarter turn bayonet or quick release structures and methods. Moreover alternate inferior spring elements having different thickness within an engineered and preferred selected range can be accommodated and used as desired.

Again it can be readily understood that other conventional means can be used to affix the upper in functional relation to the spring element and outsole such as VELCRO hook and pile or other mechanical engagement means and devices. For example as shown in a portion of the posterior outsole element can slip over and trap a portion of the inferior spring element and then be secured with fasteners . Further at least one hook can extend from the backing of anterior outsole element and engage a portion of the upper or the superior spring element as a portion of the outsole is attached to a preferred article of footwear .

Also shown in is an upper including a heel counter tip vamp anterior side posterior side medial side top or superior side bottom or inferior side forefoot area midfoot area rearfoot area midsole a spring element including an inferior spring element an outsole including an anterior outsole element and posterior outsole element having a tread or ground engaging surface and the presence of toe spring . The upper can be made of a plurality of conventional materials known in the footwear art such as leather natural or synthetic textile materials paper or cardboard stitching adhesive thermoplastic material foam material and natural or synthetic rubber. Since the various components of a preferred article of footwear can be easily removed and replaced a wearer can select a custom upper having a desired size shape design construction and functional capability. The article of footwear can also include means for customizing the shape width and fit of the upper such as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5 729 912 U.S. Pat. No. 5 813 146 U.S. Pat. No. 6 442 874 B1 WO 99 24498 A2 and the like the recited patents and patent application hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Further the present invention teaches novel devices and methods for customizing the width girth and last or foot shape of the preferred article of footwear as discussed in greater detail below. Moreover the article of footwear can include a custom insole using light cure material as taught in the applicant s U.S. Pat. No. 5 632 057 and also U.S. Pat. No. 6 939 502 entitled Method of Making Custom Insoles and Point of Purchase Display both of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.

The upper can be made with the use conventional patterns materials and means known in the prior art. Accordingly an upper can include a natural or synthetic textile material such as a woven or knit fabric and the like. It can be readily understood that the textile material can consist of a three dimensional textile material a multi layer textile material water resistant or waterproof materials shape memory textile materials or stretchable and elastic textile materials and the like. The textile material included in the upper can also be formed by three dimensional or circular knitting methods known in the prior art such as in the manufacture of socks and a suitable pattern for use can be derived or cut therefrom.

Alternately the textile material forming at least a portion of the upper can be made in the origami like patterns taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5 604 997 granted to Dieter U.S. Pat. No. 5 729 918 granted to Smets U.S. Pat. No. 6 295 679 B1 granted to Chenevert patent applications WO 02 13641 A1 by Long and WO 02 23641 A1 by Kilgore et al. and the like all of these patents and patent applications being assigned to Nike Inc. Further the upper can be made in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6 237 251 granted to Litchfield et al. and also those of U.S. Pat. No. 6 299 962 granted to Davis et al. and the like both of these patents being assigned to Reebok International Ltd. In addition generally similar to the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6 024 712 granted to Iglesias et al. the upper can include a textile material that is overmolded with a thermoplastic material. All of the patents and patent applications recited in this paragraph are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

As shown in the textile material can be impregnated or overmolded with a plastic material forming a stability element e.g. a relatively rigid thermoplastic material such as nylon polyester or polyethylene or alternatively an elastomeric thermoplastic material such as those made by Advanced Elastomer Systems that are recited elsewhere herein a foam thermoplastic material a rubber material or a polyurethane material. The textile material can be impregnated or overmolded while positioned in a substantially planar two dimensional orientation as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 299 962 granted to Davis et al. or alternately while positioned in a relatively complex three dimensional shape on a footwear last mold or the like. For example stability element shown in can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper .

Alternately a foam material can be applied to the upper as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5 785 909 granted to Chang et al. and also U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 500 granted to Tawney et al. and the like both patents being assigned to Nike Inc. these recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. The textile material can possibly be impregnated or overmolded with the use of a spray dipping or roller application generally similar to that known in the screenprinting prior art. If the plastic material is of the thermoplastic variety it can then be caused to cool and take a set.

Alternately a thermoset material which is used to impregnate or overmold the textile material can be caused to cross link by conventional means known in the prior art. As taught in the applicant s U.S. Ser. No. 09 570 171 filed May 11 2000 light cure materials which can be caused to set and cure upon exposure to a specific range of light frequency and wavelength having adequate power can also be used. When the inferior side of the upper includes a plurality of openings for accommodating the passage of a plurality of traction members associated with the anterior outsole element therethrough it can be advantageous that the inferior side of the upper in the forefoot area and possibly also that the midfoot area and rearfoot area be impregnated or overmolded by plastic material or other suitable material. Alternately the inferior side of the upper can be otherwise reinforced in order to enhance its structural integrity.

As shown in the upper can be made in general accordance with the so called Huarache style commercialized by Nike Inc. The textile material can have resilient and elastic qualities or alternatively a rubber neoprene foam rubber polyurethane or other material can be used in those areas of the vamp and quarters in which the location of a textile material is indicated. In this regard the textile material or alternately a substitute material having substantial elastic characteristics can extend into the collar area in order to create a so called fit sleeve and facilitate entry and exit of a wearer s foot. Accordingly the upper can in some footwear embodiments solely constitute the required and sufficient closure means for retaining a wearer s foot therein. Further the upper can include removable quarters including openings and eyestays for accommodating laces straps or other conventional closure means.

The upper can also be made of new thermoplastic materials which have not yet been used to make articles of footwear that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. For example textile materials made from polylactic acid polymers derived from corn or other vegetation known by the tradename NATUREWORKS fibers are presently under development and being commercialized by Cargill Dow Polymers LLC of Minneapolis Minn. in cooperation with the Kanebo Corporation which is associated with the Itochu Corporation of Osaka Japan. The physical and mechanical properties of fibers and thermoplastic materials derived from polylactic acid generally compare favorably with many existing fibers and thermoplastic materials but unlike the vast majority of the synthetic fibers and thermoplastic materials presently being used in the manufacture of articles of footwear those derived from polylactic acid are capable of substantially biodegrading when buried in the soil over a period of two to three years. Moreover other biodegradable and environmentally friendly plastic materials and fibers can also be suitable for use.

As shown in the anterior outsole element and posterior outsole element can include a backing portion. The outsole can be firmly secured in function relation to the upper and spring element with the use of at least one fastener . In an alternate embodiment it is possible to configure the posterior outsole portion such that a portion can slip over and trap the posterior side of the inferior spring element and the posterior outsole element can then be secured with at least one fastener near the anterior side of the posterior outsole element and inferior spring element . Since the posterior outsole element consists of a resilient elastomer such as natural or synthetic rubber during footstrike and the early portion of the braking phase of the gait cycle the posterior outsole element can become somewhat elongated and distended along the longitudinal or anterior to posterior axis and to lesser degree the medial to lateral or transverse axis and this can further contribute to reducing the shock and vibration generated upon impact as the forces and direction of loading during footstrike and the braking phase have not only vertical or z axis but also x and y axis components.

The ground engaging portion of the outsole can be made of a natural or synthetic rubber material such as nitrile or styrene butadiene rubber a thermoplastic material an elastomer such as polyurethane a hybrid thermoplastic rubber and the like. Further these materials can possibly be suitable for use when blown or foamed. Suitable hybrid thermoplastic and rubber combinations include dynamically vulcanized alloys which can be injection molded such as those produced by Advanced Elastomer Systems 338 Main Street Akron Ohio 44311 e.g. SANTOPRENE VYRAM GEOLAST TREFSIN VISTAFLEX GEOLAST DYTROL XL and taught in the following patents e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 783 631 U.S. Pat. No. 5 779 968 U.S. Pat. No. 5 777 033 U.S. Pat. No. 5 777 029 U.S. Pat. No. 5 750 625 U.S. Pat. No. 5 672 660 U.S. Pat. No. 5 609 962 U.S. Pat. No. 5 591 798 U.S. Pat. No. 5 589 544 U.S. U.S. Pat. No. 5 574 105 U.S. Pat. No. 5 523 350 U.S. Pat. No. 5 403 892 U.S. Pat. No. 5 397 839 U.S. Pat. No. 5 397 832 U.S. Pat. No. 5 349 005 U.S. Pat. No. 5 300 573 U.S. Pat. No. 5 290 886 U.S. Pat. No. 5 177 147 U.S. Pat. No. 5 157 081 U.S. Pat. No. 5 100 947 U.S. Pat. No. 5 086 121 U.S. Pat. No. 5 081 179 U.S. Pat. No. 5 073 597 U.S. Pat. No. 5 070 111 U.S. Pat. No. 5 051 478 U.S. Pat. No. 5 051 477 U.S. Pat. No. 5 028 662 and U.S. RE 035398. SANTOPRENE is known to consist of a combination of butyl rubber and ethylene propylene. KRATON thermoplastic elastomers made by the Shell Oil Corporation DYNAFLEX thermoplastic elastomers and VERSAFLEX thermoplastic elastomer alloys distributed by GLS Corporation of McHenry Ill. can also be suitable for use. Further the material compositions taught in both U.S. Pat. No. 6 342 544 B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 367 167 granted to Krstic et al. and assigned to Nike Inc. can also be suitable for use and these patents are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The backing portion of the outsole can be made of a formulation of a thermoplastic material such as nylon polyurethane or SANTOPRENE that is relatively firm relative to the ground engaging portion of the outsole . For example a polyurethane or SANTOPRENE material having a hardness between 35 75 Durometer Asker C could be used on the ground engaging portion of the outsole whereas a polyurethane or SANTOPRENE material having a hardness between 75 100 Durometer

on the Shore A or D scales could be used to make the backing of outsole . A polyurethane backing can be bonded to a polyurethane ground engaging portion of outsole or other material or alternately a SANTOPRENE backing can be bonded to a SANTOPRENE ground engaging portion of outsole . This can be accomplished by dual injection molding or over molding of the like materials.

One advantage when using homogenous materials for the two portions of the outsole concerns the affinity of like materials for effectively bonding together. Another advantage in using homogenous materials for the two portions of the outsole concerns the green or environmentally friendly and recyclable nature of the component at the end of its service life. It is possible for the spent homogenous outsole component including the backing and ground engaging portion to be recycled by the footwear manufacturer or by a third party e.g. the outsole can be re ground into pieces and be thermoformed to make a portion of a new outsole component. Further the relative absence of adhesives in the manufacture of the outsole components and article of footwear taught in the present invention also makes for a green or environmentally friendly product. In contrast conventional articles of footwear are commonly manufactured with the extensive use of adhesives for bonding a foam midsole to an upper and outsole. These adhesives are commonly non environmentally friendly and can pose health hazards and the resulting article of footwear cannot be so easily disassembled or recycled at the end of its service life. Moreover the process associated with making conventional foam materials in making a midsole and the blowing agents used therein can be non environmentally friendly and relatively energy inefficient as compared with conventional injection molding of thermoplastic materials or the use of light cure materials and methods as taught in the applicant s U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08 862 598 entitled Method of Making a Light Cure Component For Articles of Footwear hereby incorporated by reference herein. For example instead of using large presses imparting both heat and pressure upon compression molds for effecting the cure of a midsole or outsole component over perhaps a seven minute cycle time injection molding equipment and light cure technology can be used to reduce the cycle times to perhaps fractions of a second with relative energy efficiency and little or no waste product in a relatively environmentally friendly manufacturing environment. Accordingly manufacturing can be located in the United States or otherwise closer to the intended market.

It is also possible for heterogeneous materials to be used in making the backing and ground engaging portion of the outsole . For example Advanced Elastomer Systems has developed a formulation of SANTOPRENE which is capable of bonding to nylon. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 709 954 U.S. Pat. No. 5 786 057 U.S. Pat. No. 5 843 268 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 906 872 granted to Lyden et al. and assigned to Nike Inc. which relate to chemical bonding of rubber to plastic materials in articles of footwear all of these patents hereby incorporated by reference herein. Further in an alternate embodiment of the present invention the backing can simultaneously comprise at least a portion of the spring element of the article of footwear as shown in . In addition the outsole can also include desired lines of flexion . The following patents and some of the prior art recited therein contain teachings with respect to lines of flexion in articles of footwear such as grooves and the like U.S. Pat. No. 5 384 973 U.S. Pat. No. 5 425 184 U.S. Pat. No. 5 625 964 U.S. Pat. No. 5 709 954 U.S. Pat. No. 5 786 057 U.S. Pat. No. 4 562 651 U.S. Pat. No. 4 837 949 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 024 007 all of these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The use of a relatively soft elastomeric material having good dampening characteristics on the ground engaging portion of an outsole can contribute to enhanced attenuation of the shock and vibration generated by impact events. Relatively soft elastomeric materials having good dampening characteristics tend to have inferior abrasion and wear characteristics and this can pose a practical limitation on their use in conventional articles of footwear constructed with the use of adhesives having non renewable outsoles. However the use of relatively soft elastomeric materials having good dampening characteristics does not pose a practical problem with respect to the preferred article of footwear taught in the present application since the outsole can be easily renewed and replaced. Accordingly the preferred article of footwear can provide a wearer with enhanced cushioning effects relative to many conventional articles of footwear.

The spring element can be made of a resilient material such as metal and in particular spring steel or titanium. Titanium is widely used in the aerospace and automotive industries in part due to its excellent strength to weight ratio and durability. Titanium materials are available in three general categories depending upon their alloy content alpha that is a material having a close packed hexagonal atomic arrangement alpha beta and beta that is a material having a body centered cubic atomic arrangement The preferred titanium alloys for use in a spring element are those which can be characterized either as alpha beta or beta. Examples of suitable alpha beta or beta titanium alloys include 15 3 and 6 4 which can be obtained from TIMET Titanium Metals Corporation of 403 Ryder Avenue Vallejo Calif. 94590 and also from President Titanium of Hanson Mass. 02341.

The spring element can alternately be made of a thermoplastic material or alternately a preferred fiber composite material. Glass fiber aramid or KEVLAR fiber boron fiber or carbon fiber composite materials can be used individually or in partial or complete combination. Glass fiber composite materials are generally available at a cost of about 5.00 per pound whereas carbon fiber materials are generally available at a cost of about 8.00 14.00 per pound. Glass fiber composite materials generally exhibit a lower modulus of elasticity or flexural modulus thus less stiffness in bending as compared with carbon fiber materials but can generally withstand more severe bending without breaking. However the higher modulus of elasticity of carbon fiber composite materials can provide greater stiffness in bending a higher spring rate and reduced weight relative to glass fiber composite materials exhibiting like flexural modulus. Blends or combinations of glass fiber and carbon fiber materials are commonly known as hybrid composite materials.

Carbon fiber composite materials can be impregnated or coated with thermoplastic materials or thermoset materials. The modulus of elasticity or flexural modulus of some finished thermoplastic carbon fiber composite materials can be lower than that of some thermoset carbon fiber composite materials. For example a sample of thermoplastic carbon fiber composite material having a relatively broad weave can have a flexural modulus in the range between 10 12 Msi and in the range between 5 6 Msi in a finished part whereas a standard modulus grade of thermoset impregnated uni directional carbon fiber composite material can have a flexural modulus in the range of 33 Msi and in the range between 18 20 Msi in a finished part. Also available are intermediate modulus carbon fiber composite materials at approximately 40 Msi and high modulus carbon fiber composite materials having a flexural modulus greater than 50 Msi and possibly as high as approximately 100 Msi. Accordingly in order the achieve a desired flexural modulus or stiffness value a thicker and heavier part made of a thermoplastic carbon fiber composite material can be required that is relative to a thermoset impregnated uni directional carbon fiber composite material.

Impregnated carbon fiber composite materials are commonly known as prepreg materials. Such materials are available in roll and sheet form and in various grades sizes types of fibers and fiber configurations but also with various resin components. Various known fiber configurations include so called woven plain basket twill satin uni directional multi directional and hybrids. Prepreg carbon fiber composite materials are available having various flexural modulus and generally the higher is the modulus then the more expensive is the material. A standard modulus uni directional prepreg peel ply toughened carbon fiber composite material such as C2000 33550 150 GSM having a 35 percent resin content or alternately quick cure 2510 made by Zoltek Materials Group Inc. of San Diego Calif. 97121 can be suitable for use. This prepreg material can have a thickness of 0.025 mm or 0.01 inches including the peel ply backing and in the range between 0.13 0.15 mm or 0.005 inches without. It is therefore relatively easy to predict the number of layers required in order to made a part having a known target thickness but one should also allow for a nearly 10 percent reduction in thickness of the part due to shrinkage during the curing process. The cost in bulk of a suitable unidirectional 33 Msi thermoset standard modulus carbon fiber composite material having a weight of approximately 150 300 grams per square meter made and distributed by Zoltek Materials Group Inc. is presently approximately in the range between 8.00 and 9.00 per pound and one pound yields approximately one square meter of material.

The required thickness of a spring element and any possible sub components can vary considerably depending upon e.g. the materials being used the construction and processing methods being used the overall design and configuration of a particular part the fastener s possibly being used the intended activity or particular application and also the weight biomechanical technique and characteristic running speed or velocity of an individual wearer. Nevertheless the following information can serve as a broad guideline both when making and selecting a spring element and any possible sub components for use in an article of footwear. The superior spring element can have a thickness approximately in the range between 0.5 10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include an anterior spring element having a thickness approximately in the range between 0.5 2.5 mm and in particular in the range between 1.0 1.75 mm. It can be advantageous that the anterior spring element maintain a thickness that is not much less than 1 mm in order to well distribute point loads enhance robustness of the part and to provide a noticeable performance enhancement. The superior spring element or posterior spring element can have a thickness in the rearfoot area approximately in the range between 1 10 mm but when formed in a three dimensional cupped shape including a heel counter can have a lesser thickness in the range between 1 5 mm. The inferior spring element can have a thickness approximately in the range between 3 10 mm.

The following more specific guidelines relate to an article of footwear including a spring element having relatively short lever arms which can provide approximately 10 mm of deflection generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing . The required thickness of the superior spring element or anterior spring element in the forefoot area of an article of footwear intended for use in running when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni directional prepreg carbon fiber composite material is then normally approximately in the range between 1.0 1.25 mm for an individual weighing 100 140 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds approximately in the range between 1.25 1.50 mm for an individual weighing 140 180 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds and in the range between 1.5 1.75 mm for an individual weighing 180 220 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds. When running at higher speeds e.g. on a track and field surface individuals generally prefer a thicker and stiffer plate relative to that selected for use at slow or moderate speeds. The perceived improvement in running economy can be on the order of at least one second over four hundred meters which corresponds to approximately two to three percent improvement in aerobic ability. The superior spring element or anterior spring element can store energy when loaded during the latter portion of the stance phase and early portion of the propulsive phase of the running cycle and then release that energy during the latter portion of the propulsive phase. A spring element can provide not only deflection for attenuating shock and vibration associated with impact events but can also provide a relatively high level of mechanical efficiency by possibly storing and returning in excess of 70 percent of the energy imparted thereto. Accordingly the spring to dampening ratio of the material of which the spring element is made can be expressed as being equal to or greater than 70 30 percent. In fact a preferred unidirectional carbon fiber composite material or spring titanium material can return in excess of 90 percent of the energy imparted thereto during the materials test associated with test method ASTM 790. In contrast most conventional prior art athletic footwear soles including foam midsoles and rubber outsoles have a spring to dampening ratio somewhere between 40 and 60 percent. The preferred article of footwear can then afford a wearer with greater mechanical efficiency and running economy than most conventional prior art athletic footwear.

Further unlike the conventional foam materials used in prior art articles of footwear such as ethylene vinyl acetate which can become compacted and take a compression set the spring elements used in the present invention are not substantially subject to compression set degradation due to repetitive loading. The degradation of conventional foam materials can cause injury to a wearer as when a broken down midsole results in a wearer s foot being unnaturally placed in a supinated or pronated position as opposed to a more neutral position or when a compacted foam midsole in the forefoot area causes a wearer s metatarsals to drop out of normal orientation or to unnaturally converge. Further the quality of cushioning provided by conventional foam materials such as ethylene vinyl acetate or polyurethane rapidly degrades as the material becomes compacted and takes a compression set. In contrast the spring elements taught in the present invention do not substantially suffer from these forms of degradation rather provide substantially the same performance and geometric integrity after extended use as when new. Given an article of footwear including removable and replaceable components in the event of a fatigue or catastrophic failure of a spring element the damaged part can simply be removed and replaced.

Again given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing the required thickness of a superior spring element or posterior spring element for the rearfoot area of an article of footwear intended for running use when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni directional prepreg carbon fiber composite material is approximately in the range between 2.0 5.0 mm and in particular is approximately in the range between 2.75 3.25 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 100 140 pounds approximately in the range between 3.25 3.75 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 140 180 pounds and approximately in the range between 3.75 4.25 for an individual weighing between 180 220 pounds. It can be advantageous for the sake of robustness that the thickness of the inferior spring element be at least equal to or greater than that of the corresponding superior spring element or posterior spring element in the rearfoot area as the inferior spring element has a more complex curved shape and is subject to direct repetitive impact events. Accordingly given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing the required thickness of the inferior spring element when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni directional prepreg carbon fiber material is approximately in the range between 2.0 5.0 mm and in particular is approximately in the range between 2.75 3.25 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 100 140 pounds approximately in the range between 3.25 3.75 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 140 180 pounds and approximately in the range between 3.75 4.25 for an individual weighing between 180 220 pounds.

Different individuals can have different preferences with respect to the thickness and stiffness of various spring element components regardless of their body weight and this can be due to their having different running styles or different habitual average running speeds. During normal walking activity the magnitude of the loads generated are commonly in the range between one to two body weights whereas during normal running activity the magnitude of the loads generated are commonly in the range between two to three body weights. Accordingly the flexural modulus of a spring element for use in an article of footwear primarily intended for walking can be reduced relative to an article of footwear intended for running thus the thickness and or stiffness of the spring element can be reduced. During a lateral movement and jumping sport such as basketball the loads generated can be much higher and in the range between 2.5 and 10 body weights. Accordingly greater stiffness and or thickness can be required of a spring element and any sub component parts. As result it can sometimes be advantageous to introduce an additional cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a fluid filled bladder and or a foam material between a superior spring element or posterior spring element and an inferior spring element and also between a superior spring element or anterior spring element . and an anterior spring element ..

When making spring elements using carbon fiber composite material it is important to recognize that relatively slight variations in the configuration or design can have both substantial and subtle effects upon the exhibited stiffness service life and overall performance of the component. For example consider the long bow versus the recurve bow configuration used in archery. These two shapes provide different stiffness characteristics when the bow is being drawn and also when the arrow is released. For example when the inferior spring element is made in a sharper curved shape it can exhibit greater stiffness and a different stress strain curve that is relative to when it is made in a more gentle curved configuration.

Again given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing the following constitutes an approximate guideline regarding the required thickness and stiffness of a superior spring element or anterior spring element made of standard modulus 33 Msi unidirectional carbon fiber composite material for use in the forefoot area of a running shoe given a wearer s body weight and common perception. Again much depends on an individual s body weight running technique speed and the intended application. For example an individual having a given body weight who happened to be a heavy heel striker would likely select an anterior spring element having the next highest stiffness value. Likewise an individual who habitually runs at a faster pace than another individual having a similar body weight and running technique might also select an anterior spring element having the next highest stiffness value. Nevertheless Table 1 shown below can provide guidance to runners making selections regarding a suitable spring element .

Again regarding the rearfoot area of the superior spring element or posterior spring element the thickness of the part can vary considerably depending upon whether a relatively flat configuration or alternately a cupped shape anatomical configuration which possibly includes a curved midfoot area including longitudinal and transverse arch support medial and lateral side stabilizers or a heel counter is incorporated therein. Given a three dimensional cupped or anatomical shaped posterior spring element including a heel counter and an individual weighing between 100 200 pounds the minimum thickness required to achieve the desired robustness is believed to be approximately in the range between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. However when a fastener is used to affix the inferior spring element to the superior spring element or posterior spring element even with the presence of a large washer or flange a fastener can still impart a relatively large point load thus a minimum thickness of 2.5 mm in the area near the position of the fastener can be required in order to ensure robustness.

Regardless the upwardly extending portions of a posterior spring element forming a heel counter and also the anterior edge of the part can generally be made to have a thickness in the range between 0.5 2.0 mm. It is believed to be advantageous for the purposes of commercialization to over engineer the part with respect to load tolerance and robustness and to make the inferior side of the posterior portion of a superior spring element or a posterior spring element in not more than three or four different thickness e.g. approximately 2.0 mm for the range between 100 140 pounds body weight approximately 2.5 mm for the range between 140 180 pounds body weight and approximately 3.0 mm for the range between 180 220 pounds body weight.

It can be helpful to provide guidance regarding the stiffness characteristics associated with various portions of a spring element e.g. S soft M medium and H hard VH very hard UH ultra hard or to otherwise identify suitable performance criteria by specific event player position and the like. One way of expressing the relationship between superior spring elements or posterior spring elements having a three dimension cupped shape including a heel counter which are made in one of three different thickness in the rearfoot area and the possible use of five different alternate thickness in the forefoot area of the superior spring element or an anterior spring element in a running shoe suitable for use in track and field is shown in Table 2 below.

Regarding the amount of deflection in the rearfoot area associated with the superior spring element or posterior spring element if and when the superior spring element or posterior spring element is made in a three dimensional cupped shape possibly including a heel counter then not much deflection will take place e.g. normally something in the range between 0 2.0 mm. It is important to recognize that if the superior spring element or posterior spring element is made in a three dimensional cupped shape including a heel counter that only permits something in the range between 0 2.0 mm of deflection then this can place a larger load and requirement for deflection upon the inferior spring element . Accordingly all things being equal the inferior spring element could then have to be made thicker and or stiffer. Nevertheless if and when the superior spring element or posterior spring element is substantially flat and planar and the inferior spring element is curved but both parts have about the same thickness then the inferior spring element will generally still exhibit the most deflection. However the superior spring element or posterior spring element will also account for a portion of the total deflection. In the abstract if the parts are engineered so as to permit 10 mm of total deflection then the inferior spring will normally account for at least half and perhaps nearer to three quarters of the deflection before the two parts would meet and bottom out the mechanical system. Here a great deal depends upon the design and manufacture of the parts the application and the wearer s body weight and technique.

Given a running shoe used in a typical linear running motion even 4 6 mm of deflection of the superior spring element or posterior spring element in the rearfoot area will not pose a biomechanical or stability problem provided that the article of footwear is designed properly. It should be noted that the fat pad on the human heel is known to commonly deflect approximately in the range between 8 10 mm and also the longitudinal arches of many individuals are known to commonly deflect in the range between 2 6 mm. Moreover in existing conventional articles of footwear including foam midsoles equal to or greater than 4 6 mm of deflection commonly takes place on both the top and bottom sides of the sole during a rearfoot impact event.

A question can be raised concerning the possibility of 4 6 mm of deflection taking place at the lateral rear corner that is deflection having a torsional component. If a line 80 mm in length is drawn representing the width of the bottom net of the outsole of a typical running shoe sole in the rearfoot area and then a line 6 mm high is drawn perpendicular to and intersecting the line having a length of 80 mm at the end on the lateral side the resulting angle as measured from the opposite side of the line having a length of 80 mm is only approximately five degrees. This does not degrade stability since the feet of most individuals are normally supinated approximately 7 8 degrees upon footstrike when running barefoot on grass and substantial rotative movements commonly take place between the rearfoot and forefoot areas of an individual s foot during running activity. Further the average runner commonly pronates approximately 7 8 degrees when running barefoot on grass but double that magnitude of pronation can be associated with running in conventional prior art articles of footwear including foam midsoles. However both the rate and magnitude of pronation can often be reduced by using an article of footwear made according to the present invention that is relative to a conventional prior art article of footwear. Moreover it can possibly be advantageous to engineer an article of footwear including a spring element intended for running so as to approximate the magnitude of supination upon footstrike and also the subsequent magnitude and rate of pronation commonly observed when individuals run barefoot on natural grass. Nevertheless it can be readily understood that the design and engineering of an article of footwear including a spring element can have different requirements for other sport applications which include lateral and random movements.

Again the required thickness of the inferior spring element will depend in part upon whether the superior spring element or posterior spring element is contributing to deflection and by how much the design and composition of the inferior spring element but also a wearer s body weight biomechanical technique and speed. For example given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in which provides approximately 10 mm of total deflection and a generally planar superior spring element or posterior spring element making a contribution to deflection of less than or equal to 5 mm and an individual running at slow to moderate speeds the approximate required thickness of an inferior spring element made of standard modulus 33 Msi carbon fiber composite material having a curved configuration and a diagonal flexural axis is shown in Table 3 provided below.

If and when the superior spring element or posterior spring element has a three dimensional shape including a heel counter and therefore makes little or no contribution to deflection that is deflection in the range between 0 2.0 mm then the inferior spring element will generally need to be approximately at least 0.25 0.5 mm thicker in order to effectively manage the loading associated with greater deflection so as to not exceed approximately 60 66 percent of the inferior spring element s maximum engineered loading capacity. This percentage represents an approximate threshold regarding the capability of carbon fiber composite materials to withstand cycling loading for hundreds of thousands or millions of cycles.

It is important to note that as the flexural axis is rotated from the transverse axis orientated at 90 degrees to the longitudinal axis and towards a 45 degree angle the effective length of the flexural axis and stiffness of the inferior spring element can be increased. Further when the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element are being fabricated it can be advantageous to position some of the layers of the carbon fiber material both consistent with and perpendicular to the orientation of the flexural axis since this area can function as a fulcrum point and be associated with high local loading.

The length of the effective lever arms and of the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element on the medial and lateral sides will also influence the stiffness of the larger spring element . Accordingly it can be readily understood that scalar effects can be present with respect to widely varying sizes of articles of footwear. Again given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in providing approximately 10 mm of deflection and made of standard modulus 33 Msi carbon fiber composite material the approximate required thickness of an inferior spring element as a function of the body weight of a runner and also the type of superior spring element or posterior spring element being used is shown in Table 3 below.

When the superior spring element consists of a single part the thickness can vary and be tapered from the posterior side to the anterior side that is the part can gradually become thinner moving in the direction of the anterior side . This can be accomplished by reducing the number of layers during the building of the part and or with the use of compressive force during the molding or curing process. When the superior spring element consists of two parts e.g. an anterior spring element and a posterior spring element the parts can be made in different thickness. Alternately the posterior spring element can be made of a higher modulus material having a given thickness and the anterior spring element can be made of a lower modulus material having the same thickness thus the two parts can possibly have the same thickness but nevertheless provide different and desired spring and dampening characteristics.

Alternately the number of fiber composite layers the type of fiber and resin composition of the layers the inclusion of a core material and the geometry and orientation of the layers can be varied so as to create areas of differential stiffness in a spring element . For example the inferior spring element can project from the superior spring element with the flexural axis orientated consistent with a transverse axis that is at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis provided that the aforementioned variables concerning the fiber composite layers are suitably engineered so as to render the medial side of the inferior spring element approximately 2 3 times stiffer than the lateral side that is in an article of footwear intended for walking or running activity.

Further the configuration of a spring element and in particular an inferior spring element having an flexural axis orientated at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis can be configured so as to provide differential stiffness. For example a portion of a spring element can include transverse or longitudinal slits notches openings a core material or reduced thickness so as to exhibit areas of differential stiffness as shown in . Several configurations and methods for achieving differential stiffness in the midfoot area or rearfoot area of an article of footwear are recited in U.S. Pat. No. 5 875 567 this patent being hereby incorporated by reference herein. However the relatively sharp portion of the spring element that is shown projecting beyond the medial side of the sole in U.S. Pat. No. 5 875 567 could possibly result in injury to the medial side of a wearer s opposite leg during running. Further given the common orientation of the foot of a wearer who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker during footstrike an inferior spring element having an flexural axis orientated consistent with transverse axis that is at 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis is generally not so advantageously disposed to receive repetitive loading and exhibit robustness during its service life relative to an inferior spring element having an flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 10 and 50 degrees as shown in . In this regard the foot of a wearer characterized as a rearfoot striker is normally somewhat dorsiflexed supinated and abducted during footstrike as recited and shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5 425 184 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 625 964 these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein. Accordingly given an average individual having normal biomechanics who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker it can be advantageous for the flexural axis of the inferior spring element to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20 30 degrees in footwear intended for walking or running. However the flexural axis of an inferior spring element can be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 30 50 degrees in footwear intended for use by individuals who tend to more substantially pronate during the braking and stance phases of the gait cycle. Other teachings having possible merit relating to differential stiffness in the rearfoot area of an article of footwear include e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 506 462 U.S. Pat. No. 4 364 189 U.S. Pat. No. 5 201 125 U.S. Pat. No. 5 197 206 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 197 207 all of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.

In order to make carbon fiber composite spring elements it can be advantageous to create a form or mold. The form or mold can be made of wood composite material metal and the like. For example prototype forms or molds can be made of thin sheets of stainless steel which can be cut and bent into the desired configurations. The stainless steel can then be treated with a cleaner and appropriate release agent. For example the stainless steel can be washed with WATERCLEAN and then dried then given two coats of SEALPROOF sealer and dried and finally given two coats of WATERSHIELD release agent and dried all of these products being made by Zyvax Inc. of Boca Raton Fla. and distributed by Technology Marketing Inc. of Vancouver Wash. and Salt Lake City Utah. A prepreg uni directional carbon fiber composite material including a peel off protective layer that exposes a self adhesive surface can then be cut to the approximate shapes of the desired spring element by a razor blade scissors cutting die water jet cutter or automatic cutting machine. Suitable carbon fiber composite materials for use include F3 C 50K made by FORTAFIL AS4C made by HEXCEL T300 made by TORAY AMOCO and in particular ZMG 2000 Z346 150 35 24 which is a 150 GSM material including a toughened epoxy with a 35 percent resin content made by Zoltek Materials Group Inc. and the like. The individual layers of carbon fiber composite material can have a thickness in the range between approximately 0.13 0.15 mm or 0.005 inches and be affixed to one another to build the desired thickness of the spring elements but allowing for a reduction of approximately 10 percent due to shrinkage which commonly takes place during the curing process. The individual layers can be alternated in various orientations e.g. some can be orientated parallel to the length of the desired spring element and others inclined at 45 degrees to the left or right or at 90 degrees. The result can be a quasi isotropic fiber composite material that is one having a relatively homogenous flexural modulus in all directions. However the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the spring element in various orientations can be specifically engineered by varying the number type and orientation of the fiber composite layers.

Once the spring element components have been built by adhering the desired number type and orientation of glass or carbon fiber composite layers together the spring element can be rolled or placed under pressure and applied to the stainless steel prototype form or mold. When making prototype spring elements the carbon fiber composite lay up including the stainless steel form or mold can be wrapped in a peel ply or perforated release film such as Vac Pak E 3760 or A 5000 Teflon FEP then wrapped in a bleeder such as A 3000 Resin Bleeder Breather or RC 3000 10A polyester which will absorb excess resin which could leach from the spring elements during curing. This assembly can then be enclosed in a vacuum bagging film e.g. a Vak Pak Co Extruded Nylon Bagging Film such as Vac Pak HS 800 and all mating edges can be sealed with the use of a sealant tape such as Schnee Morehead vacuum bag tacky tape or RAP RS200. A vacuum valve can be installed in functional relation to the vacuum bagging film before the vacuum bag is completely sealed. The vacuum valve can be subsequently connected to an autoclave vacuum hose and a vacuum pump and the assembly can be checked for leaks before placing it in an oven for curing. The entire assembly while under constant vacuum pressure can then be placed into an oven and heated at a temperature of approximately 250 degrees Fahrenheit for one to two hours in order to effect setting and curing of the carbon fiber composite spring elements. Upon removal from the oven and cooling the vacuum bag can be opened and the cured carbon fiber composite spring elements can be removed from within the bleeder and the peel ply or release film and separated from the stainless steel form or mold. The spring element parts can then possibly be cut or trimmed with a saw a grinding wheel a sander a CNC machine or with the use of water jet cutting equipment. The fasteners can then be affixed and the spring element installed in functional relation to the upper and outsole of a prototype article of footwear.

The method of making fiber composite materials in a production setting differs depending upon whether thermoplastic or thermoset materials are being used. For example thermoplastic carbon fiber composite materials including their resin coatings are commonly available in flat sheet stock. Parts can then be cut from these sheets using water jet cutting equipment. These parts can then be preheated for a short time in an oven in order to reach a temperature below but yet relatively close to the melt point of the thermoplastic material thus rendering the part moldable. Production compression molds are commonly milled from aluminum then polished and treated with a non stick coating and release agent. The cost of a single aluminum production compression mold is approximately 2 500. The heated thermoplastic carbon fiber composite parts can then be placed into a relatively cold compression mold and subjected to pressure as the part is simultaneously caused to set and cool. The parts can then be removed and inspected for possible use. One manufacturer of thermoset fiber composite parts is Performance Materials Corporation of 1150 Calle Suerte Camarillo Calif. 93012.

The production method and process is different when a thermoset carbon fiber composite uni directional prepreg material is being used to make a desired part. The uncured layered thermoset part can be placed into an aluminum compression mold which has been preheated to a desired temperature. The mold is closed and the part is then subjected to both heat and pressure. In this regard the set and cure time of thermoset fiber composite materials is temperature dependent. Generally the set and cure time for thermoset parts will be about one hour given a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit. However it is often possible for the same thermoset parts to reach their gel state and take a set whereupon the shape of the part will be stable in about one half hour given a temperature of 270 degrees Fahrenheit in about fifteen minutes given a temperature of 290 degrees Fahrenheit or in about seven minutes given a temperature of 310 degrees Fahrenheit. Having once reached their gel state and taken a set the thermoset parts can then be removed from the mold. The parts can later be placed in an oven and subjected to one to two hours of exposure to a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit in order to complete the curing process. Moreover Zoltek Materials Group Inc. of San Diego Calif. makes a quick cure thermoset material identified by their product code number 2510 which can completely cure in ten minutes given a mold temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit and perhaps even faster at higher temperatures.

An alternate method of making thermoset carbon fiber composite spring element components involves making and using a single sided mold having sufficient width to encompass at least one part along the x axis but the mold can then extend along the y axis for many feet or vice versa. For example the mold can be made of 7075 grade aluminum which can be purchased from Metals USA Specialty Metals Northwest Inc. at 3400 S.W. Bond Avenue in Portland Oreg. The mold can have a have a width of 16 inches a length of 30 inches and maximum thickness of 1 inches and be machined to provide a desired configuration using CNC equipment. Accordingly a relatively long lay up of carbon fiber material can be placed upon the mold vacuum bagged and then cured in an autoclave. For example ZMG 2000 Z346 150 35 24 which is a 150 GSM prepreg carbon fiber material including a toughened epoxy with a 35 percent resin content made by Zoltek Materials Group Inc. can be used. A thicker material such as 300 GSM prepreg carbon fiber material can be used alone or alternately in combination with a 150 GSM material in order to more rapidly build up the thickness of the desired part. A large number of individual components can then be cut from the resulting cured sheet of carbon fiber material. For example approximately seven full length superior spring element parts can be obtained from a sheet of carbon fiber composite material formed upon mold having the size recited above. Alternately approximately fourteen inferior spring elements can be obtained from a sheet of carbon fiber composite material formed upon a mold having the size recited above. The individual parts can be cut with a saber saw a CNC machine using a vacuum fixture for holding the cured sheet of carbon fiber composite material or with a multi dimensional water jet cutter. A provider of water jet cutting services is Hegar Manufacturing of 15600 S.E. FOR MOR Clackamas Oreg. A superior spring element or anterior spring element having a planar configuration or alternately a curved shape can be made by this method. Moreover an inferior spring element having more dramatic curved shape can be made by this method.

An alternate method of making carbon fiber composite parts involves using an injection mold. An uncured carbon fiber material which may or may not already be impregnated with a resin can be placed into an injection mold and resin can then be injected under pressure and subsequently cured to form a finished part. Alternately a resin containing short or long glass carbon or boron fibers can be injected into a mold and caused to set. The compression and injection mold methods of making fiber composite parts can be advantageous for use when attempting to make components having multiple complex curved shapes. Manufacturers of thermoset fiber composite parts include All Composites of 3206 232nd Street East Spanayay Wash. 98387 and Quatro Composites of 12544 Kirkham Court Number 16 Poway Calif. 92064.

Alternative methods of making fiber composite parts can include the use of light cure technology other forms of compression or injection molding reaction injection molding and also pulltrusion. Compression molding injection molding and reaction injection molding have been widely used in the automotive industry e.g. the body of the Corvette largely consists of fiber composite construction. Thermoplastic materials or alternately thermoset materials including polymers resins or epoxies which are rubber toughened that further include glass fiber aramid fiber carbon fiber or boron fiber materials and the like can possibly be used. For example Dow Chemical Company of Midland Mich. makes SPECTRUM reaction moldable polymer which has been used to make automobile body parts and LNP Engineering Plastics of Exton Pa. makes THERMOCOMP and VERTON thermoplastic materials which can include long carbon fibers. Further PPG of Pittsburgh Pa. Corning of Corning N.Y. and Vetrotex of Valley Forge Pa. are makers of electrical and structural grade fiberglass products.

The spring element can consist of a plurality of portions and preferably three portions an anterior spring element a posterior spring element and an inferior spring element which can be affixed together in functional relation e.g. with the use of at least one mechanical fastener and the like. The anterior spring element can underlay a substantial portion of the forefoot area and is preferably affixed to the posterior spring element in the forefoot area or midfoot area posterior of a position in the range between approximately 60 70 percent of the length of the upper of the article of footwear as measured from the posterior side that is a position posterior of the metatarsal phalangeal joints of a wearer s foot when the article of footwear is donned. The metatarsal phalangeal joints are normally located near approximately 70 percent of foot length on the medial side of the foot and nearer to approximately 60 percent of foot length on the lateral side of the foot. Accordingly the anterior spring element can underlay the metatarsal phalangeal joints of the foot and energy can temporarily be stored and later released to generate propulsive force when the anterior spring element undergoes bending during the stance and propulsive phases of the running cycle. The anterior spring element can be selectively and removably attached and renewed in the event of damage or failure. Further a wearer can select from anterior spring elements having different configurations and stiffness and therefore customize the desired stiffness of the anterior spring element in an article of footwear . For example different individuals having different body weight running styles or characteristic running speeds could desire anterior spring elements having different stiffness.

Likewise the superior spring element or posterior spring element can be selectively and removably affixed to the inferior spring element in the rearfoot area or midfoot area of the article of footwear . Accordingly the superior spring element or posterior spring element can underlay a substantial portion of the wearer s rearfoot and perhaps a portion of the wearer s midfoot and energy can be stored during the braking and early stance phases of the running cycle and released during the later portion of the stance and propulsive phases of the running cycle to provide propulsive force. The anteriormost portion of wearer s rearfoot on the lateral side of the foot is consistent with the junction between the calcaneus and cuboid bones of the foot which is generally in the range between 25 35 percent of a given foot length and that of a corresponding size upper of an article of footwear . The superior spring element or posterior spring element and inferior spring element can be selectively and removably attached and renewed in the event of failure. Further a wearer can select from superior spring elements or posterior spring elements and inferior spring elements having different configurations and stiffness and therefore customize the desired stiffness of these spring elements in an article of footwear . For example different individuals having different weight running styles or characteristic running speeds could desire to select superior spring elements or posterior spring elements and inferior spring elements having different stiffness.

Accordingly the spring element of a preferred article of footwear can consist of three portions an anterior spring element which is positioned anterior of at least approximately 70 percent of the length of the upper of the article of footwear as measured from the posterior side a posterior spring element which extends anteriorly from proximate the posterior side of the upper of the article of footwear and is affixed in functional relation to the anterior spring element and an inferior spring element which is affixed in functional relation to the posterior spring element . The inferior spring element projects rearwards and downwards and can extend beneath a substantial portion of the rearfoot area of the article of footwear . Alternately the spring element can be formed in two portions or a single part.

In the embodiment shown in the elevation of the wearer s foot in the rearfoot area measured under the weight bearing center of a wearer s heel is approximately 26 mm and the elevation of the wearer s foot in the forefoot area measured under the ball of the foot proximate the metatarsal phalangeal joints is approximately 16 mm in a size 9 men s article of footwear. The difference in elevation between the forefoot area measured under the ball of the foot and the rearfoot area measured under the weight bearing center of a wearer s heel in a men s size 9 article of footwear is commonly in the range between 10 12 mm and is approximately 10 mm in the embodiment shown in .

For some footwear applications such as competition in track and field or road racing the maximum amount of deflection that might be desired by some individuals between the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element could be in the range between 8 15 mm. As shown in the maximum amount of deflection possible as between posterior spring element and inferior spring element is approximately 10 mm. However greater amounts of deflection in the range between 15 50 mm can be desired for use by some individuals in various footwear applications as shown and discussed herein with respect to other embodiments of the present invention. Nevertheless it can be advantageous from the standpoint of injury prevention that the elevation of the rearfoot area minus the maximum amount of deflection permitted between the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element be equal to or greater than the elevation of the forefoot area . It can also be advantageous as concerns the longevity of the working life of the spring element that the amount of deflection permitted be equal to or less than approximately 75 percent the maximum distance between the proximate opposing sides of the spring element that is as between the inferior surface of the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the superior surface of the inferior spring element .

The amount of deflection or compression provided under the wearer s foot in the forefoot area by the embodiment shown in is commonly approximately in the range between 4 6 mm and such can be provided by an insole having a thickness of 3.75 mm in combination with an anterior outsole element having a total thickness of 6.5 mm including a backing having a thickness of approximately 1.5 mm and a tread or ground engaging portion having a thickness of approximately 5 mm and in particular when the ground engaging portion is made of a relatively soft and resilient material having good traction and shock and vibration dampening characteristics. For example a foamed natural or synthetic rubber or other elastomeric material can be suitable for use. If hypothetically an outsole material having advantageous traction and shock and vibration dampening characteristics only lasts 200 miles during use that is as opposed to perhaps 300 miles associated with a harder and longer wearing outsole material this does not pose a practical problem as the outsole portions can be easily renewed in the present invention whereas a conventional article of footwear would normally be discarded. Accordingly it is possible to obtain better traction and shock and vibration dampening characteristics in the present invention as the durability of the outsole portions is not such an important criteria.

It can be readily understood that posterior of the flexural axis the length of the superior lever arm and inferior lever arm formed along the medial side of the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element are shorter than the length of the corresponding superior lever arm . and inferior lever arm . formed along the lateral side of the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element . Accordingly when the inferior spring element is affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element or posterior spring element and is subject to compressive loading the inferior spring element exhibits less stiffness in compression at the lateral and posterior corner and increasing stiffness in compression both anteriorly and laterally. Again it can be advantageous for enhancing rearfoot stability during walking or running that the spring element including inferior spring element exhibit approximately two to three times the stiffness in compression on the medial side relative to the stiffness exhibited on the lateral side . Further as shown in the inferior aspect of the spring element has a concave configuration in the midfoot area that is between the inferiormost portion of the anterior spring element in the forefoot area and the inferiormost portion of the inferior spring element in the rearfoot area . It can be readily understood that the configuration of this concavity and the flexural modulus of the spring element as well as the stiffness of the anterior outsole element middle outsole element posterior outsole element anterior spacer and posterior spacer can be engineered to provide optimal cushioning characteristics such as deflection with respect to the midfoot area and rearfoot area for an individual wearer or for a target population having similar needs and requirements.

As shown in an anterior spacer which can possibly consist of a cushioning medium or cushioning means having desired spring and dampening characteristics can be inserted in the area between the anterior spring element and posterior spring element that is within an area of possible overlap as between the two components. The configuration and compressive flexural and torsional stiffness of an anterior spacer can be used to modify the overall configuration and performance of a spring element and article of footwear . In this regard an anterior spacer can have uniform height or alternately an anterior spacer can have varied height. Further an anterior spacer can exhibit uniform compressive flexural and torsional stiffness throughout or alternately an anterior spacer can exhibit different compressive flexural and torsional stiffness in different locations. These varied characteristics of an anterior spacer can be used to enhance the cushioning stability and overall performance of an article of footwear for a unique individual wearer or for a target population of wearers. For example an anterior spacer having an inclined or wedge shape can be used to decrease the rate and magnitude of pronation supination and inward or outward rotation of portions of a wearer s foot during portions of the walking or running gait cycle and can also possibly correct for anatomical conditions such as varus or valgus. The relevant methods and techniques for making corrections of this kind are relatively well known to qualified medical doctors podiatrists and physical therapists. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4 399 620 U.S. Pat. No. 4 578 882 U.S. Pat. No. 4 620 376 U.S. Pat. No. 4 642 911 U.S. Pat. No. 4 949 476 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 921 004 all of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Normally an anterior spacer having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the lateral to the medial side or one which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the medial side can be used to compensate for a forefoot varus condition whereas an anterior spacer having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the medial to the lateral side or one which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the lateral side can be used to compensate for a forefoot valgus condition. An individual with a profound anatomical condition such as varus or valgus or having a history of injury would be prudent to consult with a trained medical doctor when contemplating modification to their articles of footwear. Further an anterior spacer can also have a wedge or complex curved shape along the longitudinal axis that is in the posterior to anterior orientation and various configurations of an anterior spacer can be provided which can be used to modify the amount of toe spring and the overall conformance of a spring element and article of footwear as desired.

It can be readily understood that in this specification and the associated drawing figures the orientation and location of the longitudinal axis is determined by longitudinally bisecting the rearfoot area of the article of footwear and likewise any related components that are present in the rearfoot area such as the inferior spring element and also the posterior portion of the superior spring element or posterior spring element . It is recognized that a longitudinal axis drawn in this manner will not bisect the forefoot area of an article of footwear having a substantially curve lasted configuration. The orientation of the transverse axis can be determined by drawing a line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis as defined above that is the transverse axis intersects the longitudinal axis at a 90 degree angle. Accordingly when an article of footwear or component such as an inferior spring element is recited as including or having a longitudinal axis or transverse axis it can be readily understood that this refers to the aforementioned defined coordinate system for describing e.g. the orientation relationship or various specific features of the sub components which are part of an article of footwear made according to the present invention.

The possible use of notches or openings in order to diminish the stiffness in bending or flexural modulus exhibited by a portion of spring element and two substantially transverse lines of flexion is also shown in . Shown with a dashed line in and also in medial side view in is the possible inclusion of a rocker configuration in the forefoot area of the sole an article of footwear . It can be advantageous for the point of greatest elevation of the rocker to be located approximately in the range between 1 4 cm posterior of the metatarsal phalangeal joints. The location of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint on the medial side of an average wearer s foot is normally at slightly less than seventy percent of foot length and the location of the fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint on the lateral side is normally somewhat greater than sixty percent of foot length as measured from the posterior side of the wearer s foot. Accordingly a rocker can be positioned in the range between 1 4 cm behind a generally transverse and slightly diagonal line that can be drawn as between these two approximate positions for any given size article of footwear.

Further in contrast with the configuration of inferior spring element shown in an alternate inferior spring element . is shown in . The alternate inferior spring element . descends from proximate the superior spring element or posterior spring element and attains maximum separation therefrom. The inferior spring element . can then possibly extend posteriorly in a parallel relationship with respect to the overlaying superior spring element . However the inferior spring element . then curves upwards as the inferior spring element . extends towards the posterior side of the article of footwear . It can sometimes be advantageous that the inferior spring element . be tapered in the range between approximately 1 15 degrees or otherwise be curved upwards as it extends towards the posterior side and lateral side corner of the sole of the article of footwear .

In the article of footwear shown in when a line is drawn parallel to the ground support surface and tangent to the inferior surface of the superior spring element in the forefoot area the approximate slope of the superior spring element as it extends posteriorly is approximately five degrees. When affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element or posterior spring element the inferior spring element projects downwards and rearwards therefrom before attaining the desired amount of separation between the components which at least partially determines the maximum amount of deflection that the resulting spring element can provide. As shown in and several other drawing figures once the inferior spring element descends and attains the desired amount of separation the inferior spring element extends posteriorly in a substantially parallel relationship with respect to the corresponding overlaying portion of the superior spring element or posterior spring element . Accordingly after descending from proximate the superior spring element or posterior spring element and establishing the desired amount of separation the inferior spring element does not curve upwards as it extends towards the posterior side of the article of footwear . Instead it is known in prior art articles of footwear and can also be advantageous in the present invention for a portion of the outsole near the posterior side and in particular proximate the posterior side and lateral side corner to be tapered in the range between 1 15 degrees or otherwise curved upwards. However the overall configuration of the article of footwear including the amount of toe spring and the aforementioned slope of the superior spring element can influence or determine the amount of slope or curvature that is advantageous to incorporate in this portion of the outsole .

It can be readily understood that a posterior spacer can serve a purpose analogous to that of anterior spacer and vice versa. Accordingly a posterior spacer can consist of a cushioning medium or cushioning means having desired spring and dampening characteristics. The posterior spacer can be inserted between the inferior spring element and posterior spring element that is within an area of possible overlap as between the two components. The configuration and stiffness of a posterior spacer can be used to modify the overall configuration and performance of a spring element and article of footwear . In this regard a posterior spacer can have uniform height or alternately a posterior spacer can have varied height. Further a posterior spacer can exhibit uniform compressive flexural or torsional stiffness throughout or alternately can exhibit different properties in different locations. These varied characteristics of a posterior spacer can be used to enhance the cushioning and or stability of an article of footwear for an unique individual wearer or for a target population of wearers.

For example a posterior spacer having an inclined or wedge shape can be used to decrease the rate and magnitude of pronation supination inward or outward rotation of portions of a wearer s foot during phases of the walking or running gait cycle and can also possibly correct for anatomical conditions such as varus or valgus. Again the relevant methods and techniques for making corrections of this kind are relatively well known to qualified medical doctors podiatrists and physical therapists. Normally a posterior spacer having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the lateral to the medial side or a posterior spacer which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the medial side can be used to reduce the magnitude and rate of rearfoot pronation whereas a posterior spacer having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the medial to the lateral side or a posterior spacer which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the lateral side can be used to reduce the magnitude and rate of rearfoot supination. An individual having a profound anatomical condition such as varus or valgus an individual who dramatically pronates or supinates or an individual who has a history of injury would be prudent to consult with a trained medical doctor when contemplating modification to their articles of footwear.

It can be readily understood that with the use of an anterior spacer positioned between anterior spring element and posterior spring element and a posterior spacer positioned between the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element that the configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot area midfoot area and rearfoot area of an article of footwear can be adjusted and customized as desired by an individual wearer. Further the use of an anterior spacer and or posterior spacer having a select configuration can be used to adjust the amount of support provided by a superior spring element or posterior spring element which can possibly further include contours for mating with the complex curved shapes of a wearer s foot. For example it is possible to customize the amount of support that is provided to the medial longitudinal lateral longitudinal and transverse arches and to the sides of a wearer s foot.

Generally the efficiency of a vibration decay time modifier will be enhanced the closer it is positioned in functional relation to a negative nodal point. When properly configured and placed proximate the negative nodal point of an object or implement relatively little mass is required in order to substantially prevent or alternately to attenuate resonant vibration within fractions of a second. A negative nodal point is a point at which a substantial portion of the vibration energy in an excited object or implement will pass when it is excited by energy associated with an impact or other vibration producing event. Discussion of modes of vibration and negative nodal points can be found in Arthur H. Benade 2nd edition New York Dover Publications 1990 Harry F. Olson 2nd edition New York Dover Publications 1967 and U.S. Pat. No. 3 941 380 granted to Francois Rene Lacoste on Mar. 2 1976 this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein.

A technology taught by Steven C. Sims in U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 046 granted Nov. 4 1994 this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein has been commercialized by Wilson Sporting Goods Inc. into the SLEDGEHAMMER INTUNE tennis rackets and by Hillerich and Bradsby Company Inc. in the LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SIMS STINGSTOP aluminum baseball and softball bats as well as the POWERBUILT 

SIMS SHOCK RELIEF golf club line and LIMBSAVER product for archery. These products substantially eliminate the vibration and stinging associated with impact events experienced by a wielder s hands. Certain aspects of the aforementioned teachings can be applied in the present invention in order to accomplish a similar results with regards to an article of footwear and the lower extremities of a wearer.

The source of shock and vibration can derive from a relatively controlled and harmonic movement such as when a wearer repeatedly impacts the pavement while running in an article of footwear . Further the source of shock and vibration can be random in nature as when a wearer rides a wheeled vehicle such as a bicycle or motorcycle over rough terrain. Alternately the source of shock and vibration can be constant and mechanically driven as when a wearer rides a bicycle or a motor vehicle such as a motorcycle or snowmobile. A shock wave that is a shock pulse or discontinuity can travel at the speed of sound in a given medium. In the human body the speed of sound in bone is approximately 3 200 meters second and in soft tissue approximately 1 600 meters second. A shock wave traveling in a relatively dense fluid medium such as water has approximately five times the power that it does in a less dense fluid medium such as air. It is important to recognize that the human body is largely comprised of water and like fluid medium.

When a metal bell is struck the bell will resonate and continue to ring for an extended time while the vibration energy is gradually dampened out. When a small bell is rung one can place one s hand upon it and silence it. In that case the primary dampening means for attenuating the resulting shock and vibration is the anatomy of the human subject. The same thing can happen when an impact event takes place as between an individual s foot and the materials which are used in an athletic shoe and a running surface. When an individual runs on an asphalt surface in running shoes the sound of the impact event that one hears is the audible portion of the shock wave that has been generated as result of the impact.

Many individuals know from experience that a vibrating implement or object can numb the hands. This is even more true when the source of the vibration is continuous and driven as when power equipment is being used. Associated with that numbness can be pain reduced sensation and proprioception and reduced muscular effort and performance as the body responds to protect itself from a perceived source of trauma and injury. Chronic exposure to high levels of vibration can result in a medical condition known as white finger disease. Generally the lower extremities of most individuals are not subject to high levels of driven vibration. However bicycle riders wearing relatively rigid articles of footwear can experience constant driven vibration thus their feet can become numb or go to sleep over time. Motorcycle riders can also experience the same phenomenon.

The preferred article of footwear includes spring and dampening means for at least partially attenuating shock and vibration that is the initial shock pulse pressure wave or discontinuity and associated peak g s that are imparted to a wearer due to an impact event. At a cellular or molecular level such vibration energy is believed to disturb normal functions such as blood flow in tendon tissue. Given appropriate engineering with respect to the characteristic or desired spring stiffness mass deflection frequency dampening and percent transmissibility an article of footwear of the present invention can partially attenuate shock and vibration. Viscous friction and mechanical dampening means can be used to attain this end. It is known that the mean power frequency associated with the rearfoot impact event in running generally corresponds to 20 Herz and that of the forefoot to 5 Herz. The design and configuration as well as the spring and dampening characteristics of a spring element posterior spacer and vibration decay time modifier can be engineered so as to target these frequencies and provide a specific characteristic tuned mechanical response.

An anterior spacer posterior spacer and vibration decay time modifier can be made of a cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a natural or synthetic rubber material or a resilient elastomer such as polyurethane. In this regard thermoset or thermoplastic materials can be used. Thermoplastic materials can be less expensive to produce as they can be readily injection molded. In contrast thermoset materials are often compression molded using a relatively time and energy consuming vulcanization process. However some thermoset materials can possess superior dampening properties and durability. Dampening materials which can be cured with the use of ultrasonic energy microwave visible or ultraviolet light radio frequency or other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used. Room temperature cure elastomers such as moisture or evaporation cure or catalytic cure resilient materials can also be used. A suitable dampening material can be made of a butyl chloroprene polynorborene neoprene or silicone rubber and the like. Alternately a dampening material can be made of an elastomeric material such as polyurethane or SORBOTHANE . Suitable hybrid thermoplastic and rubber combinations can also be used including dynamically vulcanized alloys which can be injection molded such as those produced by Advanced Elastomer Systems 338 Main Street Akron Ohio 44311 e.g. SANTOPRENE VYRAM GEOLAST and TREFSIN . SANTOPRENE is known to consist of a combination of butyl rubber and ethylene propylene. Generally other materials developed for use in the audio industry for dampening vibration such as EAR ISODAMP SINATRA EYDEX and the like or combinations thereof can be used. Fillers such as organic or inorganic microspheres carbon black or other conventional fillers can be used. Plasticizing agents such as fluids or oils can be used to modify the physical and mechanical properties of the dampening material in a desired manner. The preferred dampening material has transition characteristics suitable for the expected operational temperature of an article of footwear and other physical and mechanical properties well suited to dampen shock and vibration and reduce vibration decay time.

It can be advantageous that the dampening material used to make a solitary vibration decay time modifier including a stem and a head have a hardness in the range of 10 30 durometer and preferably approximately 20 durometer on the Shore A scale. A relatively soft dampening material is capable a dampening a wide range of exciting vibration frequencies and also relatively low vibration frequencies. However a harder dampening material having greater shear and tear strength can sometimes be advantageous for use when making an anterior spacer or posterior spacer due to the magnitude of the loads which can be placed upon these components during use. A vibration decay time modifier can be affixed to spring element by conventional means such as adhesive mechanically mating parts chemical bonding heat and pressure welding radio frequency welding compression molding injection molding photocuring and the like.

In a conventional article of footwear having a foam midsole and rubber outsole the materials located between the wearer s foot and the inferior ground engaging surface of the outsole normally become compressed during footstrike and subsequent loading of the sole. During compressive loading the stiffness of these materials increases linearly or geometrically and as result the ability of the sole to dampen shock and vibration rapidly diminishes. Further the area of the sole which transmits most of the shock and vibration can be relatively small and localized. In this regard the energy associated with a shock pulse or discontinuity passes tends to pass quickly by the shortest route and through the hardest or stiffest material in which it is in communication. Again the transmission of shock and vibration is extremely fast in the human body and the materials used in conventional articles of footwear. In a conventional article of footwear the shock and vibration resulting from impact with the support surface is rapidly transmitted through the outsole midsole upper and insole and into a wearer s foot.

However in the present invention the shock and vibration generated proximate the inferior ground engaging surface of the outsole must travel anteriorly along the outsole and inferior spring element before being transmitted to the superior spring element upper and wearer thus for a greater distance relative to a conventional article of footwear. This affords more time and space in which to attenuate and dampen shock and vibration. Further in the present invention the outsole can be made of a softer material having better shock and vibration dampening characteristics than is normally the case in a conventional article of footwear. In addition a posterior spacer can serve as a shock and vibration isolator between the inferior spring element and the superior spring element upper and wearer s foot. Moreover as shown in at least one vibration decay time modifier can be positioned in direct communication with inferior spring element in order to dampen shock and vibration before it can be transmitted to a wearer. Accordingly the present invention can provide a wearer with enhanced cushioning shock and vibration isolation and dampening effects relative to conventional footwear constructions.

Also shown in is flexural axis and with the use of a dashed line an alternate position of flexural axis . with reference to the longitudinal axis . It can be readily understood that other more anterior or more posterior positions of a flexural axis with reference to the longitudinal axis are possible. The position of the flexural axis can be selected in order to influence or determine the physical and mechanical properties of a spring element and the overall conformance and performance of an article of footwear as desired. Generally it can be advantageous that the posteriormost portion of the flexural axis on the medial side be located in the range between 1 6 inches from the posterior side of the upper and in particular in the range between 2 4 inches from the posterior side of the upper. However in the footwear embodiment shown in it can be advantageous both with respect to the stability of the preferred article of footwear but also the weight and cost of the spring element that the posteriormost position of the flexural axis on the medial side be located approximately in the range between 1 3.5 inches from the posterior side of the upper in a men s size 9 article of footwear . The method of grading and scaling various footwear components for other men s or women s sizes is well known in the footwear industry thus the preferred range as concerns the position of the flexural axis on the medial side can be determined from this information for any given size article of footwear .

It can be readily understood that this teaching concerning the angular orientation of the flexural axis with reference to the longitudinal axis can be applied to other embodiments of a preferred article of footwear . Possible angular deviation of the flexural axis from the transverse axis in the range between 10 50 degrees was previously discussed. One advantage to using a flexural axis that is deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 10 50 degrees is that it permits the use of an inferior spring element having a relatively homogenous construction and a substantially uniform thickness and this both serves to reduce manufacturing costs and enhances product reliability. It can be readily understood that various combinations and permutations with respect to the position of the flexural axis with reference to the longitudinal axis and the angular deviation of the flexural axis from the transverse axis can be functional.

Again an anterior spacer or posterior spacer can also have a wedge or complex curved shape along the longitudinal axis that is in the posterior to anterior orientation and various configurations can be provided which can be used to modify the overall conformance of a spring element and article of footwear as desired. Accordingly many variables can be manipulated and selected to optimize the configuration and performance of an article of footwear for an individual or for a given target population having similar characteristics and requirements.

The superior spring element can have the approximate configuration of the bottom net of a corresponding last or other hard template model or pattern. Alternately the superior spring element can be made in accordance with a soft model created and maintained in a data storage and retrieval computer environment. A superior spring element can possibly simultaneously consist and serve as a lasting board and vice versa. However not every structure and material composition of a lasting board would be such as to possibly create or serve as a spring element . A lasting board can be made of wood cellulose cardboard or other natural fiber reconstituted leather a textile formed by knitting or weaving a non woven textile a textile formed by stitch bonding metal such as steel spring steel aluminum or titanium a thermoplastic material such as nylon polyester polypropylene an elastomer such as polyurethane thermoplastic rubber or other natural or synthetic rubber or alternately as preferred and previously discussed in detail a fiber composite material such as carbon fiber.

The sole can include separate midsole and outsole components or can be made as a single component. Various sole components can be made having different physical and mechanical characteristics and performance capabilities for possible selection and use by a wearer. The sole can be selectively removed and replaced by a wearer in order to customize the article of footwear or to renew a component as desired. As shown in the spring element does not include an inferior spring element rather the spring element consists of a superior spring element or an anterior spring element and posterior spring element which are affixed in functional relation.

It can be readily understood that within certain practical limitations different lasting boards having different configurations possibly including different lengths foot shapes and widths can be used with a given upper in order to customize the fit of an article of footwear for a unique individual or target population. For example a plurality of lasting boards can be developed for use with different target populations consisting of individuals having generally similar anatomical characteristics and foot dimensions. Further it can also be readily understood that within certain practical limitations different uppers having different configurations possibly including different lengths widths and foot shapes can be used with a given lasting board in order to customize the fit of an article of footwear for a unique individual or target population. For example a plurality of uppers can be developed for use with different target populations consisting of individuals having generally similar anatomical characteristics and foot dimensions.

Accordingly the raw data or feedback provided by an individual when transformed into information and intelligence could possibly indicate the selection a lasting board having American length size 11 last or foot shape number 3 from amongst a possible selection of thirty different last or foot shape configurations and also indicate selection of the following code with respect to utilization of the various different positions and alternate openings Code 1.1 2.2 3.2 4.2 5.2 6.1 7.2 8.2. In contrast an different individual could require the same lasting board having American length size 11 last or foot shape number 3 but a different code for optimal utilization of the various different positions and alternate openings e.g. Code 1.2 2.1 3.1 4.2 5.3 6.1 7.2 8.2. Obviously a different individual could require a lasting board having a different length and also a different last or foot shape and the data and preferences of different individuals can also indicate or result in the selection of different uppers having different functions designs styles materials and sizes.

A lasting board or spring element component having a given size length can also sometimes be used with articles of footwear which are in the range between one to three different half sizes longer and shorter. As shown in at least one alternate set of openings can be included on the posterior spring element for affixing the posterior spring element in functional relation to the anterior spring element . Further an alternate set of openings can be included on the anterior spring element for the same purpose. In the American sizing system length changes of one full size approximately correspond to increments of rd of an inch and the distances associated with other sizing systems are also known. Accordingly two sets of alternate openings spaced apart by a distance corresponding to a full size length can sometimes render a lasting board or spring element suitable for use with three or four sizes.

The present invention teaches and makes possible not only a novel method of manufacturing articles of footwear but also a novel way of doing both retail and Internet business. The configuration and dimensions of a given wearer s foot and any other special needs and requirements or wearer preferences can be recorded by direct observation and measurement in a retail or medical setting or by a wearer or other individual at their home or other remote site and this data can be used to generate information and intelligence relating to the manufacture of an appropriate custom article of footwear for the wearer and intended end use. This information and intelligence relating to an individual wearer or target population can include a so called soft virtual model that is created and maintained in computer software or other data storage and retrieval system for present and future use.

Conventional measuring or reproduction means including but not limited to rulers measuring tapes Brannock devices two or three dimensional scanners pressure sensors infrared thermography stereolithography paper photographs photocopies cameras images tracings video verbal communication telephone television FAX computers and computer screens software data storage and retrieval systems e mail lasts lasting boards templates molds models and patterns can be used as well as other tangible mediums of expression and the like. Some of the data which might be collected could include but not be limited to an individual s foot length foot width at one or more locations foot girth at one or more locations arch characteristics such as high arch normal arch or low arch the presence of a varus or valgus condition bunions Morton s toe two dimensional foot shape three dimensional foot shape data collected using F scan equipment and software made by Tekscan Inc. of Boston Mass. strike index plantar pressure and center of pressure data collected using Pedar or Emed equipment made by Novel Electronics Inc. of St. Paul Minn. digital photographs or video images showing superior inferior anterior medial lateral and perspective views of an individual s foot video data collected of an individual while in motion using digital cameras biomechanical analysis of an individual s motion such as rearfoot motion analysis and possibly including top bottom side frontal rear and perspective view using equipment and software made by manufacturers such as Mikromak GmbH of Erlangen Germany Northern Digital of Waterloo Ontario Canada Motion Analysis of Santa Rosa Calif. VICON Motion Systems of Lake Forest Calif. or Peak Performance Technologies Inc. of Englewood Colo. and the individuals name mailing and e mail address password phone number sex weight age training age walking or running pace fit preference such as loose normal or tight activity preference affiliation sizing system preference such as inches or metric place of payment such as zip code or city method of payment such as cash check debit card credit card and including the relevant account number and expiration date.

Given this collected raw data information and intelligence can then be created including an individual record which could include a virtual model of an individual s feet. This information and intelligence can be used to select one or more options with respect to a footwear last or other footwear configuration including length size width and girth measurements. Accordingly this information and intelligence can be used to identify specific categories and footwear models for consideration. If and when working in a computer environment the various options can be displayed for consideration and selection. This can be done with the use of a wireless computer or cell phone. Further an individual can then click on various categories or models in order to receive additional technical information and also pricing information. In addition an individual can then click on various segments or components of a virtual model or article of footwear being presented and so access more specific menus relating to selections which can be made according to their preference with respect to the structure function material color and design of a given component. Accordingly an individual can make a final and confirmed selection.

Given the collected data the information and intelligence created and a ready and adequate stock of the various components anticipated for use in making articles of footwear an individual customer or alternately a worker in a retail medical manufacturing or distribution center which possibly includes an automated system including robotics can gather the required components for assembly. An individual can then purchase the required components and assemble the article of footwear themselves. Alternately the article of footwear can be manufactured or assembled by a worker in a retail medical manufacturing or distribution center. In any case a custom article of footwear can be manufactured and assembled within thirty minutes and in some cases even in less than one minute.

For example selections can be made from a ready stock of different uppers lasting boards spring elements and related sub component parts insoles and sole components possibly including midsoles and outsoles having different configurations and dimensions corresponding to a selected article of footwear and the resulting custom article of footwear can be rapidly made or assembled as desired. If desired a substantial portion of an article of footwear that is greater than fifty percent and preferably greater than seventy five percent and most preferably substantially all of the other major components of the article of footwear can be removably assembled and secured in functional relation to the upper to make a custom article of footwear within minutes. Again this task can be performed by the customer or a service provider at the point of purchase in a retail setting or medical facility. Accordingly similar to the rapid delivery eyewear retail stores and service centers that presently exist a customer can now also be provided with a custom article of footwear within minutes.

Within the continental United States and many other host countries in which the present invention would be practiced a customized article of footwear could be caused to be delivered by same day or overnight service as desired. Accordingly the present invention teaches a novel method of manufacturing articles of footwear and also a novel way of doing both retail and Internet business.

In brief as illustrated in the flow chart shown in the present invention teaches a method of making a custom article of footwear using a vending device. In particular the present invention teaches a method of making a custom article of footwear with the use of a vending device the article of footwear having an anterior side a posterior side a medial side a lateral side and having at least an upper a sole and cushioning means affixable together in functional relation including the steps of 

creating from the collected data information and intelligence for providing at least one footwear component for use in making the custom article of footwear 

providing a plurality of footwear components and a plurality of variations of a plurality of the footwear components a plurality of the footwear components including fastening means 

selecting from the plurality of footwear components at least one footwear component for use in making the custom article of footwear

Alternately a midsole cushioning element can also be made of a foam rubber or plastic material such as polyurethane or ethylene vinyl acetate. In addition the midsole can simultaneously comprise a posterior spacer . As shown in a midsole cushioning element can occupy substantially the entire space area and volume between the superior spring element and the inferior spring element posterior of the flexural axis . Alternately a midsole cushioning element can occupy a portion of the space area and volume between a superior spring element and inferior spring element as shown e.g. in and the like.

The presence of convex peaks and concave valleys can increase the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending and including the torsional stiffness exhibited by the inferior spring element on the medial side relative to the lateral side . As a result the rate and magnitude of rearfoot pronation experienced by a wearer of an associated article of footwear can be reduced.

While it is generally preferred or advantageous that the inferior spring element and flexural axis be positioned in the midfoot area or rearfoot area it is possible for the inferior spring element to extend into the anterior portion of the midfoot area and forefoot area as shown in and the like. is a bottom plan view of a spring element consisting of a superior spring element and an inferior spring element . Line indicates the approximate position of a wearer s metatarsal phalangeal joints relative to the superior spring element . Again on the medial side the metatarsal phalangeal joints are commonly found at slightly less than 70 percent of foot length and on the lateral side greater than 60 percent of foot length but yet somewhat less than on the medial side that is as measured from the posterior side of an article of footwear . illustrates the possibility of the flexural axis being generally consistent with line .

At higher walking or running speeds or when jumping it is known that individuals often impart higher forces on the medial side of the forefoot to greater degree than the lateral side and so there can then sometimes be a need and it can be advantageous to provide greater stiffness on the medial side of the forefoot area . Further given the biomechanical events associated with walking and running it can be advantageous to reduce the torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side of the forefoot area relative to the medial side as this can reduce the length of the effective lever arm formed by the spring element and sole of an article of footwear thereby reduce the rate and magnitude of inward rotation of the foot and so enhance stability and performance. In addition reducing the torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side of the forefoot area can increase the amount of deflection which takes place during impact and the ground support phase of the gait cycle thus enhance perceived and actual cushioning effects. Moreover the transition and work performed by the foot during the ground support phase can then be smoother and more economical but also more natural or comfortable for a wearer. It can be readily understood that this description of biomechanical events and advantageous function could apply to many of the embodiments recited in the specification and shown in the drawing figures of this patent application but for the sake of brevity the discussion contained in this paragraph will not be repeated in association with each embodiment and drawing figure.

Again The inclusion of notches can reduce the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited along the longitudinal axis and in particular in the area between both notches . Further the inclusion of notches can also reduce the torsional stiffness exhibited in the area between both notches and also as between the forefoot area and both the midfoot area and rearfoot area . The inclusion of notches can also create at least one potential or actual generally transverse line of flexion as between the medial side and the lateral side of the spring element but also at least one potential or actual generally longitudinal line of flexion as between adjacent notches located on the same side. It can be readily understood that this description of function could apply to many of the embodiments recited in the specification and shown in the drawing figures of this patent application but for the sake of brevity the discussion contained in this paragraph will not be repeated in association with each embodiment and drawing figure.

The collecting of data step shown in could be done at a retail store or other point of purchase or service location by spoken word and direct observation and measurement by a wearer possibly interacting with a retail employee or other service provider. Alternately the collecting of data could be done by spoken word or key selection over the telephone or by written word such as letter Fax e mail the use of a computer possibly including a keyboard a touch screen voice recognition capability a wireless computer a cell phone or other data storage and retrieval system or other methods of transmitting data and information such as with the use of two or three dimensional scanners or imaging devices photos video or other tangible mediums of expression. The collecting step could include collecting data relating to a customer or individual e.g. such as their name mailing address age sex telephone number e mail address identification number password desired method of payment desired method of delivery but also data relating to their weight length and width foot size arch characteristics selected athletic activity performance level and also preferences with respect to a custom article of footwear and components thereof. It can be readily understood that a customer can order and purchase a custom article of footwear for a third party e.g. a customer who is a parent may place a footwear order and make a purchase for another individual such as a family member.

The creating of information and intelligence step can include e.g. determining for an individual customer or wearer a suitable footwear length and width size a suitable footwear last or other three dimensional footwear model or shape providing a selection of footwear category types and a selection of different styles of a custom article of footwear or at least one component thereof determining and providing a finite set of combinations and permutations of a plurality of footwear components and a plurality of variations of a plurality of these components for making a custom article of footwear determining present inventory and location thereof causing new inventory to be created and determining the most efficient and cost effective location from which to distribute and deliver a custom article of footwear or at least one component thereof.

The providing a selection of a plurality of footwear components and a plurality of variations of a plurality of the components step can include providing a plurality of footwear product categories and a plurality of possible footwear models or skus and a further plurality of colors materials and footwear components relating to the plurality of footwear models or skus. Accordingly this step can include creating and providing a plurality of virtual custom articles of footwear derived from a database in a computer environment or creating and providing different actual custom articles of footwear and related components to a customer individual or wearer.

The selecting step can include selecting a plurality of sufficient footwear components for making a new custom article of footwear or alternatively changing out and replacing a footwear component or renewing at least one footwear component for re making a custom article of footwear and extending its service life.

The step of providing the information and intelligence and the sufficient footwear components to physical location at which the custom article of footwear can be made could be done at a retail store and an employee could then provide the information and intelligence to their own location or alternately to a different remote location. In this step broadly entails providing information and intelligence to a physical location at which the custom article of footwear can be made. In the information and intelligence and sufficient footwear components for making a custom article of footwear is defined as being provided to a private residence or home. Generally speaking the step of providing information and intelligence and sufficient footwear components for making a custom article of footwear can include the possibility of the information and intelligence being sent to a factory a vendor a warehouse and distribution center a retail store a medical facility a service center a sales office a mail or delivery courier service a corporate headquarters a private residence and home or otherwise to a customer or individual for which the footwear product is intended whether these locations be used in complete or partial combination.

In the step of securing a plurality of sufficient footwear components for making a custom article of footwear can include the possibility of an employee at a retail store factory warehouse and distribution center medical facility service center sales office corporate headquarters or alternately a customer or third party individual completing the assembly for making the custom article of footwear. In a retail store this step could entail a retail employee completing the assembly for making of a custom article of footwear and then delivering it directly by hand over the counter or other means to a customer or individual. When the customer or individual is making their selections and placing an order from a remote location such as their private residence this step could include the delivery of a custom article of footwear by mail courier or express mail courier service such as UPS or FEDEX within a selected number of hours or days. Alternatively the customer or individual could receive and possibly secure the sufficient footwear components thus complete the assembly for making the custom article of footwear as defined in .

The possibility of providing at least one footwear component to a customer or individual for either changing out or renewing one or more components of a custom article of footwear is defined in . One or more footwear components could be delivered to a designated address whereby the assembly for making of a custom article of footwear could be completed. The designated address could include a factory a vendor a warehouse and distribution center a retail store a medical facility a service center a sales office a corporate headquarters a mail or delivery courier service or the private residence of a customer or individual whether in complete or partial combination. In a retail store or setting the delivery of at least one footwear component could be made directly to a customer or individual by a retail employee. When the customer or individual is making their selections and placing an order from a remote location such as their private residence or home the selected footwear component s can be provided by mail courier or express mail courier service such as UPS or FEDEX within a selected number of hours or days. The customer or individual could then complete the assembly for making the custom article of footwear.

In the present application it can be readily understood that those embodiments of an article of footwear that include fluid filled bladders and in particular those including multiple fluid filled bladders or fluid filled bladders including multiple chambers e.g. as shown in and the like can alternately include valves that can serve as a motion control device can be used as taught in WO 01 70061 A2 entitled Article of Footwear With A Motion Control Device by John F. Swigart and assigned to Nike Inc. Moreover at least one fluid filled bladder that forms part of a larger dynamically controlled cushioning system can be used as taught in WO 01 78539 A2 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 430 843 B1 entitled Dynamically Controlled Cushioning System For An Article of Footwear by Daniel R. Potter and Allan M. Schrock and assigned to Nike Inc. Such an article of footwear can include at least one fluid filled bladder including a plurality of chambers a control system possibly including a CPU a pressure detector and a regulator for modulating the level of fluid communication between different fluid filled bladders or chambers. The patent applications in this paragraph have been previously incorporated by reference herein.

The anterior spring element includes a plurality of notches for influencing the longitudinal transverse and torsional stiffness and overall performance of the part. The presence location shape length depth and number of the notches can be varied to make the anterior spring element more suitable for a particular activity or a particular individual. The embodiment shown in is appropriate for use in a running shoe. The longitudinal notch . near the anterior side extends to the anteriormost transverse line of flexion . and creates two opposing fingers . and . on the medial side and lateral side respectively. Given a spring element intended for use in a men s size 9 article of footwear notches . and . on the medial side can extend a relatively short distance such as approximately 15 mm whereas notches . . and . can extend for a greater distance such as approximately 25 mm. The approximate alignment of notches . and . can create a generally transverse line of flexion . anterior of the approximate position of the metatarsal phalangeal joints indicated by line . The approximate alignment of notches . and . can create a generally transverse line of flexion . generally consistent with the approximate position of the metatarsal phalangeal joints indicated by line . The orientation of notch . can create a generally diagonal line of flexion . approximately following the anterior side of the posterior spring element . The proximity of notches . and . can create a generally longitudinal line of flexion . therebetween which can reduce both the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness of the medial side and enhance stability by reducing certain leverage effects which could impact inversion or eversion of a wearer s foot in an undesired manner. Similarly the proximity of notches . and . and . can create a generally longitudinal line of flexion . therebetween which can reduce both the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness of the lateral side and enhance stability by reducing certain leverage effects which could impact inversion or eversion of a wearer s foot in an undesired manner.

In particular on the lateral side of the forefoot area of a running shoe it can be advantageous to create an extended area characterized by reduced stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness or what can be called a forefoot strike zone somewhat analogous to the rearfoot strike zone which has been previously taught by the inventor in U.S. Pat. No. 5 425 184 U.S. Pat. No. 5 625 964 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 055 746 hereby incorporated by reference herein. Further it can be advantageous in a running shoe for the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side of the anterior spring element in the forefoot area to be less than that exhibited on the medial side and by a factor generally in the range between 10 50 percent. In this regard it is generally known by those who study biomechanics that at lower speeds as when an individual is walking or running slowly the lateral side of the human foot is used to greater degree than when running at high speeds thus the human foot can exhibit differential stiffness and utilization as between the lateral side and medial side. In brief as result of the presence location shape length depth and number of the notches shown in the anterior spring element is perceived to provide enhanced cushioning stability and performance effects without the flexural or torsional modulus characteristics of the fiber composite material causing dysfunctional leverage effects or other undesired perceived phenomenon. Other configurations are possible and anticipated e.g. notches . and . could be moved more towards the posterior side to be placed well behind line indicating the approximate location of the metatarsal phalangeal joints.

Stability element . can wrap about the anterior side within the upper and stability elements . and . can be complimented by like structures on the medial side which are suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences. Accordingly a direct mechanical link can exist between the traction members that are present on the anterior outsole element and the stability elements . . and .. The stability elements . . and . include notches . and . on the lateral side and it can be readily understood that corresponding notches that would be suitably offset to accommodate for anatomical differences would be present on the medial side . The position of notch . approximately coincides with the location of a wearer s fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint and the position of notch . is more anterior thus the stability elements . . and . do not substantially inhibit flexion of a wearer s foot about the metatarsal phalangeal joints. The notches . and . terminate at a location near a tangent point which approximates the bottom net where the backing curves to assume a substantially generally planar shape as it passes beneath the inferior side of the anterior spring element . It can be advantageous that the insole extend upwards about the medial side lateral side and anterior side to greater degree than is customary in a typical article of footwear in order to cushion and protect the wearer s foot from making substantial direct contact with the stability elements . . and . as shown in . If desired the backing and stability elements . . and . can be made of a transparent material as shown. It is anticipated that stability element could be made in various alternate configurations e.g. the stability element could possibly extends upwards and be integrated with closure means such as laces or straps.

The textile material included in the upper can also be formed by circular knitting and or three dimensional weaving or knitting methods known in the prior art related to the manufacture of socks and a suitable pattern for use can be cut therefrom. Alternately the textile material forming at least a portion of the upper can be made in the origami like patterns taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5 604 997 granted to Dieter and assigned to Nike Inc. and the like or the shoe construction taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6 237 251 granted to Litchfield et al. and assigned to Reebok International Ltd. and the like or the article of footwear taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6 299 962 granted to Davis et al. also assigned to Reebok International Ltd. and the like all of these recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.

As shown in the textile material can be impregnated or over molded with a plastic material forming a stability element e.g. a relatively rigid thermoplastic material such as nylon polyester or polyethylene or alternatively an elastomeric thermoplastic material such as those made by Advanced Elastomer Systems which have been previously recited a foam thermoplastic material a rubber material or a polyurethane material and the like. The textile material can be impregnated or over molded while positioned in a substantially planar two dimensional orientation as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 299 962 granted to Davis et al. or alternately while positioned in a relatively complex three dimensional shape on a footwear last mold or the like. For example stability element can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper .

Alternately a foam material can be applied to the upper as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5 785 909 granted to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 500 granted to Tawney et al. assigned to Nike Inc. and the like the recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. The textile material can possibly be impregnated or over molded with the use of a spray dipping or roller application generally similar to that known in the screenprinting prior art. If the plastic material is of the thermoplastic variety it can then be caused to cool to take a set. Alternately a thermoset material which is used to impregnate or over mold the textile material can be caused to cross link by conventional means known in the prior art. It is also possible to use a thermoplastic material that is moldable when heated to a relatively low temperature and a wearer can then put on the article of footwear and cause the upper to be molded to a desired shape before the thermoplastic material cools and sets. Moreover as taught in the applicant s U.S. Ser. No. 09 570 171 filed May 11 2000 light cure materials which can be caused to set and cure upon exposure to a specific range of light frequency and wavelength having adequate power can also be used. When the inferior side of the upper includes a plurality of openings for accommodating the passage of a plurality of traction members associated with the anterior outsole element therethrough it can be advantageous that the inferior side of the upper in the forefoot area and possibly also that the midfoot area and rearfoot area be impregnated or over molded by plastic material or a suitable alternate material or that the inferior side otherwise be reinforced to enhance its structural integrity.

The upper can also be made of new thermoplastic materials which have not yet been used to make articles of footwear that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. For example textile materials made from polylactic acid polymers derived from corn or other vegetation known by the trade name NATUREWORKS fibers are presently under development and being commercialized by Cargill Dow Polymers LLC of Minneapolis Minn. in corporation with the Kanebo Corporation associated with the Itochu Corporation of Osaka Japan. The physical and mechanical properties of fibers and thermoplastic materials derived from polylactic acid generally compare favorably with many existing fibers and thermoplastic materials but unlike the vast majority of the synthetic fibers and thermoplastic materials presently being used in the manufacture of articles of footwear those derived form polylactic acid are capable of substantially biodegrading when buried in the soil for a period of two to three years.

Moreover the configuration and material composition of a posterior outsole element middle outsole element and anterior outsole element can be selected from a variety of options which can be provided for optimizing performance in a specific activity task or in particular environmental conditions. For example the outsole elements can be specifically designed and engineered for use in running on roads trails racing walking or cross training. An outsole element for trail running can include a greater number of traction members having greater height relative to one best suited for running on roads whereas it can be advantageous for an outsole element intended for use in racing to be especially light weight. Further an outsole element intended for use on an artificial track surface can include a plurality of relatively small protrusions or spikes. Outsole elements which are made of non marking materials can be provided that are especially suitable for use in basketball whereas outsole elements including natural rubber and the like can be provided that are especially suitable for use in volleyball. Material compounds which are especially resistant to wear can be provided for use in tennis. Outsole elements including a plurality of cleats protrusions or traction elements can be specifically designed and engineered for use in baseball football golf and soccer respectively. As shown in an outsole element can accommodate the use of a bicycle cleat system. Outsole elements made of material compositions which are resistant to oil and other chemicals can be provided that are especially suitable for use in articles of footwear intended for work and industrial use.

As shown the fasteners can be inserted through openings in the inferior side of the upper that also register with the longitudinal and transverse flex notches associated with the anterior spring element . Accordingly a given fastener which is affixed to a portion of the inferior side of the upper can then simply be drawn inwards or outwards along the path of the corresponding longitudinal or transverse flex notch and the upper can then secured in a desired position.

bladder and posterior outsole element can be selectively removed and replaced with the use of a fastener . However in contrast with the embodiment shown in a portion of the superior side of the superior spring element extends about the posterior side of the upper forming a generally curved configuration. As shown the article of footwear can include an internal heel counter or alternately an external heel counter. Again a superior spring element can alternately consist of a posterior spring element and an anterior spring element which are formed as individual parts and affixed together in functional relation.

For example given a man of average body weight the anterior spring element can be made of 15 3 spring grade titanium having a thickness of approximately 1.6 mm the posterior spring element can be made of a carbon fiber composite material formed in an anatomical three dimension shape including an integral heel counter and the inferior spring element can be made of 15 3 spring grade titanium having a thickness approximately in the range between 3.5 4.5 mm. Accordingly substantially the entire plantar side of a wearer s foot can thereby be shielded by a layer of spring grade titanium. The insole can extend upwards in the area corresponding to a wearer s arches and encompass the rearfoot area in order to shield a wearer s foot from direct contact with the heel counter and enhance fit. As shown the posterior spring element can overlap a portion of the anterior spring element that in turn can overlap a substantial portion of the backing portion of the anterior outsole element . The generally planar web portion of the sole can be direct injection molded to the inferior side of the upper . However the web portion can include a plurality of openings for permitting the traction members associated with the anterior outsole element to pass therethrough. Alternately the fraction members and sole in forefoot area can be formed as an integral unit by direct injection molding that is in a conventional manner. When the generally planar web portion of the sole is made of a resilient and elastomeric material such as a thermoplastic or thermoset natural or synthetic rubber and the web portion also has a substantial thickness that perhaps approximates one quarter inch then it can be advantageous for overall performance to at least partially encapsulate a metal insert including an opening for accommodating a fastener in the sole during the direction injection molding process. A full hex blind threaded insert made by Atlas Engineering Inc. similar to that shown in can be used as the female part of the fastener and the male part of the fastener can consist of a bolt having a flat head including an Allen or star drive such as those made by Stayfast Products Inc. and having its threads coated with nylon to serve as a self locking mechanism.

The thickness and stiffness of the anterior spring element posterior spring element and inferior spring element can be selected from a variety and range of options in order to provide optimal performance depending upon whether an individual is walking running or possibly carrying a heavy pack. Further the ground engaging portion of the anterior outsole element and also the posterior outsole element can be selected from a variety and range of options with respect to their specific physical and mechanical properties and material composition. For example a relatively soft material providing superior cushioning characteristic could be selected for use when drilling or running on asphalt whereas a material having a wettability index of equal to or greater than 90 degrees that is hydrophobic properties could be selected for use in muddy conditions. Further a material that is hydrophilic and porous could be suitable for use in snow or slippery conditions. In brief the configuration of the traction elements and their material composition can be selected for the specific anticipated or required task terrain and weather conditions. In less than one minute the article of footwear can be completely disassembled and re assembled and any selected components then be replaced. Accordingly the present invention can provide versatility and superior performance to members of the armed forces.

As shown in the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature of the anterior curve has a radius of 2.606 inches whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side of the posterior curve is 9.0 inches and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side of the posterior portion is 5.138 inches. As shown the vertical elevation is 0.6299 inches or 16 mm and the thickness of the particular inferior spring element shown is 0.189 inches or 4.8 mm at the anterior side and tapering to only 0.1083 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side . If and when desired the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10 18 mm something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature associated with the anterior curve to also change but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight running technique or characteristic running speeds and also for use in many different activities. Given an inferior spring element having the dimensions shown in the following general guidelines regarding the desired thickness for a wearer could apply a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100 120 pounds 4.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 120 140 pounds 4.5 mm for a wearer in the range between 140 160 pounds 4.75 mm for a wearer in the range between 160 180 pounds 5.0 mm for a wearer in the range between 180 200 pounds and 5.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 200 220 pounds.

Generally regarding a men s size 9 article of footwear an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches the width in the range between 75 85 mm the vertical elevation is in the range between 10 18 mm and the thickness is in the range between 4 5.5 mm at the anterior side and in the range between approximately 2 3 mm at the posterior side . Generally an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature for use in a men s size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches an advantageous radius of curvature with respect to the superior side of the posterior curve is in the range between 7 and 11 inches and an advantageous radius of curvature regarding the inferior side of the posterior portion is in the range between 4 6 inches. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20 30 degrees.

As shown in various portions of the upper can thereby be made of different textile materials and knits. For example the vamp can be made of a four way elastic textile material . and the quarter can be made of a two way elastic textile material . whereas the tip and other select portions of the upper can be made with a relatively inelastic textile material .. The primary desired direction of stretch of the elastic textile materials . and . has been indicated with arrows. As shown the upper includes conventional lace closure means .

The upper of the article of footwear can be substantially made without the need for substantial hand stitching or other labor intensive techniques and so it can be made economically in the United States or otherwise near the intended market. Again the capability of the upper to possibly serve a range of length sizes further simplifies manufacturing supply and inventory. Further as previously discussed if desired a substantial portion of an article of footwear that is greater than fifty percent and preferably greater than seventy five percent and most preferably substantially all of the other major components of the article of footwear can be removably assembled and secured in functional relation to the upper to make a custom article of footwear within minutes. Again the upper can be substantially made of recyclable and or biodegradable materials and substantially all the other various footwear components can also be made of materials that are recyclable.

Given the teachings and substantial disclosure of the present invention in this specification and the associated drawing figures it can be readily understood that at least some of the following article of footwear component selection options can be provided to a wearer or customer e.g. via an Internet website a cell phone a remote manufacturing or distribution site a medical facility or a retail establishment. Moreover many other selection options are possible. Again the present invention teaches an article of footwear that can be rapidly assembled and customized in response to an individual s selections. The following is one example of a component selection guide for the method of making a custom article of footwear according to the present invention.

Note This can vary greatly depending upon the configuration of an inferior spring element. For example given an inferior spring element having a length in the range between 4.75 5.5 inches a maximum width in the range between 75 80 mm an anterior curve having a fitted symmetrical radius of curvature in the range between approximately 2.25 and 3.0 inches a tapered posterior portion and a posterior curve having a radius of curvature of approximately 9 inches the following general guidelines could apply 

While the above detailed description of the invention contains many specificities these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention but rather as exemplifications of several preferred embodiments thereof. It can be readily understood that the various teachings alternate embodiments methods and processes disclosed herein can be used in various combinations and permutations. For example a spring element can consist of a heel counter and inferior spring element and be provided as a single integral footwear component. Alternatively a spring element can consist of a heel counter superior spring element and inferior spring element and be provided as a single integral component. Many other variations are possible. Accordingly the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiments discussed or illustrated but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.
