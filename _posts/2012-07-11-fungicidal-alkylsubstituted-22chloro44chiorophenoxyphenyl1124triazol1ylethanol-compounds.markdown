This application is a National Stage application of International Application No. PCT EP2012 063526 filed Jul. 11 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 508 084 filed Jul. 15 2011. This application also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to European Patent Application No. 11174174.1 filed Jul. 15 2011.

The present invention relates to the use of alkyl substituted 2 2 chloro 4 4 chloro phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl ethanol compounds and the N oxides and the salts thereof for combating phytopathogenic fungi and to methods for combating phytopathogenic fungi and to seeds coated with at least one such compound. The invention also relates to novel 2 2 chloro 4 4 chloro phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl propan 2 ol derivatives processes for preparing these compounds and to compositions comprising at least one such compound.

The use of 2 2 chloro 4 4 chloro phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl ethanol and certain derivatives thereof of formula

Further the fungicidal use of compounds of the abovementioned formula wherein Ris halogenalkyl e.g. fluoromethyl or 2 2 3 3 tetrachloropropyl has been mentioned in EP 0 113 640 A2 and EP 0 470 466 A2.

In addition the fungicidal use of compounds of the abovementioned formula in which Ris halogenallyl specifically 2 3 dibromo allyl have been mentioned in DE 40 03 180 A1.

The compounds according to the present invention differ from those described in the abovemention publications inter alia by the replacement of the above mentioned methyl halogenalkyl or halogenallyl groups by the specific substituent Ras defined herein.

In many cases in particular at low application rates the fungicidal activity of the known fungicidal compounds is unsatisfactory. Based on this it was an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved activity and or a broader activity spectrum against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.

This object is achieved by the use of certain alkyl substituted 2 2 chloro 4 4 chloro phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl ethanol derivatives having good fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.

The preparation of 2 2 chloro 4 4 chloro phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl pent 4 yn 2 ol is disclosed in DE 40 03 180 A1.

The compounds according to the present invention differ from those described in the abovementioned publication by the specific definition of Rand by the proviso that formula I cannot be 2 2 chloro 4 4 chloro phenoxy phenyl 1 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl pent 4 yn 2 ol.

Therefore according to a second aspect the invention provides compounds of formula I which are represented by formula I having good fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic harmful fungi 

The term compounds I refers to compounds of formula I. Likewise this terminology applies to all sub formulae e.g. compounds I.A refers to compounds of formula I.A or compounds XI refers to compounds of formula XI etc.

The compounds I can be obtained by various routes in analogy to prior art processes known cf. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009 57 4854 4860 EP 0 275 955 A1 DE 40 03 180 A1 EP 0 113 640 A2 EP 0 126 430 A2 and by the synthesis routes shown in the following schemes and in the experimental part of this application.

In a first process for example 4 chlorophenole II is reacted in a first step with bromo derivatives III wherein Y is F or Cl preferably in the presence of a base. Thereafter the resulting compounds IV are then transformed into Grignard reagents by the reaction with transmetallation reagents such as isopropylmagnesium halides and subsequently reacted with acetyl chloride preferably under anhydrous conditions and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as CuCl AlCl LiCl and mixtures thereof to obtain acetophenones V. These compounds V can be halogenated e.g. with bromine preferably in an organic solvent such as diethyl ether methyl tert. butyl ether MTBE methanol or acetic acid. The resulting compounds VI can subsequently reacted with 1H 1 2 4 triazole preferably in the presence of a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF dimethylormamide DMF toluene and in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate sodium hydroxide or sodium hydride to obtain compounds VII. These triazole compounds VII are reacted with a Grignard reagent R M of formula VIII wherein Ris as defined above and M is MgBr MgCl Li or Na e.g. phenylalkyl MgBr or an organolithium reagent phenylalkyl Li preferably under anhydrous conditions to obtain compounds I optionally using a Lewis acid such as LaCl 2LiCl or MgBr OEt. The preparation of compounds I can be illustrated by the following scheme 

In a second process to obtain compounds I bromo derivatives III in a first step are reacted with e.g. isopropylmagnesium bromide followed by an acyl chloride agent IX wherein Ris as defined above e.g. acetyl chloride preferably under anhydrous conditions and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as CuCl AlCl LiCl and mixtures thereof to obtain compounds X.

Soc. 123 25 5962 5973 2001 . The oxidation may lead to pure mono N oxides or to a mixture of different N oxides which can be separated by conventional methods such as chromatography.

If the synthesis yields mixtures of isomers a separation is generally not necessarily required since in some cases the individual isomers can be interconverted during work up for use or during application e.g. under the action of light acids or bases . Such conversions may also take place after use e.g. in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus to be controlled.

The term cultivated plants is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development cf. http www.bio.org speeches pubs er agri products.asp . Genetically modified plants are plants which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding mutations or natural recombination. Typically one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post translational modification of protein s oligo or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.

Plants that have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering e.g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2 4 D bleacher herbicides such as hydroxylphenylpyruvate dioxygenase HPPD inhibitors or phytoene desaturase PDS inhibitors acetolactate synthase ALS inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase EPSPS inhibitors such as glyphosate glutamine synthetase GS inhibitors such as glufosinate protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase inhibitors lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase ACCase inhibitors or oxynil i.e. bromoxynil or ioxynil herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors HPPD inhibitors auxin herbicides or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e.g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61 2005 246 61 2005 258 61 2005 277 61 2005 269 61 2005 286 64 2008 326 64 2008 332 Weed Sci. 57 2009 108 Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58 2007 708 Science 316 2007 1185 and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding mutagenesis e.g. Clearfield summer rape Canola BASF SE Germany being tolerant to imidazolinones e.g. imazamox or ExpressSun sunflowers DuPont USA being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas e.g. tribenuron. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean cotton corn beets and rape tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady glyphosate tolerant Monsanto U.S.A.

In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre toxins hybrid proteins truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains see e.g. WO 02 015701 .
