title: Systems and methods for supporting regulatory requirements for the distribution of controlled and non-controlled items
abstract: Systems and methods for supporting regulatory requirements for the distribution of controlled and non-controlled items such as, for example, non-controlled prescriptions (Rx), medical devices, and controlled substances in countries such as the United States and Canada, are provided. The systems and methods incorporate a license verification module that is configured to perform license validation for a particular order placed for a controlled and/or non-controlled item. In certain embodiments, the license verification module compares order data to historically sorted data and if one or more discrepancies exist, validation is unsuccessful. The license verification module may further query a third party database for updated license information upon validation failure. The systems and methods further incorporate a suspicious order monitoring module that is configured to perform a plurality of checks on the order to identify the order as an “order of interest” that may be further investigated and deemed to be suspicious.

This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 568 229 filed Dec. 8 2011 which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.

Various embodiments of the disclosed invention generally relate to systems and methods for supporting regulatory requirements for the distribution of controlled and non controlled items such as for example non controlled prescriptions Rx medical devices and controlled substances in countries such as the United States and Canada.

In the United States distributors of controlled substances are required to be registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA . A controlled substance is generally understood to be a drug or chemical substance whose possession and use are regulated under the United States Controlled Substances Act such as for instance many prescription medications and narcotic drugs. Under federal regulations registered distributors must accurately verify customer licenses and also design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances. Suspicious orders may include non limiting examples such as orders of unusual size orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern orders of unusual frequency and the like. Failure to effectively verify licenses and to diligently minimize the occurrence of suspicious order approvals may result in fines and or loss of privilege to ship such substances.

In the past drug distributors have instituted various stand alone applications designed to verify license data and or identify suspicious orders. With regard to the latter a simple threshold based calculation is applied in many instances. For example a customer may be assigned a monthly threshold for each family of controlled substances and if the customer attempts to place an order that exceeds its monthly threshold the order is flagged as suspicious. However such approaches simply set a number value that does not typically automatically adjust over time as customer patterns evolve. Further such approaches do not consider other customers or clients of the same type who may be placing orders for controlled substances within the same family. Such systems oftentimes do not concurrently verify license status at the time of evaluating an order s suspicious nature. As a result a customer s license may not be valid or their predetermined threshold may not be as accurate or up to date as viewed across a broader sample of customers over time.

Therefore a need exists for an improved system and method for verifying license data and identifying suspicious orders for a customer in which the system and method automatically check license data and account for historical order information across a broad sampling of customers and clients.

The term database refers to a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer system such as via a relational database hierarchical database or network database. For example in one embodiment the storage media includes at least one database that stores historical information on orders received and shipped for non controlled and controlled items.

In various embodiments the web servers and application servers are configured to provide data to various source systems which may wish to access various services within the RCS network infrastructure and or to place or review orders for non controlled and controlled items such as non controlled prescriptions Rx medical devices and or controlled substances. The web servers and application servers may also in certain embodiments be configured to provide data to third party entities e.g. their associated frameworks and systems such as a compliance authority for example to gather information. For instance the web services may exchange data with the source systems and compliance authority. Thus in various embodiments the web services include the hardware operating system web server software TCP IP protocols and site content web pages images and other files . Thus for example the source systems may access data delivered by the web services and may place a request with the infrastructure . Further in various embodiments a user may access one or more web pages to review information on orders.

In the embodiment of the RCS network infrastructure shown in the web services communicate over a network such as the Internet with the source systems . The source systems may interface with the web services . Furthermore as explained in more detail below the web services may also communicate with other externals systems such as a third party compliance authority s system .

In addition in various embodiments the web services communicate over a network within the system or over an external network with a RCS user s computing device . Similar to the source systems the user s computing device e.g. a desktop computer notebook or laptop personal digital assistant PDA cell phone or other processing devices may interface with the web services using a browser residing on the user s computing device .

Further in various embodiments the application servers include applications that are used to provide functionality within the RCS network infrastructure . For instance in one embodiment the application servers are made up of one or more servers and include a regulatory and compliance system RCS application. In this particular embodiment the RCS application provides functionality to verify licenses and to identify suspicious orders placed for controlled and or non controlled items such as for example non controlled prescriptions Rx medical devices and or controlled substances. In addition these services servers and storage media may also be in electronic communication with one another within the RCS network infrastructure . For instance these services servers and storage media may be in communication over the same or different wireless or wired networks including for example a wired or wireless Personal Area Network PAN Local Area Network LAN Metropolitan Area Network MAN Wide Area Network WAN the Internet or the like. Finally while illustrates the components of the RCS network infrastructure as separate standalone entities the various embodiments of the RCS network infrastructure are not limited to this particular architecture.

In addition in one embodiment the application server includes at least one storage device such as a hard disk drive a CD drive and or an optical disk drive for storing information on various computer readable media. The storage device s and its associated computer readable media may provide nonvolatile storage. The computer readable media described above could be replaced by any other type of computer readable media such as embedded or removable multimedia memory cards MMCs secure digital SD memory cards Memory Sticks electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory hard disk or the like. Additionally each of these storage devices may be connected to the system bus by an appropriate interface.

Furthermore a number of program applications e.g. set of computer program instructions may be stored by the various storage devices and or within RAM . Such program applications may include an operating system and a RCS application . This application may control certain aspects of the operation of the application server with the assistance of the processor and operating system . Furthermore the RCS application may include one or more modules for performing specific operations associated with the application although its functionality need not be modularized. For instance in particular embodiments the RCS application includes a license verification LV module and a suspicious order monitoring SOM module . As described in greater detail below the LV module verifies inbound outbound transactions containing controlled and or non controlled items for a valid license such as for example a DEA registration DEA listed chemical registration FDA registration and state controlled substances license state license Health Canada Office of Controlled Substances license and or precursor license. The SOM module provides functionality to detect suspicious orders placed for controlled and or non controlled items.

Also located within the application server in one embodiment is a network interface for interfacing with various computing entities such as the web services database services order services and or storage media . This communication may be via the same or different wired or wireless networks or a combination of wired and wireless networks as discussed above.

The database services the order services and the web services may each include components and functionality similar to that of the application services . For example in one embodiment each of these entities may include 1 a processor that communicates with other elements via a system interface or bus 2 a display device input device 3 memory including both ROM and RAM 4 a storage device and 5 a network interface. Thus these architectures are provided for exemplary purposes only and are not limiting to the various embodiments. The terms computing device and computer device are used generically to refer to any computer computing device desktop notebook or laptop distributed system server gateway switch or other processing device adapted to perform the functions described herein.

As noted above various embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for verifying inbound outbound transactions containing controlled and or non controlled items against a valid license and for identifying suspicious orders placed for controlled and or non controlled items. Reference will now be made to and which illustrate operations and processes as produced by these various embodiments. For instance provides a process flow for a license validation according to an embodiment of the invention. provides a flow diagram of a license verification LV module that perform license validation for a particular order placed for a controlled and or non controlled item. provides a flow diagram of a suspicious order monitoring SOM module that performs checks on an order placed for a controlled and or non controlled item to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. That is in various embodiments the SOM module performs checks on the order to identify the order as an order of interest that may be further investigated and deemed to be suspicious. provide additional details regarding operation of the SOM module. The RCS application and corresponding modules are described in greater detail below.

As previously discussed in various embodiments the RCS application may include a LV module . provides a process flow for verifying license information needed for placing an order for outbound shipments or receiving inbound shipments for particular controlled and or non controlled items. In this particular instance a distributor receives an order for a controlled or non controlled item such as a non controlled prescription Rx medical device and or controlled substance. For example in one embodiment the distributor s infrastructure is in direct communication with a source system . For example the customer may send the distributor an email or the customer s system and the distributor s infrastructure may exchange information via electronic data interchange EDI over a closed network.

In another embodiment the customer may enter the order on a web site. In this particular embodiment the customer visits the web site over the Internet and enters the order via one or more web pages. That is in various embodiments web servers located within the distributor s infrastructure provide an interface e.g. one or more web pages that is configured to allow the customer to enter the order for the controlled and or non controlled item.

The customer placing the order may provide several pieces of information according to embodiments. For example the customer may provide an identifier for the controlled and or non controlled item such as a Drug Enforcement Administration DEA drug code and information identifying a license the customer has that authorizes a purchase of the controlled and or non controlled item. The customer may provide an identifier that identifies the customer such as a DEA customer identifier. Further the customer may provide the order quantity for the controlled and or non controlled item the date of placing the order and other related information such as the customer s shipping address. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision several pieces of information the customer may provide with the order in light of this disclosure.

As a result the order is received by the distributor s order services and order services begin to process the order for fulfillment. In various embodiments a component of processing the order for fulfilling is engaging the RCS application . Thus looking at order services send a compliance check to the RCS application . The compliance check may include various order information so that the RCS application can verify the license information associated with the order. Thus in this instance the RCS application invokes the LV module . In response the LV module may apply various rules for license verification. For example in particular embodiments the LV module may perform one or more checks such as checks for mandatory elements checks for valid expiration data checks for a grace period if a license has expired and or checks for name or company name state and country if a license is valid. If license verification fails one or more of the checks the RCS application sends a message back to order services indicating reason for failure. If license verification does not fail the RCS application sends a message back indicating a license for the order has been successfully validated.

In instances of failure in particular embodiments the RCS application LV module may call a compliance authority to get updated license information if available. If updated information is not available the RCS application may send an alert to file administration for the particular license. In turn the file administration updates the license information in the RCS application manually. As the license information is updated the RCS application may send an alert to customer service and customer service may send a message to order services to continue the order workflow for the order.

In various embodiments information may be updated or loaded from various sources for use by the RCS application for license verification purposes. For instance in particular embodiments the RCS application may receive bulk data uploads from the compliance authority as well as via direct requests sent from the RCS application to the compliance authority over web services . In addition in particular embodiments users may enter license information via one or more user interfaces . Further in particular embodiments order services may send the RCS application order status information on particular orders as the orders continue the order workflow.

In various embodiments information may be communicated using various mechanisms. For example in particular embodiments the RCS application may communicate with file administration and customer service with alerts or notifications. In addition in particular embodiments the file administration customer service and users may use one or more interfaces to communicate information to the RCS application and or order services . For example in one embodiment interfaces are provided as one or more webpages through the distributor s web services . Those of ordinary skill in the art can envision various other communication mechanisms that may be employed in light of this disclosure.

Turning now to this figure illustrates a flow diagram of the LV module according to an embodiment of the invention. This flow diagram may correspond to the steps carried out by the processor in the application server shown in as it executes the module in the server s RAM memory according to various embodiments.

It is noted that the LV module may be configured in various embodiments to perform the functionality for the license verification process and the associated functionality needed to support the license verification process. For instance in various embodiments the LV module may be configured to perform one or more of adding licenses retrieving licenses updating licenses searching licenses processing license verification transaction requests searching license verification transaction data getting license verification transaction data and calling vendor services.

In addition in various embodiments the license verification process involves querying license information in order to verify a license associated with a particular inbound outbound transaction request. In particular embodiments such information may be stored in one or more databases and the information may be maintained and updated from various sources. As a result the RCS application may provide a number of different mechanisms for receiving updating and maintaining license information such as application programming interfaces API and user interfaces.

Returning to in Step the LV module receives receipt order information associated with a controlled and or non controlled item such as a non controlled prescription Rx medical device or controlled substance. As previously discussed the receipt order information may have been received from a distributor s order services and may include information such as for example an identifier for the item and information identifying a license the customer has that authorizes the purchase of the item. The customer may also provide an identifier that identifies the customer and or the order quantity the date of placing the order and other related information such as the customer s shipping address.

In Step the LV module validates the receipt order information. That is in particular embodiments the LV module determines whether the receipt order information includes the needed information in order to perform the license verification process. In Step if the LV module determines the receipt order information is invalid and or incomplete the LV module sends a message to order services advising order services of the discrepancy. If the LV module determines the receipt order information is valid the LV module validates the license shown as Step . This step may involve the LV module querying account information associated with the particular customer to verify the customer has a valid license for making the purchase. For example the types of licenses that may be required for any particular purchase in the United States may involve a DEA license A DEA listed chemical license a state license a state controlled substances license and or a FDA license. The types of licenses that may be required in foreign countries such as Canada for example may involve a Health Canada Office of Controlled Substance license and or a Health Canada Precursor license. Thus for any particular order the LV module may be required to confirm the customer has one or more valid licenses to make the purchase. For instance in various embodiments the validation process is carried out by the LV module by checking one or more pieces of information associated with the particular license. For example in one embodiment the LV module may check the license expiration date the license issuance state the license issuance country a DEA list number and or a drug schedule code depending on the license number and type.

In particular embodiments when a license verification fails the LV module checks to see if updated information is available for the customer from one or more external sources shown as Step . For example the external sources may include Compliance Authority Systems the DEA and or state licensing agency. Thus in particular embodiments the LV module is configured to gather license information in real time from such sources.

In Step if updated license or alternative customer information is available from one or more external sources the LV module receives the license information from the external sources. For instance in one embodiment the LV module sends a web service request to Compliance Authority Systems requesting updated license information for the customer entering the order and Compliance Authority Systems sends back the updated information via web service to the LV module . However this is not the only method of communication that may be employed by the LV module and or external sources. For instance in particular embodiments the LV module and the external sources may be configured to perform electronic data interchange EDI over the Internet. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision various methods that may be employed to exchange information in light of this disclosure.

In Step the LV module determines whether the external sources have provided updated license information. If not the LV module records the failure to verify the license for the received receipt order verification shown as Step . Thus in particular embodiments the LV module records the failure so that such information may be used for historical purposes. In addition in particular embodiments the LV module sends one or more communications to various parties to report the failure to verify the license for the purchase. For instance in one particular embodiment the LV module sends a communication to the distributor s order services . As a result order services may discontinue processing the order for fulfillment. In addition order services may send a communication to the customer informing the customer that the required license for the purchase could not be verified. Thus in particular embodiments the customer may be provided with order status updates in real time as the order is processed shipped and or cancelled. In some instances the customer may also be provided with the specific reasons why the required license could not be verified. As a result in particular instances the customer may take corrective action based on the specific reasons with respect to the current order and or subsequent orders. For example the customer may provide updated license information using one or more webpages provided by the distributor s web services so that the current order may be processed. The same types of communications may be provided to customers with respect to suspicious order analyses in various embodiments. In addition in particular embodiments the LV module may send communications to one or more other groups and or systems on the failure such as file administration and or customer service.

On the other hand if updated license information is received the LV module updates the license information stored within the distributor s system architecture shown as Step . Thus in one particular embodiment the LV module updates the account information stored for the particular customer. Storing the license information for a variety of customers internally helps to increase the processing time to verify a license in various embodiments because the LV module is not required to query license information externally for every single verification request received. Further it is noted that in particular embodiments the distributor receives batch license information for a number of customers periodically so that the distributor s internal information may be updated on a regular basis. For example the distributor may receive batch updates from the compliance authority on a pre determined basis.

Once the license information has been updated in Step the LV module re validates the licensing using the updated information. Thus in particular embodiments this step is carried out similar to the original validation in that the LV module applies the same rules as were applied for the original validation. If the license needed for the purchase is validated the LV module records information on the receipt order passing the validation shown as Step . In addition in various embodiments the LV module send order services a communication reporting the license s required for the purchase has been validated. As a result order services continue to process the order for fulfillment. If the LV module is still unable to validate the license based on the license information obtained from the compliance authority the LV module records the failure and sends the appropriate communications to the appropriate parties shown as Step .

As previously discussed in various embodiments the RCS application may also include a SOM module . provides an exemplary process flow for determining whether a particular order is considered suspicious. This process may be carried out for the particular order in addition to or alternatively to the license verification process discussed above. In at least the illustrated embodiment of order services receives an order for a controlled and or non controlled item such as a non controlled prescription Rx or controlled substance and sends a compliance check to the RCS application . The customer placing the order may provide several pieces of information according to certain embodiments. For example similar to the license verification process the request may provide a number of different pieces of information such as an identifier for the item information identifying the customer the order quantity the date of placing the order and other related information such as the customer s shipping address. In response the RCS application is configured according to these and still other embodiments as may be desirable to invoke the SOM module as described in further detail below.

Remaining with in particular embodiments the RCS application may be configured to send a message to order services indicating the SOM analysis has been initiated. At this point the RCS application e.g. the SOM module may be configured to perform a number of checks on the information on the order to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. Once the analysis is completed the RCS application sends a message back to order services indicating whether the order has been identified as suspicious. Further the RCS application sends one or more alerts notifications to quality assurance QA regulatory affairs RA on the outcome of the analysis. In response QA RA may update order status and notes indicating the outcome of the analysis. Finally QA RA may also send a message to order services indicating whether order services should resume order flow to the next task in the flow for completing the order. As the order is further processed in particular embodiments order services may send updates to the RCS application .

As previously mentioned in various embodiments the RCS application also includes a suspicious order monitoring SOM module . This module is responsible for providing the functionality for performing a suspicious order monitoring analysis process and its associated functionality needed to support that process such as for example SOM analysis update analysis status manual SOM analysis and bulk load of SOM data via user interfaces. As also mentioned the SOM module may be configured to perform one or more checks on order information to determine whether the order is suspicious. For instance according to various embodiments the SOM module is configured to 1 analyze a customer s order quantity e.g. by checking for a particular drug code and strength unit of measure UOM against the customer s historical ordering pattern 2 analyze the customer s order quantity and frequency e.g. by checking for a particular drug code and strength unit of measure UOM against the customer s historical ordering frequency 3 analyze the customer s order quantity e.g. by checking for a particular drug code and strength unit of measure UOM against all historical orders for customers of the same type 4 analyze the customer s order quantity e.g. by checking for a particular drug code and strength unit of measure UOM against past order history for all customers of all types and 5 analyze the customer s order quantity e.g. by checking for a particular drug code and strength unit of measure UOM against the customer s historical ordering pattern for a specific client. In certain embodiments one or more of these checks may be performed in any of a variety of combinations thereof as may be desirable for particular applications. Each of these checks will now be described in greater detail in turn.

Once the SOM module has queried all of the information the SOM analysis is initiated see also whereby in Step see the SOM module applies the first check to the order. As is described in further detail below in various embodiments the first check involves the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with the order quantity history for the customer for the particular controlled substance. If the SOM module determines the order fails the first check the SOM module sets a suspicious order indicator for the order. As a non limiting example the SOM module sets the suspicious order indicator to Y as a result of the order failing the first check.

Likewise in Step the SOM module applies the second check to the order. In various embodiments the second check involves the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer and the days since the last order was shipped to the customer for the same controlled substance with the order quantity history and the days between orders for the particular customer and controlled substance. It should be appreciated that the period of time may be measured in different units besides days for various embodiments. For instance in other embodiments the SOM module may compare the number of hours minutes or months since the last order was shipped to the customer for the same controlled substance.

If the SOM module determines the order fails the second check the SOM module sets a suspicious order indicator similar to the instance in which the order fails the first check. In one embodiment the SOM module sets the same suspicious order indicator as in the case of the first check. However in another embodiment the SOM module sets a different suspicious order indicator. In this particular embodiment each check has an independent suspicious order indicator that is set as a result of the SOM module determining that the order fails the particular check. Accordingly the distributor is able to determine from the individual suspicious order indicators which checks a particular order has failed.

In Step the SOM module applies the third check to the order. In various embodiments the third check involves the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with order quantity history for orders received by customers of the same type for the controlled substance. In particular embodiments the customer type for a customer is identified by the DEA registration for the customer. If the SOM module determines the order fails the third check the module sets a suspicious order indicator. As previous described the suspicious order indicator may be the same indicator associated with the first and second checks or the indicator may be independent and associated only with the third check.

In Step the SOM module applies the fourth check to the order. In various embodiments the fourth check involves the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with order quantity history for any customer for the particular controlled substance. If the SOM module determines the order fails the fourth check the module sets a suspicious order indicator. As previously described the suspicious order indicator may be the same indicator associated with the first second and third checks or the indicator may be independent and associated only with the fourth check.

In Step the SOM module applies the fifth check to the order. In various embodiments the fifth check involves the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with order quantity history that customer with a particular client. For example the SOM module may be configured to query historical data for a retail customer s orders with manufacturer A or doctor B s orders with manufacturer C or hospital F s orders with manufacturer P. In this manner various orders with alternative manufacturers would be excluded so as to focus primarily upon historical data for a customer with a particular client or drug manufacturer. If the SOM module determines the order fails the fifth check the module sets a suspicious order indicator. As previously described the suspicious order indicator may be the same indicator associated with the first second third and fourth checks or the indicator may be independent and associated only with the fifth check.

Once the SOM module has performed the five checks in Step the module determines whether the order should be identified as suspicious. In various embodiments this involves the SOM module evaluating the suspicious order indicator s . Thus in Step if the SOM module determines that the lone indicator or one or more of the individual indicators have been set as a result of the order failing a particular check the module stores information indicating that the order has been identified as suspicious in memory. In Step the process executed by the SOM module ends according to various embodiments.

In various embodiments the SOM module simply stores information on the order in local memory residing in the application server of as also depicted in e.g. the storage device residing in the RCS application . In another embodiment the SOM module stores the information in some type of storage media. For example the storage media shown in the RCS network infrastructure depicted in . While in another embodiment the SOM module stores the information in some type of storage media that is external to the RCS network infrastructure .

Further the information stored by the SOM module may include different types of information according to various embodiments. For instance in one embodiment the SOM module simply stores the suspicious order indicator s . While in another embodiment as described below the SOM module may be configured to store information in addition to the suspicious order indicator s related to the check s performed by the module.

It should be noted that in various embodiments the SOM module may be configured to determine whether the order has failed a particular check immediately after the check has been performed. That is in these particular embodiments the SOM module may be configured to determine whether the order has failed the first check immediately after performing the first check and before performing the second check. If the order has failed the first check and the order has been identified as suspicious the SOM module may be configured to stored information on the suspicious order and not perform the remaining checks e.g. the second third fourth and fifth checks . The SOM module may be configured to perform the second third fourth and fifth check in the same way. As a result in various embodiments the SOM module may execute more quickly than in instances in which the module is configured to perform all five checks regardless of whether the order fails one of the checks.

Provided below is more detail on how the SOM module performs each of the five checks according to various embodiments of the invention. The additional detail is provided along with an example to better demonstrate the SOM module performing these checks. Thus the example is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Indeed additional specific details on the SOM module functionality may be found in U.S. Published Patent Application 2011 0238593 entitled Systems and Methods for Identifying Suspicious Orders the contents of which are hereby further incorporated herein in their entirety.

As described above in various embodiments the SOM module is configured to apply a first check to the order received by the customer to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. In particular embodiments this may entail the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with the order quantity history for the customer for the particular controlled substance. Accordingly illustrates a flow diagram of the SOM module performing the first check according to various embodiments.

As a non limiting example a customer enters an order for four hundred units of the muscle relaxant Clonazepam. In the order the Clonazepam is identified by its DEA drug code of 2737 and the customer is identified by its DEA identifier of ZZ12345678. Further the order identifies a date of Jul. 7 2009 as the order date.

As previous mentioned the SOM module receives the information on the order and queries the historical information on previous orders based on one or more parameters identified in the order information. For instance in the example the SOM module queries the historical information to retrieve a sum of the shipped quantity and the number of shipments for each ship date wherein the queried records are based on the DEA drug code for each record being 2737 e.g. Clonazepam and the customer identifier being ZZ12345678. Thus the SOM module queries the order quantity history for orders of Clonazepam received from and shipped to the customer.

It should be noted that the unit of measure for quantity may vary from order to order in particular embodiments. For instance the unit of measure for quantity may be each EA grams GM and or milliliter ML . Therefore in these particular embodiments the unit of measure may also be used as a parameter in querying records from the historical information.

Once the SOM module has queried the historical information the module performs the first check. In various embodiments the SOM module may make use of one or more control charts for this check e.g. data associated with control charts . A control chart is a tool used in statistical quality control to determine if a process is operating within a specified range or is in control. In this case in control implies that the order quantity is typical when compared to past orders. In particular embodiments the SOM module is configured to plot the order quantity by order date and use an exponentially weighted moving average EWMA chart to determine whether the order quantity stays within confidence limits based on past order history. The EWMA chart is used in these particular embodiments because the chart can adapt to small and gradual drifts in the order quantity but identify large and quick changes.

Further in various embodiments two parameters are defined prior to the SOM module creating the EWMA control chart. The first parameter is an update parameter. In various embodiments this parameter is set to a value between zero 0 and one 1 and indicates how much weight is given to the current value and how much weight is given to the previous EWMA. Values closer to one 1 direct the algorithm to weight the current order quantity more heavily and give less weight to older orders causing the EWMA to adapt more quickly to changes. In particular embodiments a default value of 0.4 is used.

The second parameter is a sigma multiplier for an upper control limit. This parameter controls the confidence level of the chart. A default value of . indicates that the control limit should be set such that 99.7 of the order quantities following a normal distribution will be within the limit. Lowering the value to 1.96 will reduce the percentage to 95 . Thus in various embodiments the tradeoff of lowering the value is identifying more false positives versus possibly missing a suspicious order with a higher value of sigma.

Therefore in various embodiments the SOM module calculates the EWMA chart based on the historical order quantities and the order quantity for the order received by the customer shown as Step . In particular embodiments the EWMA chart is sorted by shipped date. In addition in particular embodiments the SOM module calculates the standard deviation and determines the upper control limit UCL for the EWMA chart.

Thus in Step the SOM module compares the EWMA value for the order quantity for the order received from the customer with the upper control limit. In Step the SOM module determines whether the EWMA value for the order quantity is greater than the upper control limit. If the SOM module determines the EWMA value for the order quantity is greater than the upper control limit the SOM module sets the suspicious order indicator for the order shown as Step .

Therefore returning to the example the SOM module calculates the EWMA chart for the historical order quantities and the order quantity for the order received by the customer and determines that the upper control limit for the chart is 159.8 units. A non limiting and exemplary chart in this regard may be found in U.S. Published Patent Application 2011 0238593 entitled Systems and Methods for Identifying Suspicious Orders the contents of which as has been previously noted are hereby further incorporated herein in their entirety.

Further in various embodiments the SOM module is configured to apply a second check to the order received by the customer to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. In particular embodiments this may entail the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer and the days since the last order was shipped to the customer for the same controlled substance with the order quantity history and the days between orders for the particular customer and controlled substance. Accordingly illustrates a flow diagram of the SOM module performing the second check according to various embodiments.

In various embodiments the SOM module factors in a period of time e.g. number of days since the last order was shipped for the controlled substance and the order quantity on the last order to determine an order rate that is typical and then compares the order with respect to the order rate. For instance in one embodiment the SOM module uses the equation Q D N to define a line in which replenishment orders received from the customer for the controlled substance should fall close to. In the equation Q D N Q is the replenishment order quantity D is the average daily ship rate e.g. the average daily ship quantity and N is the time period e.g. number of days since the last replenishment order was placed. With the use of this equation the variability is expected to increase as the time period between orders gets larger in various embodiments. As a result the upper control limit for a control chart based on the equation is a function of both quantity and time.

Thus in Step the SOM module calculates a control chart based on the queried historical information on previous orders received from the customer for the controlled substance. For instance in one particular embodiment the control chart includes an x axis of time period between consecutive orders e.g. number of days between consecutive orders and a y axis of daily shipped quantity. A non limiting and exemplary chart in this regard may be found in U.S. Published Patent Application 2011 0238593 entitled Systems and Methods for Identifying Suspicious Orders the contents of which as has been previously noted are hereby further incorporated herein in their entirety.

Further in Step the SOM module calculates the period of time since the last order was shipped for the customer for the controlled substance. The SOM module then compares the order quantity to the upper control limit for the corresponding time period on the x axis of the control chart shown as Step . In Step the SOM module determines whether the order quantity is greater than the upper control limit that corresponds to the calculated period of time. If the SOM module determines that the order quantity is greater than the upper control limit the check module sets the suspicious order indicator for the order shown as Step . In Step the process executed by the SOM module to apply the second check ends according to various embodiments.

Thus returning to the example the SOM module calculates that is has been eight days since the previous order of Clonazepam was shipped to the customer. Therefore the SOM module determines whether the order quantity for the order of Clonazepam is greater than the upper control limit. If for example the upper control limit is calculated as units the exemplary present order quantity of units is greater than. As a result the SOM module sets the suspicious order indicator for the order.

As previously mentioned in various embodiments the SOM module is also configured to apply a third check to the order received by the customer to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. In particular embodiments this may entail the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with order quantity history for orders received by customers of the same type for the controlled substance. Accordingly illustrates a flow diagram of the SOM module performing the third check according to various embodiments.

As mentioned in various embodiments the SOM module queries historical information of previous orders for the controlled substance. Further as mentioned in various embodiments the queried record may be grouped by customer type. In particular embodiments the customer type may be the customer type assigned by the DEA. Thus in these particular embodiments the SOM module retrieves the records from the historical information with the same identifier for the controlled substance and the same customer type as the customer who placed the order. That is the SOM module may retrieve the records from the records originally queried from the historical information e.g. a subset of the queried records or the SOM module may query the historical information directly for the records.

In Step the SOM module begins the process for applying the third check by calculating a threshold value based on the queried historical information to compare to the order quantity received on the order for the controlled substance. For instance in various embodiments the SOM module simply sets the threshold value to a percentage of the historical order quantities that the order quantity for the order received must fall under. For example the threshold value may be set to 95 and therefore the order quantity must be within the order quantities of 95 of the historical orders received and shipped for the controlled substance for the customer type. Yet in other embodiments the SOM module calculates a threshold value based on using either a common or a specialized probability distribution model for the historical quantities for the customer type. As a non limiting example the SOM module may use a normal distribution and set the threshold value to the ninety fifth percentile e.g. two standard deviations of the mean .

Following the calculation the SOM module compares the order quantity on the order received from the customer with the threshold value in Step . In Step the SOM module determines whether the order quantity is greater than the threshold value. In Step if the SOM module determines the order quantity is greater than the threshold value the SOM module sets the suspicious order indicator for the order. In Step the process executed by the SOM module to apply the third check ends according to various embodiments.

Thus returning to the example the customer type for the customer who has placed the order is Retail Pharmacy. The SOM module retrieves four hundred and fifty nine records for historical orders shipped for the controlled substance Clonazepam to customers with the customer type of Retail Pharmacy. The SOM module sets the threshold value to 95 evaluates the historical order quantities for Clonazepam and determines the order quantity received for the order by the customer of is higher than 98 of the historical order quantities for customers of the same type. As a result the SOM module sets the suspicious order indicator for the order.

Further in various embodiments the SOM module is configured to apply a fourth check to the order received by the customer to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. In particular embodiments this may entail the SOM module comparing the order quantity for the order received by the customer with order quantity history for any customer for the particular controlled substance. Thus the SOM module basically performs the same steps as the third check with a different set of retrieved historical records. In this particular instance the SOM module does not limit the retrieved records to the same customer type as the customer who placed the order. The SOM module retrieves records for all of the historical orders placed and shipped for the controlled substance. An exemplary flow diagram of the SOM module performing the fourth check according to various embodiments is illustrated in .

It is worth mentioning that similar to the third check in performing the fourth check the SOM module sets a threshold value e.g. Step and determines whether the order quantity for the order received from the customer is greater than the threshold e.g. Steps . In various embodiments the SOM module sets the threshold using similar mechanisms as described above with respect to the third check. Therefore returning to the continuing non limiting example the SOM module retrieves three thousand nine hundred and seventeen historical records for orders received and shipped for Clonazepam. The SOM module sets the threshold value to 95 evaluates the historical order quantities for Clonazepam and determines the order quantity received for the order by the customer of is higher than 86 of the historical order quantities for all customers. As a result the SOM module does not set the suspicious order indicator for the order e.g. Step . In Step the process executed by the SOM module to apply the fourth check ends according to various embodiments.

Further in various embodiments the SOM module is configured to apply a fifth check to the order received by the customer to determine whether the order should be identified as suspicious. An exemplary flow diagram of the SOM module performing the fifth check according to various embodiments is illustrated in .

In particular embodiments applying the fifth check may entail the SOM module setting a threshold value e.g. Step and comparing the order quantity e.g. Step for the order received by the customer with order quantity history for that customer with a particular manufacturer i.e. client of the particular controlled substance. Thus the SOM module basically performs substantially the same steps as the third and fourth checks as described previously herein but with a different set of retrieved historical records. In this particular instance the SOM module does not limit the retrieved records to the same customer type as in the third check or leave them unlimited entirely as in the fourth check . Instead under the fifth check the SOM module retrieves records for all of the historical orders placed by a particular customer and shipped by a particular client i.e. manufacturer for the controlled substance.

Similar to the third and fourth checks the SOM module sets a threshold value e.g. Step and then determines whether the order quantity for the order received from the customer is greater than the threshold e.g. Step . In various embodiments the SOM module sets the threshold using similar mechanisms as described above with respect to the third and fourth checks. Therefore returning to the example the SOM module retrieves a certain number of historical records for orders received from Customer A and shipped by Manufacturer B for Clonazepam. The SOM module sets the threshold value to 95 evaluates the historical order quantities for Clonazepam associated with this particular customer and manufacturer and determines the order quantity received for the order by the customer of is higher than 86 of the historical order quantities. As a result the SOM module may set the suspicious order indicator for the order e.g. Step after which point in Step the process of applying the fifth check ends.

As previously mentioned in various embodiments information may be gathered and stored related to various license verifications and suspicious order analyses performed. Further in various embodiments the distributor may provide one or more user interfaces for collecting and displaying this stored information. In particular embodiments the distributor may also provide one or more interfaces that allow the performance of what if analyses on orders for customers before receiving the orders and to view the results from the analyses and either save or discard them.

In particular embodiments the distributor may provide customers with the ability to view all historical license verifications and suspicious order analyses for the particular customers. In addition such capability may allow customers and other parties to perform auditing of order activities and other system activities such as for example activities involving license data updates additions and or deletions and activities involving performing what if analyses. The distributor may further provide reporting capabilities for customers on historical information and or auditing results. Such features among other benefits facilitate proactive troubleshooting of potential roadblocks and or issues thereby minimizing instances of invalid licenses and or orders identified retroactively as suspicious.

Further in particular embodiments the distributor may implement a security framework to regulate the use of such interfaces and or any of the various module previously described herein. For instance the distributor may implement role based permissions to control a user s ability to update license information and or to view and discard various analyses performed. For example such role based permissions may include a manager role that allows for a user with such a role to view a trail on who has added modified and or deleted license data and or a view role that only allows a user with such a role to view historical license verification and or suspicious order information.

Still further in various embodiments as has been previously described herein one or more notifications may be provided to one more parties upon occurrence of certain events. As non limiting examples beyond those previously described the RCS application may be configured to send notifications to certain groups i.e. individual corporate sub entities or the like upon license verification request failures upon SOM analysis failures and or upon identification of a need for manual SOM input from one or more parties within the groups. Still other configurations and or combinations thereof may be envisioned as commonly understood in the art for notifying various users of applications and systems upon the occurrence of certain events whether negative in nature or otherwise. As yet another non limiting example the SOM module may be configured to notify a user when all performed checks have been successfully passed thereby resulting in an approved transaction.

Still further specific examples of interfaces that may be provided in various embodiments include 1 a license verification web services interface that serves as an entry point for performing all license data verification for orders and receipts 2 a suspicious order monitoring web services interface that serves as an entry point for performing all SOM data analysis 3 a SOM analysis response interface to respond back to a source system e.g. order services that requests a suspicious order analysis check and provide details of the SOM analysis performed on an order with results 4 a compliance authority e.g. Compliance Authority Systems verification web service interface that serves as an entry point for obtaining license data to be use in performing license verification 5 a compliance authority bulk load and file upload interface that allows for bulk upload and files of license information from compliance authorities and 6 a SOM file upload interface that allows for users to upload bulk SOM records to be analyzed by the RCS application . One such non limiting and exemplary interface is shown in .
