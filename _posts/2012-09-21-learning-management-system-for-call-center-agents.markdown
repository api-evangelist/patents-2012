title: Learning management system for call center agents
abstract: A learning management system provides e-learning to call center agents. Agents can receive training provided in various training formats, which are characterized as fixed-time, flex-time, human-initiated, or system-initiated. A training process flow illustrates how the various training formats can be provided using processes involving agent selection, registration, scheduling, content delivery, and post-training reporting. A modular system provides the training flow and coordinates the function of various call center components to provide training in a seamless and integrated manner using existing call center scheduling systems, such as workflow management components.

Call centers often employ a number of agents for handling inbound and outbound calls. The nature and purpose of the calls may vary greatly over a short time. For example outbound calling campaigns may involve originating calls to collect debts solicit donations for a non profit organization or offer new products for sale. Agents assigned to these campaigns must be familiar with the appropriate debt collection practices the non profit organization for which donations are sought or the products being offered for sale. These same agents may also be involved in handling inbound calls and may be required to answer questions associated with various products customers seeking service etc. These agents must be trained in a variety of areas including trained in operating the call center computer workstations interacting with other customer information systems for updating customer records researching product features or for being familiar with guidelines and policies associated with a telemarketing campaign. Additionally it is not uncommon for employee turnover in call centers to be relatively high requiring continual training of new agents.

Training of the agents is important since training increases their effectiveness. Failure to train an agent can result in a poor customer service loss of revenue and other adverse impacts. Thus an efficient and effective infrastructure for training call agents is necessary.

Training systems for providing computer based learning allow each agent to receive training in a manner that suits the agent s schedule. Some training systems are designed to be locally executed on the agent s computer while other training systems can be hosted on a server and provided to the agent via network interconnection.

However such training systems are not integrated into the call center infrastructure and cause additional administrative burdens to coordinate training between the agent call handling systems and the training infrastructure. Thus the administration process of accomplishing agent training is distinct from scheduling the agent for their work schedule and when the training break arrives the agent cannot seamlessly transition from handling calls to receiving training and vice versa. This can increase the complexity and cost for the call center provider in addition complicating the administration of training both for the call center administrator as well as the agent.

Thus an integrated approach for administering training to call center agents is required and it is in regard to this and other aspects that the present disclosure is presented.

Technologies are generally presented herein pertaining to a learning management system for providing training courses which can be provided to call center agents in one embodiment. Various training formats are accommodated that can be categorized as being flex time or fixed time and further categorized as being initiated by a human or by a computer system. The provision of training is described as a training flow that may include various processes depending on the training format of the training course. These processes may include in one embodiment an agent selection process a registration process a scheduling process a content delivery process and a post training reporting process. These processes may be coordinated by a workflow manager that in part determines which processes are involved in the training flow.

The above processes may generate and or modify data in an agent training list. The agent training list may include training context data that may be used by the various processes to perform training related operations as appropriate for the specific training format. For example the training context data may be used to indicate whether a course can be suspended and resumed or how the training content delivery is to be initiated.

An architecture for one embodiment is disclosed involving components found in a call center and which may include a call handling system a workflow manager an agent s workstation various databases and an e learning module that may be incorporated in a e learning system or in another system. The e learning module may comprise further modules including but not limited to one or more an agent selection modules a registration module a schedule module an interface module to a content delivery system a post training reporting module a course data and training management module. A workflow manager coordinates operation involving the above modules.

The architecture uses various data structures that allow appropriate information to be maintained about the training status and how courses are to be provided to agent. The architecture allows training to be provided to agents in a flexible and adaptable manner and allows various levels of integration with operation of the call center components.

The subject matter disclosed herein may be implemented as a computer controlled apparatus a computer process a computing system or as an article of manufacture such as a computer readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the associated drawings.

This Summary is provided to exemplify concepts in a high level form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that address any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

Various embodiments for practicing the technologies disclosed herein are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all embodiments of the technologies disclosed are shown. Indeed the embodiments disclosed herein are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements and should not be construed as limiting or precluding other embodiments applying the teachings and concepts disclosed herein. Like numbers in the drawings refer to like elements throughout.

Inbound voice calls may originate from calling parties using a variety of phone types. A calling party may originate a call from a conventional analog telephone connected to a public switched telephone network PSTN using an analog plain old telephone service POTS line . The calls may be routed by the PSTN and may comprise various types of facilities including but not limited to T1 trunks SONET based fiber optic networks ATM networks etc. Various types of routers switches bridges gateways and other types of equipment may be involved in the processing of a call.

Inbound voice calls may also originate from a mobile device such as a smart phone or tablet which wirelessly communicates with a mobile service provider MSP . The voice calls may be routed to the PSTN using an integrated services digital network ISDN interface or other types of interfaces that are well known to those skilled in the art. The MSP may also route calls as packetized voice referred to herein as voice over IP VoIP to an Internet provider using Internet based protocols. For convenience unless indicated otherwise the term trunk refers to any type of facility or providing voice calls to or from the call center regardless of the type of protocol or technology used. Specifically a trunk as referred to herein is not limited to time division multiplexing TDM technology.

Voice calls may also originate from a calling party employing a so called IP phone VoIP phone or soft phone . In one embodiment this device may comprise a computing device such as a laptop desktop or computing tablet which interfaces with a headphone microphone combination also referred to as a headset . An IP phone may use a digital voice control protocol and may process packetized voice data according to various Internet based voice protocols such as session initiated protocol SIP . The call may be conveyed by other types of Internet providers such as a cable company providing Internet access services over a coaxial cable facility . Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of protocols and facilities may be used to convey voice calls.

The term telephone call as used herein is generally synonymous with a voice call unless indicated otherwise. Further the term telephone call may encompass a voice call originating from any type of device such as a soft phone conventional telephone a mobile device or other device known in the art. The term call as used herein may mean an active instance of two way communication an attempt to establish two way communication or a portion of the two way communication. For example a user at a conventional telephone can dial a telephone call in an attempt to establish two way communication and a call can be said to exist even prior to establishment of a two way connection. In another example a call may be put on hold and a portion of the call may be referred to as a call leg existing between the caller and certain equipment. A call may comprise a number of concatenated call legs as known to those skilled in the art. In certain contexts which will be made explicit the call may encompass communications other than voice e.g. text messages video chat facsimile etc.

Inbound calls from callers to the call center may be received at an automatic call distributor ACD . The ACD may be a specialized switch for receiving and routing inbound calls under various conditions. The ACD may be embodied as a dedicated form of equipment readily available from various manufacturers or the ACD can be a so called soft switch comprising a suitable programming module executed by a processing device to perform the necessary functions. The ACD may route an incoming call over call center facilities to an available agent. The facilities may be any suitable technology for conveying the call including but not limited to a local area network LAN wide area network WAN ISDN or conventional TDM circuits. The facilities may be the same or different from the facilities used to transport the call to the ACD .

Calls may be routed over facilities to an agent for servicing. That is the party may speak with an agent for receiving for example customer service. The physical area at which the agent sits is often referred to as an agent position and these positions are often grouped into clusters that are managed by a supervisor who may monitor calls and the agents productivity. An agent usually uses a computing device such as a computer and a voice device . The combination of computer and voice device may be referred to as a workstation. Thus the workstation collectively has a data capability and a voice capability though separate devices may be used. In some instances workstation may be used in reference to specifically either the data or voice capability at the agent s position as appropriate to the context. For example routing the call to the agent s workstation means routing a call to one of the voice devices at the agent s position. Similarly routing the call to the agent means routing a call to the appropriate equipment at an agent s position.

The voice device used by an agent may be a soft phone device exemplified by a headset connected to the computer . The soft phone may be virtual telephone implemented in part by an application program executing in a computer. The phone may also comprise an Internet Protocol IP based headset or a conventional phone . Use of the term phone is intended to encompass all these types of voice devices used by an agent unless indicated otherwise.

An agent typically logs onto their workstation prior to handling calls. This allows the call center to know which agents are available for handling calls. The ACD may also maintain data of an agent s skill level that is used to route a specific call to the agent or group of agents having the same skill level. If a suitable agent is not available to handle a call the ACD may queue the call for the next available agent. As can be expected various algorithms may be employed to process calls in an efficient manner.

Two types of signaling information may be provided with the inbound call that the ACD uses in processing the call. The first type of signaling information indicates the telephone number dialed by the caller and is frequently referred to as DNIS derived from the Dialed Number Identification Service associated with this capability. A call center may provide various services such as sales customer service technical support etc. each of which may be associated with a different telephone number e.g. multiple toll free 800 numbers . The DNIS can be used by the ACD to determine the purpose of the call and potentially identify a group of agents having the appropriate skill level to handle the call. The ACD may prioritize and route calls to an agent based on the required skill level. Skills based routing may be a rule based set of instructions that the ACD uses to handle calls. Skills based routing may be implemented by the ACD or by the ACD interacting with a computer telephone integrated CTI server .

The CTI server may be incorporated in a call center to control and or coordinate other components of the call center architecture . Specifically the CTI server may interact with the ACD to coordinate call processing. Thus in some embodiments the CTI server may control the routing of calls from the ACD to the various agent workstations and or provide data to other components processing the call. The CTI server may also provide call reporting functionality based on data collected during calls.

The second type of signaling information that may be provided with an inbound call is the calling telephone number often referred to as automatic number identification or ANI. In one configuration the ACD and or CTI server may use the ANI of an incoming call to retrieve caller information from a data store and provide the data to the agent s workstation computer along with routing the call to the agent s workstation phone. For example the ANI can also be used to ascertain a party s status e.g. a Gold Level customer warranting premium service to facilitate the ACD routing the call to a select group of agents. The data store can be a database storing records of caller information. The data store can be integrated with the CTI server the ACD or segregated as a standalone database. Thus the call and associated call data retrieved from the data store are presented at the agent s headset and their computer . In other embodiments data may be stored in the data store by the agent ACD or other entity.

The ACD may place a call in a queue if there are no suitable agents available or it may route the call to an interactive voice response server IVR to play voice prompts. These prompts may be in a menu type structure and the IVR may collect and analyze responses from the party in the form of dual tone multiple frequency DMTF tones and or speech. The IVR may be used to further identify the purpose of the call to the CTI server such as prompting the party to enter account information or otherwise obtain information used to service the call. The IVR may interact with other servers such as the CTI server or the data store in order to retrieve or provide information for processing the call. In other configurations the IVR may be used to only provide announcements.

The interaction between the ACD IVR CTI server agent computers as well as other components may involve using a local area network LAN . Other communication configurations are possible such as but not limited to using a wide area network wireless network router bridge direct point to point links etc.

When an agent is interacting with a called or calling party the agent may use their workstation computer to further interact with other enterprise computing systems such as a customer relationship management CRM server . A CRM server may be used to integrate information from various enterprise business systems to facilitate the agent servicing the call. A variety of applications may be provided by a CRM server .

In addition to receiving inbound communications including voice calls emails and facsimiles and the call center may also originate communications to a called party referred to herein as outbound communications. In some embodiments a call center may employ a dialer such as a predictive dialer to originate outbound calls on behalf of an agent at a rate designed to meet various criteria. Similar to the other components within the call center architecture the dialer may comprise one or more software modules executing on processing device hardware platform.

The dialer is typically configured to dial a list of telephone numbers to initiate outbound calls which can be accomplished in one embodiment by instructing the ACD to originate calls. In some embodiments the ACD may include functionality for originating calls and if so this component may be referred to as a private automatic branch exchange PBX or PABX . In other embodiments not shown the dialer may directly interface with voice trunks using facilities to the PSTN for originating calls. After the calls are originated a transfer operation by the ACD or the dialer may connect the call with an agent or place the call in a queue for an available agent. In the latter case announcements or music may be provided to the party. In various embodiments the dialer may make use of one or more algorithms to determine how and when to dial a list of numbers so as to minimize the likelihood of a called party being placed in a queue while maintaining target agent utilization.

Another component that may be employed in a call center is a workforce management WFM . This component maintains information to generate agent s schedules to effectively handle inbound outbound calls. The WFM may maintain historical call volume information for call campaigns and forecast expected call volume to predict the number of agents needed to handle the call volume at a defined service level. The WFM can then apply information about available agents to then generate a work roster of agents. In other words the WFM schedules agents for their work shifts according to the anticipated needs of the call campaigns.

Finally in various embodiments the call center architecture may include an e learning system to perform various training related functions. The e learning system may coordinate other components to provide training to agents. In some embodiments the e learning system could be a distinct system that cooperates with the WFM or the e learning system could comprise a module incorporated in the WFM . Various embodiments are possible and only illustrates one embodiment. Further details on the e learning architecture will be discussed below.

An agent may be considered as having one of four different states when working. Thus these can be said to describe the agent during a shift. During a shift the agent is logged in to the ACD and or the WFM. The agent may be available and ready for receiving calls if any are present. This can be described as the ready mode. If the agent is connected and speaking with a caller then the agent can be described as being in the connected mode. Once the call terminates the agent may have additional work to perform including recording notes on the caller s record. This can be described as after call work . Once the caller has indicated a disposition the agent returns to the ready mode. In addition the agent can be removed from the ready mode by being placed into a pause mode. The ACD suspends offering calls to the agent. The agent may enter the pause mode by another entity e.g. the supervisor or the agent may request entering the pause mode. If the agent requests entering the pause mode they are usually prompted to enter a pause code. This indicates the nature of the break such as a lunch break bathroom break etc. Typically if the agent is in the connected mode and requests entry into the pause mode the call is allowed to complete e.g. requesting the pause mode does not interrupt a current call. The ready mode connect mode after call work mode and the pause mode all occur when the agent is logged in to the ACD. When the agent logs off or logs out then none of the above states can exist. Thus the above states presume that the agent is logged in. An agent that is not logged in is presently working their shift and would be off the clock. 

Although the above components may be variously referred to as servers each may be also referred to as a processing device unit component or system and may incorporate a local data store or database or interface with an external database. Use of the word server herein does not require the component to interact in a client server arrangement using web based protocols with other components although that may be the case. Further the above components may be located remotely from or co located with other components. Furthermore one or more of the components may be implemented on a single processing device to perform the functions described herein. For example in various embodiments one or more functionalities of the ACD the IVR server the CRM server the CTI server and or the dialer may be combined into single hardware platform executing one of more software modules. In addition the call center architecture may be provided as a hosted solution where the call processing functionality is provided as a communication service a so called communication as a service or CaaS to a call center operator. Thus there is no requirement that the servers identified above actually be located or controlled by a call center operator. Specifically the learning management system disclosed herein can be provided in a hosted basis in a variety of configurations.

In addition the agent positions can be co located in a single physical call center or in multiple physical call centers. The agents can be remotely located from the other components of the call center and may also be remotely located from each other sometimes referred to as a virtual call center. A virtual call center may describe a scenario where agents work at home using their own computers and telephones as workstations. In some configurations a single physical location of the call center may not be readily identifiable. This may occur when the call processing functions are provided as a service in a hosted cloud computing environment and the agents positions are in their individual residences.

Those skilled in art will recognize represents one possible configuration of a call center architecture and that variations are possible with respect to the protocols configuration facilities technologies and equipment used. The specific components that are present in a call center may vary and for this reason a generic term of a call handling system will be used.

The training flow refers to the high level sequence of operations or functions associated with accomplishing agent training. These operations may variously involve other call center system components and may involve interaction with various individuals including agents receiving the training and individuals administrating the training. The training flow may involve a different number of high level processes depending on the embodiment. The number of high level training processes involved in the training flow operations depends on the training format provided. For purposes of illustration embodiments involving four or five high level processes are disclosed. In other embodiments the functions and operations may be combined so that a greater or fewer number of high level processes are involved in the training flow.

Thus it should be recognized that different sequences of high level operations may be involved for different forms of agent training. In some embodiments a subset of the same operations may be involved whereas additional training types may be defined in other cases.

The training flow disclosed herein can be used to describe actions associated with four common training formats or training types. These are referred to as 

The descriptions provided herein may reference agent training or use the word agent in reference to the form of training e.g. conventional scheduled agent training . The inclusion of the word agent should not be construed as limiting the concepts to only call center agents as the concepts and technologies may be applied to other types of employees individuals or persons. Specifically the use of a call center is not meant to limit the principles herein from being applied to other applications. Further although four main training formats are described other training variations are possible that can be described using the training flow processes.

The four training formats are given a label for simplicity of identification. The four training formats can be also described in terms of two categories 1 training format type which can be either fixed time or flex time and 2 training initiation which can be human initiated or system initiated. Thus four combinations are possible each of which is associated with one of the four above mentioned labels.

The training format that can be fixed time or flex time. Fixed time refers to training that is scheduled to occur at a given time. In other words a time is set at which training is to be provided. Flex time refers to training that is not constrained to be provided at a certain time but can occur whenever initiated within limits.

The training initiation can be human initiated or system initiated. Human initiated is training for an agent that involve human input which is typically either a call center administrator or training coordinator Administrator or the agent. System initiated is training that is initiated as the result of a non human intervention e.g. automatic intervention by e.g. a computer system. The four combinations could also be referred to as 

Conventional scheduled training CST is fixed time training that is initiated by the Administrator fixed time human initiated . In other words the training session is scheduled to occur at a certain time fixed time and the Administrator has determined that the training should occur human initiated . Stated another way the immediate triggering of the training was caused at some level by the Administrator.

A byproduct of fixed time or scheduled training is that the training can only be scheduled with the granularity of the scheduling system providing agent scheduling. For example if scheduling only allows scheduling of training sessions on the hour or half hour for an agent then CST can be scheduled on the hour or half hour. In addition to start times scheduled training sessions also have an end time. In some embodiments the scheduling intervals are 15 minute intervals on the quarter hour so that training can be scheduled to the nearest 15 minute starting time. Although fixed time training does not require content to be delivered for the entire training session the schedule ending of the training session does coincide with the scheduling interval. In other words if scheduling occurs at 15 minute intervals then a training session typically begins and ends on those intervals. If the training content ends earlier then there may be some incidental time during the training session when training content is not actually being delivered to the agent.

Generally with fixed time scheduling the training session occurs when scheduled. The training session may not begin at the exact second since the agent is usually allowed to complete an active call as opposed to having the call abruptly terminated at the designated beginning of the training session. For illustration purposes it will be assumed that the training session is able to start when scheduled and that the agent is not on a call at that time. In one embodiment the CHS will stop offering calls to the agent at the beginning of the training session Thus unless intervention of some sort is defined the agent will progress to the training session if available even if call volumes for that agent call center or campaign are at high levels.

Automatically scheduled training AST fixed time system initiated is fixed time training that is initiated by a system not by the Administrator or the agent. Although an Administrator may have been involved in authorizing training for the agent the direct scheduling of the training is attributed to the learning management system as programmed. Note that the Administrator may define rules which the learning management system uses to select the agent.

In fixed time training of either type the agent may be informed of an upcoming training session. The agent may even be queried to confirm that they will accept the agent training. If offered to the agent but the agent declines then an exception condition may be reported. Generally it would be unusual for the Administrator to schedule CST training for an agent which the agent then refuses to participate in. However in CST form of training allowing the agent to accept or decline may be desirable. In one embodiment the agent may be only able to defer the start time of the training session for a brief amount when presented with the notification of the training session such as to institute a bathroom break before starting the training session .

There are two forms of flex time training. Flex time training is not limited to the time boundaries as is a scheduled training session. One form of on demand training is initiated by the training system and called snippet training flex time system triggered . Snippet training is further disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 454 841 entitled Non Scheduled Training For An Agent In a Call Center filed on Apr. 24 2012 the contents of which are incorporated by reference for all that it teaches. The other form of flex training is called on demand training ODT . On demand is training is not scheduled to occur at a fixed time but is initiated by the agent flex time human triggered . Flex time training is not limited to occurring at only certain times that coincide with scheduling intervals as is the case with fixed time scheduling. Thus flex time training is not limited by scheduling intervals that may exist in the scheduling systems of a call center.

Flex time may be in some embodiments bounded by training windows during which training may be though not necessarily provided. For example in one embodiment the time windows coincide with the agent s shift so that whenever the agent is working the agent is eligible to receive flex training. Other embodiments may conditions when flex time training cannot be provided or indicate only certain times when it may be provided. For example restrictions may be defined that prohibit all agents from requesting flex time training at the same time or spending more than a certain percentage of their time training. Flex time training could also be accessed by an agent outside of their normal shift hours. Further distinctions of each form of training will be provided below.

Whereas flex time may be triggered and end based on various conditions such as call volumes fixed time training sessions usually begin and end independent of such other conditions and are only dependent on time. Thus in some embodiments it would be unusual to interrupt or terminate a fixed time training session because of an increase in call volume.

CST reflects a common embodiment where an Administrator schedules training for an agent at a certain time. CST provides a convenient basis to illustrate the operations in the training flow since it is conventional for agents to be scheduled for training in call centers. For example agents participating in a new call campaign contracted to start in two months in a call center may be scheduled for training by the Administrator on the day prior to the start of the campaign. Using the training flow for CST as a baseline it can be seen how variations to the training flow can illustrate the other training formats.

The use of the phrase training session generally refers to a period of time where training occurs. A training session can be potentially fixed time or flex time. A training session by itself does not necessarily imply an identified training course content but that some form of training is provided. The use of the phrase training course generally refers to a particular training course provided during a training session. In certain cases the phrases may be used interchangeably such as scheduling a training session and scheduling a training course. The use of the term training course does not limit the application of the principles herein from being used to present other forms of materials including e.g. entertainment games contests general instruction etc. Thus the training session could provide any form of interactive interface. However the principles of the concepts and technologies are illustrated in the context of providing training session. Thus although the content delivered is referred to as training content it could easily be other forms of content.

Although the embodiments describing the concepts and technologies herein presume that the activity involves a training session in other embodiments the activity at this processing stage may another form. For example the overall training flow described herein may be applied for scheduling an audition and the activity is an audition performance by a performer as opposed to a training session involving an agent. As noted before for the sake of brevity the concepts herein are illustrated using an embodiment involving delivering training content to agents.

Turning to an overview of the training flow is illustrated that is associated with CST training fixed time human initiated . There are up to five distinct high level processes which may be associated in this embodiment of the training flow . In some embodiments of the training flow a given high level process may be absent or there may be a variation as to how a given process may occur. In general each individual training flow produces an output of some form which is diagrammatically shown to the right of the corresponding process. In there are five processes namely the section process the registration process the scheduling process the content delivery process and the post training reporting process . The corresponding outputs of a process may be lists schedules results or other data structures.

The selection process is the initial high level process in the training flow. Although shown as a single process there are two variations which could alternately have been shown as two separate sub processes. However because there is similarity for many of the aspects this is shown as a single process. The two main variations are 

The selection process receives Administrator input . The Administrator input may involve different forms and user interfaces to select agents for training. In a simple embodiment the agent training selection inputs may involve identifying a file listing agents identified by the Administrator for training. In other embodiments various agent selection tools AST may be defined in the selection process and used by the Administrator to select the agents. The AST could be a wizard based program allowing the Administrator to select various criteria for selecting agents for training. This may involve selecting agents or combinations or subsets based on seniority skills work schedules contract terms pay scale employee type full time or part time prior training history or other criteria. The wizard may prompt the Administrator for agent selection criteria allowing identifying agents that meet certain defined qualifications. In other embodiments the AST may be based on a structured database query language and may involve the Administrator providing a textual based query for a database search. For example the Administrator could select all agents lacking a certain skill level available on a certain date for training. In other embodiments the AST could involve a graphical user interface GUI allowing the Administrator to select agents from a list of scheduled agents and variously construct a list of agents to be trained. In each case agents to receive training are identified. Thus there are various forms that could be used to receive the manual agent selection input . The Administrator may also provide or be prompted for other inputs which indicate which course agents are to receive the nature of the training format application of other conditions rules limitations etc.

The output of the selection process is referred to as an agent training list ATL . At this point during the training flow the ATL comprises a list of agents associated with training courses as well as other information. As will be evident there are various forms of the ATL that may be produced by the training flow processes which account for the different training formats. Subsequent processes in the training flow may either generate further information which can be manifested in another distinct ATL or that may supplement the data structure in the ATL. In other words various embodiments may define an initial ATL that is modified at various stages of the training flow whereas other embodiments may define different ATLs that are associated together in some manner. This is an implementation aspect which may vary and either form is within the scope of the concepts presented herein. For sake of illustration and not for limitation it is presumed that the ATL is initially produced by the selection process and is modified in subsequent processes.

To distinguish between the various instances of the ATL as modified by a particular process a qualifier may preface the word ATL. For example the ATL produced by the selection process may be further referred to as a Selected ATL SEL ATL referring to the agents that have been selected for training by the selection process . This input could be a list of agents to take a particular course which becomes the genesis of the Selected ATL.

The Selected ATL is generated by the selection process which in one embodiment is based on Administrator input. In another embodiment the Administrator may define criteria which is further processed from which the selection process identifies agents. Thus in various embodiments different levels of processing may be required by the selection process to identify the agents.

The Administrator may also indicate which training courses are involved with the agents. The training course is typically identified by a course identifier course ID which identifies the subject matter that the agent is to receive training and which may allow retrieval of other information providing details of the training. In other embodiments a course name may be used. As long as the identifier is unique either format may be used. In other embodiments the Administrator may request the selection process to identify courses that certain agents have not been trained on and therefore the selection process determines the course to be associated with the agent.

The generation of the Selected ATL during the selection process typically identifies at least one agent and associates that agent with a training course or vice versa . This often involves generating a record using a record structure that not only identifies the agent and course but further includes additional information associated with completing the training process. This additional information beyond the agent name and course provides information on the training context and this data may be collectively referred to as a training context data TCD . In other embodiments the ATL may simply link to another record of data indicating the TCD. For purposes of illustration it is assumed that the TCD is incorporated into the ATL hence a record in the ATL and the associated TCD may be one and the same record.

The specific data elements in the TCD used by a given process in the training flow may be a subset of the TCD. Further each subset of TCD used by a given process may vary according to the process. Further the TCD stored in the ATL may be augmented or modified by a process during the training flow. In many examples TCD may be generated by one process in the training flow and then subsequently used by another process in the training flow.

The TCD provides information about the training to be provided including the course duration course prerequisites the training format etc. Any information needed to accomplish the training flow may be stored in the TCD and may be generated by or during various processes or received from the Administrator input.

The next process in the training flow is the registration process that may begin after the selection process has generated an ATL of selected agents. The purpose of the registration process is to register the agents identified in the previously generated Selected ATL. Registration may involve determining whether various conditions and requirements are met so that the agent can be registered to take the course. This process may be thought of as a screening process to ensure that agents are eligible to receive training. Eligibility may be based on examining course related information and or rules established that may limit registration. In other words the Selected ATL merely identifies agents for which training is desired. The registration process ensures that the selected agents can actually take or receive the training courses. Thus the Selected ATL has to be processed to ensure that the agents can actually take the course as desired.

Screening may involve for example determining whether the agent has met the indicated course pre requisites. For example a training course may only be available for agents who have completed certain prior training courses who have a minimum seniority level or have a minimum skill level. The screening may involve a so called white list approved items as well as a black list prohibited items . In other words pre requisites may be predicated on certain requirements being present or being absent. For example a course may require an agent to have at least 6 months work experience before registering for a course or the course may not be open to agents having less than 6 months work experience.

Other restrictions may be examined to determine whether an agent can register for a course. These include course capacity cost or other non schedule restrictions. For example a training course may be associated with a fixed capacity. The capacity may be due to classroom size a maximum number of students that have been contracted to receive training or software licensing restrictions. Hence a limited number of agents can be registered as students. In some embodiments wait listing may occur.

Other restrictions may be defined as rules which prohibit for example an agent from receiving training where travel is required to attend the training session. Other restrictions could limit classroom based instruction only to agents living in the same metropolitan area. For example an agent based in Florida may be precluded from registering for a facility based training course offered in California but the same agent may be able to register for the same course if offered in Florida. A call center may have a list of agents which are explicitly excluded from receiving training courses or who have already received training. The number and type of restrictions may vary greatly in different embodiments.

The registration process can apply separate rules or criteria for flex time and fixed time training. A course may be offered to an agent only on a fixed time basis or a flex time basis. Indeed some course material is better suited for delivery in a fixed time format. Other course material may be adapted to delivery in short and unscheduled formats. Some courses may be mandatory whereas some may be optional and may require supervisor approval.

The output of the registration process is a list of agents registered for training courses referred to as the registered ATL R ATL . This list represents agents that are registered i.e. can receive the training course. Again in various embodiments the R ATL could be embodied as a separate list or as information that is added to the Selected ATL.

The next process in the training flow may be the scheduling process . This process is optional and may not be present in all training flows. If present the scheduling process may begin any time after the registration process completes. The scheduling process may receive as input the R ATL . The purpose of the scheduling process is to schedule agents indicated in the R ATL as receiving fixed time training.

Scheduling may involve determining whether the indicated agent can be scheduled for the course in light of various scheduling requirements rules and conditions. If so e.g. the agent can be scheduled then one of the results may be a defined time for when the indicated agent is to receive training. In some embodiments the time for when training is to occur is provided as an input by the Administrator. If so then the scheduling process is simplified.

The scheduling process by its very nature involves scheduling an agent for fixed time training. Thus the scheduling process is absent if flex time training is involved. Specifically the scheduling process is used for CST and for AST which are both forms of fixed time training but not for flex time training.

For other forms of training that are flex time e.g. snippet and on demand training there is no set time that the agent must receiving training so the scheduling process may be by passed. For purposes of this illustration which is based on CST the scheduling process is used to schedule an agent to receive training at a defined time. The scheduling process uses as input the R ATL .

The output of the scheduling process is an ATL list that may include the scheduled training times for the agents. This may be referred to herein as a scheduled ATL SCH ATL since the times for receiving training are indicated in the ATL. As will be discussed in some embodiments the information generated by the scheduling process may be kept in a separate file from the R ATL. This is because the scheduling function may be implemented using the scheduling engine in the WFM of a call center and the training related scheduling information can be stored along with the agent s work schedule.

In other embodiments to generate the SCH ATL the R ATL may be augmented with further information to create the SCH ATL.

The next process in the training flow is the content delivery process . The content delivery process may have different forms but it is present in some form whenever training is provided. In some embodiments the delivery of content may be computer based web based or another form of e learning. In other embodiments content delivery can be highly manual in nature such as a lecture provided by an instructor in a classroom. For purposes herein reference to a content delivery system refers to an electronic based system for facilitating delivery of content of various types unless otherwise stated. A content delivery system would encompass for example computer based web based or other forms involving computers. It is possible for the training flow to work with a manual content delivery process as will be seen but the greatest efficiencies and benefits of the technologies disclosed herein often involve delivery of e learning content.

In the context of CST the content delivery occurs at the scheduled time which is indicated in the SCH ATL . Other forms of training may occur in a non scheduled manner. For example on demand training may involve delivery of content when the agent requests training.

When the training content is delivered in a fixed time manner the delivery may be coordinated with the CHS. The CHS may be instructed to automatically pause the agent at the appropriate time when a training session is to begin and may be instructed to resume call handling at the end of the training session to resume the agent s call handling. To resume the agent is to return them to the ready mode. This integrated approach allows a seamless transition for the agent from handling calls receiving training and then returning back to receiving calls. Further in an integrated approach the agent is not required to log out from the CHS and log in to the CDS or learning management system. The CDS is informed as to the agent receiving training and there is no need to replicate the identification and validation procedures associated with logging in to the CHS.

At the end of the content delivery process the agent has received the training which can be in various training formats. The content delivery process generates an ATL list that reflects the training received by the agents. This may be referred to herein as a completed training ATL CT ATL . This essentially updates the ATL to reflect the training provided.

The training content itself can be in various forms. As noted can be an e learning type of delivery involving interactive presentations multi media videos or voice narratives. The content delivery may comprise an information presentation part followed by an optional testing part. The test may reflect that the agent comprehended the concepts presented and a minimum level may be required to pass. In other embodiments a series of learning modules may be presented as a curriculum and optionally followed by a testing module.

The content delivery process may occur well after the scheduling process occurs. It is common for an agent to be scheduled for a training session weeks in advance so that the agent is prepared for a new call campaign before it begins. The content delivery process may be of varying duration. The training content can be a few minutes to several hours long. For example a scheduled training session can easily last several hours while a snippet training session may last a few minutes.

The next process to occur in the training flow is the post training reporting process PTR process . The PTR process involves reporting results of the training content delivered to the agent and may involve updating an agent training profile. For example an agent completing a training course may have their training profile updated to reflect that the agent has completed the training and has successfully passed a testing module leading to an updated skill The PTR process may also update the CHS so that skills based routing in the CHS is updated appropriately.

The data updated by the PTR process is called the Agent Training Profile ATP . The ATP may be considered a special case of the ATL or it may be considered as a separate data structure. One distinction is that the ATL data may be more transient as compared to data in the ATP. In one embodiment the ATL reflects a temporary list of agent training related records but the ATP is a more permanent result of the training process. Thus the ATL may be erased after training and the permanent results stored in the ATP. Thus for purposes of illustration the ATL is presumed to contain the short term training related results and any data in the ATL that is then stored on a long term basis is termed the ATP.

Specific examples of ATP would include the dates and courses that an agent has completed along with optional test scores and other training certifications. In some embodiments minimal information is retained in the ATP. For example the only long term data retained as ATP may be the update skill level of an agent that is updated in the CHS. In this embodiment the dates time courses delivered to an agent could be erased. The choice of what and how much data to retain as ATP may vary.

The specifics of the PTR process depend in part on the training format of the training. In the example provided above CST the training involved e learning provided at a fixed time and an automated routine may update the ATP. In other embodiments such as with classroom based instruction a course instructor may provide inputs that are processed and used to update the ATP. Thus even manually provided data can be received by the PTR process .

The overall training flow in shows that all five processes selection process registration process scheduling process content delivery process and the post training reporting process are involved in providing training to an agent. Each process uses an input and produces an output. The overall training flow is initiated when the Administrator provides input and ends when the reporting in the PTR process completes.

The transition from one process in the training flow to another is controlled by a workflow manager not shown in . The workflow manager ensures that when the selection process completes the transition process occurs so as to begin the registration process . Similarly when the registration process completes the workflow manager ensures that transition occurs to begin the scheduling process if appropriate. Similarly when the scheduling process completes the workflow manager ensures that transition to the content delivery process occurs. Similarly the workflow manager ensures the transition to the posting training reporting process occurs. The workflow manager may alter the training flow as will be seen for different types of training. For example in some embodiments the workflow manager will effectively bypass the scheduling process. As noted before the training flow in depicts a CST form of training where training is scheduled to occur at a fixed time.

A variation of the training flow in can be illustrated by initiating the training flow by a different form of input. Specifically instead of the Administrator input initiating the process resulting in manually selecting agents automated agent selection may occur. In this case the automated input comprises agent performance metrics which are automatically generated by analyzing an agent s performance. These metrics may originate from several systems. In one embodiment voice recordings for the agent are recorded analyzed and compared to criteria for the agent. This processing may occur after regular shift hours e.g. early morning and the results may be provided to the learning management system for selecting agents for training. For example an agent s speech recording may be analyzed to detect the presence or absence of certain words or phrases. Specifically a telemarketing sales pitch may be analyzed to ensure that the agent mentioned various features of the product. Failure to mention these features may be a basis for automatically selecting that agent to receive additional product training and initiating the selection process .

In another embodiment agent call processing metrics known as key processing indicators KPIs may be analyzed. These call processing metrics include for example average call holding time answered calls after call work time etc. A particular KPI may suggest that the agent is lacking in a certain skill which can be analyzed and used to again initiate the selection process . The call processing metrics may be generated by various CHS equipment in the call center.

The above variations disclose a training flow that is initiated by system inputs that are processed using rules as opposed to manual inputs. This agent selection mechanism can be used for a form of remedial training where training for agents is initiated by the system to address a deficiency or bolster skills in a certain area. Thus the process in can be used to describe the process flows for either automated selecting of training AST for agents or a conventional manual approach for selecting agents CST based on how the selection process is initiated. Both of these processing flows are examples of fixed time scheduling where the training occurs at a scheduled time for the selected agent.

While the overall training flow in is similar for AST and CST there may be distinctions that occur subsequently in a particular process flow depending on whether the AST or CST training was initiated. For example one distinction between AST and CST may involve a test just prior to or during the content delivery process . This distinction is explained using .

Turning to the process represents one embodiment that may occur by the workflow manager in determining whether the transition should occur. The process picks up with operation by receiving an indication of a training break scheduled for the agent. In operation contextual training information is obtained by retrieving a training context data. Recall that the TCD provides contextual information about the training that is to be provided to the agent.

In operation a test is made to determine if the training is a fixed time type of training. Since it was determined in operation that the training was a form of scheduled training e.g. an indication of a scheduled training break was received then the TCD should confirm that the training is fixed time training. Consequently an indication in operation that the training is not fixed time training would suggest an error. If so then an error message is recorded in the TCD in operation and the process completes.

Assuming that the training is determined in operation to be fixed time training then a test is made in operation to determine how the agent was selected manually or automatically . If the agent was not automatically selected e.g. manually selected then in operation a request is made to the content delivery system CDS to provide the training content to the agent. The TCD in operation is updated to reflect that training was requested to be provided to the agent.

If however in operation the agent was automatically selected then this means that the agent was selected based on a performance metric that was analyzed. The agent may have been selected registered and scheduled for training without the knowledge of the Administrator and independent of staffing levels and calling volumes. A test is then performed in operation to determine if there any conditions that warrant canceling the automatic scheduled agent training. In some embodiments the Administrator s approval may be required before training can be provided. In this embodiment the agent training is automatically scheduled to occur and there may be a number of conditions which warrant postponing the training. For example a high priority call campaign may be under way and requires the agent to handle calls as opposed to be engaged in training at that time. Or a staff shortage condition may exist etc. If conditions warrant cancelling the training then in operation the TCD is updated to reflect this as well otherwise the request for training in operation occurs.

Thus the training flow shown in illustrates two training formats based on fixed time training. While these two flows involve similar processing steps a branch in the workflow may occur for automatic agent scheduling that prohibits the start of the content delivery process. With this example in mind other variations of the processing steps and workflow are described below.

The above discussion involved fixed time training for scheduling an agent to receive e learning based training at a particular time. Another form of fixed time training is a conventional classroom instructional type of format. This format involves the use of classroom facilities and may be referred to as facilities based training. In this form students show up to a facility at a scheduled time to receive their training. Although this does not incorporate all the advantages of e learning content provided to an agent s workstation the concepts and technologies herein can accommodate this conventional form of training.

One depiction of the process flow is shown in . In one embodiment content delivery is human based not e learning based instruction. The selection process registration process and scheduling process are similar to as described above and are not discussed further. However since the content is being delivered by conventional lecture style format the workflow manager effectively bypasses the e learning content delivery process. Or in other words the content delivery process is performed by a human.

This is illustrated by transition in . In this illustration the content is still being delivered but by a human. Thus the workflow is depicted as having a pause which reflects the occurrence of the content being delivered by a human as opposed by an electronic content delivery system. The workflow manager has minimal involvement with the actual provision of the content delivery aside from perhaps indicating to the agent or instructor when the training session should begin and end . The main focus of the workflow manager in this embodiment is to coordinate the selection registration scheduling and post training reporting operations associated with the training. The workflow manager knows from the TCD the appropriate context of the training and that there is no e learning content delivery to coordinate because the training is for facilities based training. The workflow manager may know that human input is required to provide the PST reporting.

In another embodiment the facility may be a classroom housing computers used to provide e learning content to the agents. In this case the training remains facilities based but computer based instruction is still involved and hence the workflow would appear more like than . In another embodiment the facilities based training could involve viewing a live webinar. The students could report to a classroom and view a live webinar which could be viewed from a single screen with audio broadcasted in the room. Alternatively the students could individually view the webinar at separate computers deployed in the classroom. In this case the students could individually view the same live webinar or distinct previously recorded webinars. The workflow manager may be aware of this context and may be configured to accommodate the various forms. If the workflow manager provides e learning to the students it can be configured to ensure that an adequate delay occurs between the beginning of the training session and the delivery of computer based instruction to allow the agents to report to the classroom.

A service flow associated with facilities based training is shown in . In one embodiment the agent is notified in operation of an upcoming scheduled training break. The agent is then paused or suspended from call handling in operation . As will be seen the e learning system may coordinate this action with the CHS. The agent then physically relocates to the training room in operation to receive training. In operation the agent returns at the end of the training break and resumes call handling. In operation the course instructor provides training related information for updating the agent s training profile. The agent may be resumed for call handling when the agent returns to their workstation. Thus even for a facilities based training session there can be a level of service integration by the learning management system.

The above illustrations are examples of fixed time training where training occurs at a scheduled time for the agent. In another embodiment flex time training the training occurs on a non scheduled basis. Specifically the training can occur at the initiation of the agent or a system without regard to a previously scheduled time. When an agent initiates flex time training it is referred to herein as on demand training. When the learning management system initiates the training it is referred to herein as snippet training. The name snippet refers to the frequent relatively short nature of the training session based on the context in which it is provided. Both on demand and snippet training may occur at various times and have the common aspect in that they are not scheduled with respect to starting or stopping at certain times.

There may be different criteria used to initiate the training or termination of flex time training as well as different characteristics of the content being delivered. For example on demand training may allow the same course content to be accessed by an agent that was initially provided to the agent during fixed time training e.g. the agent did not pass the course test . While the fixed time training could be defined as non interruptible the on demand form may be interruptible and accessed when time allows. On the other hand snippet training sessions may be shorter and may be readily interrupted under various conditions. In one embodiment of snippet training the training sessions may be shorter relative to on demand course but the snippet course content is effectively much larger than typical on demand courses. Specifically snippet training may involve a very long course which is continually augmented or changed but the training sessions only allow intermittent and short access. Thus the agent may receive snippet training from a course content which essentially is never completed.

Because flex time training is not scheduled the scheduling process may be bypassed in the training flow. This is reflected in which illustrates a flex time process. In the selection process and the registration process are similar to as described earlier. In one embodiment an agent that is allowed to invoke on demand training is selected using the manual agent identified process. Specifically an Administrator may define criteria indicating that the agent is allowed to invoke on demand learning. The criteria could be as simple e.g. as providing the agent s name to the system during the agent selection process.

An agent that is automatically selected for snippet training may be selected by the system based on automated analysis of agent performance data although it is possible for the Administrator to manually select which agents are allowed to receive snippet training. In this case the agent must be authorized by the Administrator to be selected by the system to receive snippet training.

Returning to the process involving the selection process and the registration process may occur fairly quickly in succession time wise. However after the registration process it may be a while before the content delivery process occurs. For on demand training it is only when and if the agent in process requests training that the content delivery process is initiated and the post training reporting process occurs. Upon completion of the content delivery process the post training reporting process may occur immediately.

An exemplary service flow associated with on demand learning is shown in . This represents one possible embodiment of processing associated with providing on demand training to an agent. In operation the system receives a request from the agent for on demand training. In operation a search of the TCD is performed so that information about the current training context can be identified. If no TCD are found in operation for that agent indicating the agent cannot invoke on demand training then it is reported to the agent in operation that no on demand training courses are available to the agent.

The TCD in operation will indicate that one or more on demand training courses are available for the agent. The TCD is defined when the agent is selected and registered for the training course these information would be in the R ATL at this stage . In operation a test occurs to see whether the TCD indicates that a previously started training course was unfinished. A uncompleted status indicator indicates a prior flex time training session involving the course was interrupted. Consequently the previously started but uncompleted course is resumed in operation .

If there is no TCD with an uncompleted status indicator in operation then a menu of one or more available on demand training courses is presented to the agent in operation . After receiving the agent s course selection in operation the course content is delivered to the agent in operation . If the end of the training session occurs as indicated in operation then another test is performed in operation to determine if the course was completed. If not then in operation the course is bookmarked and the content delivery process completes. A bookmark is an index pointing to a location into the course content indicating where the training course was suspended so that the remaining portion can be presented upon a subsequent on demand training session. If the course is determined to be completed in operation then the appropriate records are updated in the agent training profile and the process completes. If the end of training has not occurred in operation then the process loops to continue delivering content to the agent.

The flow of is one exemplary embodiment for an on demand learning session. Specifically in this embodiment the trigger for the process is initiated in operation by receiving a request from the agent for on demand based training. Further the termination of the training session in operation may also result from an agent initiated action.

The provision of on demand training can be further configured to be dependent on various factors. The Administrator can define various conditions which must be met or which cannot be present in order to act upon an on demand request from an agent. This includes defining specific time windows or flex time training windows when on demand training request can be processed. These can be expressed in different ways including as e.g. time periods during which on demand requests will not be fulfilled or may be fulfilled. An absolute time can be indicated when on demand training request will not be provided e.g. not during any morning shifts but only during the late night shifts . The time could be indicated as a percentage into or from the beginning or ending of the agent s shift. The provision of on demand training could be limited for example to only during the last 25 of time in the agent s shift. Or the rules could limit an agent s on demand training to be limited to 5 or no more than 1 hour shift. A combination of conditions could be defined as well. Thus if 10 of the agents are already engaged in on demand learning other requests may be rejected. Alternatively the provision of on demand training could be limited only during certain campaigns or when the overall call center capacity is below a certain threshold. The training window for on demand flex training does not guarantee training will be provided but defines time periods in which it may be provided. In one embodiment the training window could be set to anytime. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various conditions and limitations beyond those identified herein can be defined for providing on demand training.

Snippet training is another form of training that is flex time based training. This training is further characterized in that the learning management system not a human determines when to initiate the training. In some embodiments the learning management system or the Administrator may determine the course subject matter. This can be distinguished from on demand training where the agent determines when the training is to begin and may also select the training course.

Snippet training may be in a format that is based on relatively short self contained modules of training materials. For example one form of snippet training could be in the form of trivia questions which incorporates an educational aspect and can be frequently interrupted and resumed without a loss of continuity. The trivia aspect can be further coupled with a point system for providing rewards and or incentives to agents.

The process flow for snippet training is similar to except as noted the agent does not determine when and what course is to be provided. The service flow for snippet training can be illustrated in one embodiment in the process flow of . The process presumes in operation that TCD is previously generated which typically occurs when the agent is selected and registered for a training course. As noted earlier there is no scheduling process for this form of flex time training and instead the agent s activity is monitored in operation and a test occurs in operation to determine whether the agent is available for snippet training. If not then the process loops back to operation and continues monitoring the agent s activity.

If the agent is available for snippet training the training context and bookmarks for previously started courses if any are retrieved in operation . In operation the training is delivered to the agent. If the course content is completed in operation then the completion of the training course is reflected in the TCD and the agent profile is updated. In this manner if the snippet training session is reinstituted then this particular course will not be resumed since it was completed and other course content can be selected. In some embodiments the snippet training may comprise a large number of trivia questions so that in effect there is only one training course where questions are selected from. This course content can be continually amended to add new questions. Various techniques can be used for defining bookmarks or avoiding their use all together including e.g. selecting questions at random .

If the delivery of the course content is not completed in operation then another test is made in operation to determine if the agent is still available. The process continues to deliver content in operation and loops back to operation to continue testing whether the course is finished. If the agent is no longer available in operation then the location in the course is bookmarked by updating the TCD and content delivery is terminated.

Snippet training may be provided when the agent is available and the criteria for available can be variously defined. In one embodiment an agent may be available based on how long the agent is the waiting mode e.g. waiting for a call . A threshold may be defined and this value can be determined by querying the CHS or reviewing recent activity logs generated by the CHS. In other embodiments other mechanisms can be used such as monitoring keystroke activity in real time from the agent s computer.

In other embodiments a determination of whether an agent is available is made based on analyzing the status of a group to which the agent belongs to. For example agents having the same skill set may be defined in a certain group. A call center may have more than one group of agents defined. If that group s capacity is such that the call center can adequately handle the call volume with one less agent then one agent from the group can be selected for snippet training. If the group is functioning at capacity then it may not be appropriate to provide snippet training to the one available agent as it may increase the average call waiting time for callers. Further the analysis may be made for agents working only on a particular type of call e.g. for a particular campaign. Thus determining whether an agent is available may involve more than just determining whether the agent or call center is operating at a certain capacity.

Similarly the determination that snippet training should be terminated may be determined based on the overall call volume requiring that particular skill set of that agent or the call volume handled by the group to which the agent is assigned to. It would accomplish little to terminate snippet training to an agent because of increased calls to the call center if that agent were not capable of handling those types of calls.

Similar to the provision of on demand training the delivery of snippet training can be further configured to be dependent on various factors. The Administrator can define various conditions which must be met or which cannot be present in order to deliver snippet training. This includes defined training time windows which can be expressed in different ways. An absolute time can be indicated when e.g. snippet training cannot be provided e.g. not during any morning shifts but only during the late night shifts . The time could be indicated as a percentage into or from the boundaries of the agent s shift. For example only provide snippet training during the last 25 of time in the agent s shift. A combination of conditions could be defined as well. Snippet training could be limited to being provided only during certain campaigns or when the overall call center capacity is below a certain threshold. The training window indicates time periods when training may potentially occur not that it is required to occur. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various conditions and limitations for providing snippet training can be defined.

Bookmarking refers to management of an index into the course content indicating the point where content was last delivered to an agent. Bookmarking allows computer based course content to be interrupted. Interruptions can occur for various reasons including limited duration of training sessions change in work load circumstances or that the agent merely needs a break from training content delivery. Bookmarking provides a mechanism to interrupt a training session and easily return the agent to the location at which content delivery was interrupted. Thus the ability to bookmark is often used to facilitate interruption of a training session to minimize wasted time associated with starting a training session again from the beginning.

With respect to the process flow previously described the process of bookmarking can be illustrated with . illustrates the process flow for a fixed time training flow note the presence of the scheduling process in the training flow . The agent is selected registered and scheduled as described previously. The content delivery process is initiated but during the training session the process is suspended. Process is shown nevertheless as continuing to the post training reporting process even though the content delivery process is not completed. This is because the post training reporting process may be used to report not only completed training sessions but incomplete training sessions. Whenever the training session is stopped it is not necessarily apparent at that time whether the interruption is merely temporary e.g. a mini break by the agent during the training session or whether the training session will be resumed. Thus the post training reporting process is invoked at the cessation of content delivery and reports that the training commenced but was not completed. This allows a bookmark to be established which can be resumed if the training session resumes.

The resumption of the training course is depicted in process flow . The agent may have e.g. decided to resume content delivery after a break in the training session. The remaining course content is delivered and the post training reporting process is again invoked but this time to report the completion of the training content delivery for the agent.

The training context data comprises information used to determine a training context. The training context allows the appropriate work flow to occur. Depending on the features defined in an embodiment of an agent based training system the information stored in the TCD may vary. Recall that the genesis of the TCD is in the ATL generated by the selection process and one embodiment is shown in . This embodiment is not intended to be limiting as different structures may be defined. While the TCD comprises information used in the provision of training the TCD typically does not include the training content itself of the training course. Further some information in the TCD may duplicate information found in meta data associated with the training course. For example the training course content may have meta data indicating the course duration which may also be indicated in the TCD. As it will be seen in some embodiments the meta data of the training content may be provided by a third party content provider and may not be readily available to the agent based training system hence it may be duplicated in the TCD.

The TCD can be indexed in various ways. In one embodiment there is a record for each course associated with each agent. Thus if ten agents are to receive the same course content then there would be ten ATL records. If an agent were to receive six different training courses then again there would be six different records. In one embodiment the provision of any training course regardless of the training format is uniquely associated with an ATL record. Thus even a facilities based lecture style training session may have one or more ATL records when using the agent based training system to schedule the training session.

Turning to the set of ATL records depicts four records comprising TCD for courses taken by the same agent. Each ATL record can be indicated by a column and each comprising a series of data elements. The function and utility of the ATL record can be illustrated by explaining each of these records and their respective data elements.

The first row of the table includes classifications e.g. Parameter Fixed Time Training Conventionally Scheduled Training etc. which are aids used to explain the categories of the examples. These values are not part of the record. The record comprises a series of data elements numbered 1 13. The first record shown in column illustrates one potential format for a fixed time training session which can also be characterized as a conventionally scheduled training session. In other words this TCD reflects a course scheduled by an Administrator for that agent at a specific time. This value is reflected in the third data element CST .

The Course ID data element the first data element indicates the name or identifier of the training course. In this embodiment for column it is Beginning Skills 101 but could also be a numerical identifier. The next data element Agent Identifier indicates the name of the agent. These values are determined during the agent selection process which may be provided by the Administrator during agent selection. During the agent selection process the Administrator may be prompted for these values which are stored in the appropriate record. In this embodiment Jane Doe is to receive training for the course entitled Beginning Skills 101. 

The Training Format data element the third data element indicates the training format. Choices may include conventional automatic snippet and on demand . These values are shorthand indications for the characteristics of the training conventional is shorthand for conventionally scheduled training which refers to fixed time training that is scheduled by an Administrator. This value is typically determined during the agent selection process. Automatic is shorthand for automatically scheduled training which is fixed time training scheduled by the system. Snippet and on demand indicate snippet and on demand training which are flex time training formats which are initiated by the system and an agent respectively.

The Duration data element indicates the time duration of course which is indicated for this record as 30 min. This value may be copied from meta data which is stored with the course data or which may be set by an Administrator when defining the course. This may be the actual duration of the content delivery time or may be the time necessary to be allocated to the training session to deliver the content.

The Scheduled Date Time data element indicates the scheduled date time of the course. In this embodiment Jane Doe is scheduled to receive the course content on Jul. 12 2012 at 2 00 p.m. This value may be determined at different times. In one embodiment the training may be determined by the Administrator well in advance of the work schedule for an agent. For example the Administrator may know that a new campaign will be offered in two months and that agent training will be required the week before it begins. In this case the date or date time of the training is known at the time the agent is selected. In another embodiment the date of training is not indicated and will be determined taking into account the agent s work schedule. Regardless of when and how the training time is determined it is determined at some point prior to the actual occurrence of the training and indicated in the TCD. Note that if the training is flex time then there is no scheduled date time which can be indicated by N.A. . Because the training format is CST there should be a scheduled data time value determined at some point.

The Course Completion Date indicates the latest date when the course should be completed. For fixed time training the completion date may be the same day on which training is provided. This data element is also useful for flex time training as will be seen. Specifically for flex time training this indicates a date by when the training must be completed or should be provided. For flex time training that may be perpetually available this value may be set to a long off future value.

The Facilities Based data element indicates if training is based in a training facility e.g. a classroom. For the first record which is column this value is set to no so training is not based in a particular facility or location. If the value is set to no the training is presumed in this embodiment to be e learning based training occurring at the agent s workstation. Conversely if training does occur at a given facility e.g. the value is set to yes then the training will not be provided at the agent s workstation but at a facility. It is possible that the training in the facility may or may not be computer based. The concepts and technologies disclosed herein can be used to deliver e learning content to computers in a classroom.

The Course Series Indicator data element indicates whether there are multiple modules in a course or multiple courses associated in a curriculum. In the first record the value 1 of 1 indicates that this is a stand alone course. A value of e.g. 2 of 2 would indicate in one embodiment that this is the second of a two part course or the second of two modules. This value may be used to determine if training should automatically continue with the next module or course in a series. Thus in an on demand context after completing a first course and there is another request for training then the training may continue with the second course. In a fixed time context the modules may be presented in order during the training session. Other data structures can be used for indicating a course hierarchy as required. This data element can be further used to determine if all the courses in a curriculum have been taken which can be used to determine that the agent has completed a course of study. Further information may be provided in the record to identify a link or identifier to the subsequent courses. Thus the data structure could be used to link a series of records together in a curriculum.

The Bookmarkable data element indicator is used to indicate whether the course can be interrupted and resumed e.g. bookmarked. Some courses may be structured so that they cannot be interrupted and if so then the course is reported as not completed and must be restarted from the beginning. Other embodiments may allow courses to be interrupted and resumed after a break. In the first record the Bookmarkable indication is set as yes indicating this course in this training session can be interrupted. The actual bookmark value indicating where a bookmark is in the course content may be stored in the content itself or as another data element in the TCD.

The Completion Status data element indicates whether the course has been completed. Upon completion of the course the Post Training Reporting Process will set this data element value to completed. In certain embodiments a test score may be included in the TCD or linked to along with an indication of whether the course was passed or failed. The post training reporting process may record this information in the agent training profile. As noted previously the TCD records can be viewed in one embodiment as transient information used to provide training courses and are differentiated from information that is stored for long term reference purposes referred to as agent training data. Thus the completion status may be copied into the agent training data to report that the agent completed training of the indicated course. Other embodiments may also store in the agent training profile the date the course was taken the test score passing indicator etc.

The Start Status data element indicates whether the course has been started. When the TCD is initially generated this value is usually set to no. Only when the agent has started the course is this value set to yes. A yes value does not necessarily mean that the course was completed. This value is useful in flex time training situations since flex time training sessions may be shorter and interruptible. If set to yes and the training course has not completed then this suggests a bookmark was created.

The Training Scheduled By data element indicates the source that initiated the training flow. This value is largely used to differentiate between fixed time training that is the result of Administrator input e.g. manual agent selection or the learning management system e.g. automatic agent selection . If the former then the Administrator identifier may be indicated for tracking purposes. This value may be used by the learning management system to determine whether to pre empt training for an agent scheduled based on current circumstances. For example training where the agent was automatically scheduled may be terminated or postponed if call volume load increases at the time of the training session and requires all available agents in the call center to handle the call volume.

The Training Format for Remaining Portion data element indicates how an unfinished portion of the training course may be delivered. Specifically a training course maybe associated with an agent that is to be provided in one training format but if uncompleted it may be provided in another training format. In this embodiment Jane Doe is to receive Beginning Skills 101 on the scheduled date time in a conventionally scheduled fixed time training format . However if the course is not completed recall that the training session in this record can be bookmarked then the remaining portion of the course could be accessed by the agent on an on demand basis. In other embodiments the remaining portion of the course might require rescheduling of the course in a fixed time training format.

The other examples of the training context data in the other records namely in columns illustrate other training embodiments. These will not be discussed in detail but a number of the salient distinguishing aspects are noted below. In the second record the Training Format is indicated as automatic for automatically scheduled training . This means that the agent was selected for training by the learning management system. Similarly any unfinished remaining portion of the course is also indicated as being offered on an Automatic training format. It is noted that the course is for the follow up course Beginning Skills 102 and it is scheduled two days after Jane Doe s initial Beginning Skills 101 course.

The third record indicates Training Format as snippet which means training content delivery may be initiated by the system when conditions allow. Snippet training is often indicated as Bookmarkable allowing the course to be resumed when conditions allow. Further any unfinished content can be completed in a snippet training format. Some snippet training courses can comprises very large content which essentially cannot be completed. For example a snippet training course may have 1000 trivia questions which are constantly being updated or augmented so that the training is never completed. In other words snippet training can always be provided.

The fourth record is an On demand training format which indicates the agent may request the training course at their convenience. The course can be selected up to the scheduled completion date Jul. 12 2012 . After this point the course may not be shown as it is unavailable. In other embodiments the date could be set far out so that the course is always available. The course is Bookmarkable and since the course has been started but not completed a bookmark should exist for this course so that when the agent resumes training the course is resumed at the previous point. The agent can resume the remaining course in an on demand type of training format.

Certain combinations of data element values may not be allowed or make not be commonly used. For example a course cannot be indicated both as completed and not started. In another example it may be uncommon to allows an on demand training course to be bookmarked but then only provide the remaining training content in a fixed time manner. This would mean an agent could initiate training at will for a course but if interrupted then the remaining portion of the course would have to be scheduled. However even uncommonly used combinations are within the scope of the concepts and technologies presented herein and may have applications not readily observed.

Other combinations of data elements and values may be present and defined to indicate other contextual training information. For example as indicated previously a number of conditions could be defined to limit when flex time training is provided. Additional data elements could be defined for each of these conditions to provide additional customization specifying when the flex time training is to occur. For example data elements could be defined when on demand agent training is not allowed for an agent or when snippet training may be provided. These may be referred to as flex time training windows as they define time periods when flex time training may be provided e.g. when the agent is eligible for receiving training though it is not guaranteed that training will be provided during a training window. Thus a novice agent may be prohibited from accessing training content on demand whereas a senior agent may be allowed to within certain parameters. Since there are a variety of conditions that could be defined to delimit a flex time training window the data elements in are only illustrative of one set of training contextual data that could be defined.

Other data elements could be defined to indicate whether a course has a curriculum status namely indicating whether the course is mandatory optional or remedial. This may facilitate scheduling aspects. For example all agents may be scheduled to receive mandatory training whereas optional courses may be provided on demand. Or a priority for scheduling may be based on whether courses are mandatory optional or remedial. Remedial training may be provided that is provided to reemphasize certain training aspects and its provision may occur only in certain circumstances such as via a snippet training format.

The above describes the training process flow and various training formats and a record structure for indicating a training context. One embodiment of a learning management system for providing these flows and training formats is described in . This architecture is only one possible embodiment as one skilled in the art will recognize that various functions illustrated can be implemented in different ways without departing from the concepts and technologies disclosed herein.

Turning to the learning management system LMS can broadly refer to the components shown which may variously include modules systems and or elements that interact and are used to accomplish delivery of training content as described herein. The e learning system is the platform that executes an e learning module which in turn comprises a set of modules executing in one or more computing systems. The e learning module is used to accomplish the training flow and coordination among other call center components that may be involved.

Before delving into the e learning module some of the other components are discussed first. The call handler system refers to the various call processing components in that may be present in a call center which may include the ACD dialer CTI and potentially other components. Because not all call centers may have each of these call handling components the call handling system CHS broadly refers to the components in that are involved in handling calls which can vary in each embodiment. The CHS may maintain a database storing agent skill level information which can be used with skills based routing of calls to an agent at a workstation .

The CHS may have an interface to a WFM that schedules agents for working call campaigns in the call center. The WFM may maintain a database of agent work schedule information and which may store work schedules for each of the agents. The WFM may provide notifications of the work schedule and training session to the agent via the agent workstation over an interface and or over a mobile device used by the agent. The notifications may inform the agent of an upcoming lunch break work break or other activity such as a training session. The WFM may also inform the CHS using interface when the agent s training session actually starts and ends. In this case the WFM also identifies the agent to the CHS. This allows the CHS to suspend and resume call routing to the agent workstation as appropriate. This avoids the agent from having to manually suspend and resume call processing. Consequently when the agent is in a training session or other break the CHS is aware of the agent s status and suspends offering calls to the agent.

The LMS does not require that each embodiment necessarily include each of the components shown in . In some embodiments only a subset of the components may be present. For example the CHS may be not integrated with the LSM which can be modeled as having the CHS effectively absent. In this embodiment the LMS comprises the e learning system the WFM and the CDS. The e learning system coordinates with the WFM and CDS to providing training content to the agents but there is no integration with the CHS. Thus agents can be scheduled for training and receive content via their workstation but the CHS is not apprised or updated in regard to the agent s training as completely as it could be otherwise. Thus even if the CHS is not integrated with the e learning system the disclosed LMS can be deployed in a call center. In other embodiments the LMS can be deployed in full or in part as a hosted service in a cloud. The hosted LMS can interact and coordinate with various premise based WFMs and or CDS. Various other combinations of components may exist in other embodiments.

The WFM may also provide a copy of the notifications of scheduled agent training session activities over interface to the e learning module. Specifically the WFM notifies the e learning module when a specific agent is to begin or end a training session. The e learning module does not require being informed when the agent is on a work break or lunch break . The WFM only provides notifications for fixed time training sessions not for flex time activities. Indeed the WFM may not even be aware of flex time training sessions involving the agent in all embodiments. Consequently the WFM is aware of fixed time training sessions for an agent and will inform the e learning module when a training session is to begin or end. The remaining coordination of training session activities is performed by the e learning module .

The e learning module itself typically does not deliver the actual training content to the agent but requests the content delivery system CDS to provide the content to the agent. Thus the e learning module instructs the CDS to deliver or terminate specific course content to an agent. This is accomplished via an interface between the e learning module and the CDS . The CDS may be adapted to interface with the e learning module by incorporating an e learning interface module . This allows streaming content delivery systems to be adapted for delivery of training content. The CDS may in turn access a database of training content which is streamed or otherwise presented to the agent at their workstation computer.

In various embodiments the CDS and training content database may be operated by a third party service provider e.g. by an entity that does not operate or control the e learning module WFM and or CHS . Thus the interface may be configured to accommodate identification of a third party CDS provider incorporate appropriate security mechanisms and accommodate invoicing and payment procedures. Further details about accommodating third party CDS providers are discussed further below.

The e learning module may also have interfaces into the CHS the agent skill level database and the agent workstation . The interface with the CHS is to receive indications of the agent s status as well as call volume indicators and other data. The CHS can provide data indicating how busy the call center is as well as a specific agent or a group of agents. If that agent is not busy the e learning module can provide snippet training to the agent. If the call volume directed for a group of agents increases then the e learning module can cease snippet training to that agent.

The interface between the e learning module and agent skill level database allows the e learning module to update an agent s skill level once an agent has completed the appropriate training courses. Updating the agent skill level allows the CHS to update any skills based routing after an agent has acquired new skills In this embodiment the agent skill level database is distinct from the agent training profile database .

Finally the interface between the e learning module and the workstation allows the e learning module to provide notifications to the agent regarding upcoming training sessions and perform other administrative functions involving the agent. This interface can be used by the agent to request for example on demand training from the e learning module . The notifications can be provided on the agent s computer and or to a smart phone used by the agent. The notifications may also inform the agent of successfully completing a course or curriculum or achieving a higher skill level.

In some embodiment the interface used by the agent to access on demand learning may be from a different computer. Specifically a call center agent may use their workstation at the call center to request on demand training but may also request on demand training when at home during their off days. In this case the interface may incorporate additional security mechanisms to allow an agent to log on for on demand training at another computer.

The e learning module may also incorporate an interface to receive agent performance metrics. These metrics could be the result of agent call analysis using voice analytics or call handling metrics. These metrics could be provided by the CHS or quality assurance systems. To the extent that these metrics are received from the CHS then interface could be used. The data received over this interface is used to select agents for training. The e learning modules may incorporate various rules and thresholds used to analyze the agent performance metrics data in order to select agents for training.

Another interface that the e learning module may incorporate is the manual agent selection interface . This interface may be used for interacting with an Administrator for selection of agents for training. This may be based on a GUI interface used to access an agent selection tool to identify agents to be trained. In some embodiments the manual agent selection interface is present whereas the agent performance metrics interface may be absent.

The e learning module may also incorporate an interface to an agent training profile database . The agent training profile stores agent training related data that is maintained on a long term or permanent basis. For example the indication of training courses completed by an agent the test results and certifications of skill levels may be maintained in the agent training profile database . Other information including some which is found in the TCD may not be retained. For example information such as training course schedule times may warrant retention after training has occurred although some embodiments may retain such records for a period of time after training. In some embodiments the agent training profile database may be stored in the same physical storage unit as the agent work schedule database and in some embodiments both of these databases may be implemented with the WFM .

The diagrammatic representation of the system in offers the benefit of and addresses the corresponding problem of adapting and reusing existing call center components as much as possible for use in a learning management system. This minimizes duplication of components to an extent and thus minimizes costs. The system architecture of can be implemented using a variety of physical components and arrangements. Thus the logical representation of the components in can be implemented on a single processing system a distributed processing system or other configurations known in the art. Thus it is possible that all the databases shown in could be stored in one file on one storage system or as separate data structures in separate storage systems.

The architecture of the e learning module is further illustrated in . The e learning module can be implemented in various ways and in one embodiment it may be incorporated into the WFM as a module executing in the WFM platform. In other embodiments the e learning module could be implemented using a separate computing platform the e learning system . Thus the illustration of the e learning module in as being separate from the WFM is for illustration purposes only and does not imply any implementation requirements or limitations. To accommodate these various implementation options reference is generally made to the e learning module as opposed to the system platform it executes one.

In one embodiment the e learning module comprises a number of other modules performing various functions and operations. Again various implementations may use a greater or fewer number of modules and or allocate various functions and operations differently between the modules where feasible. In one embodiment the modules correspond to the processes in the training flow previously discussed in conjunction with specifically the agent selection process the registration process the scheduling process the content delivery process and the post training reporting process.

The selection process is associated with two modules the automated agent selection module and or the manual agent selection module . In other embodiments only a single module may exist e.g. the manual agent selection module but for illustration purposes two distinct modules are described. These two agent selection modules are both involved in selecting one or more agents to be trained and may incorporate various rules. Thus these modules select agents in a different manner from each other but share many common aspects. For example the automatic agent selection module may receive inputs comprising agent performance metrics and agent voice analytic results and apply rules to select agents requiring training based on the received metrics. The manual agent selection interface may incorporate various agent selection tools aiding an Administrator in selection of agents. Both modules may interact with a database the agent training list database . This database stores the ATL including the TCD that is generated by the agent selection modules and which may be accessed and or updated by other modules during the training flow. These modules may retrieve a master list of agents from the WFM using the aforementioned interface .

The registration module performs the functions of the registration process and may utilize and or update the ATL and TCD stored in the agent training list database generated by one of the agent selection modules or . The registration module may also access information about training courses stored in a training management module . The training management module may contain course related data including course prerequisites as well as defines rules for how registration may be governed. A result of the registration module completing is that the ATL is further updated to create the R ATL.

Once the registration module completes registration the scheduling module similarly may access and or update the ATL in the agent training list database to schedule agents for the course. The interface to the content delivery system module provides the necessary interface to the CDS system . Finally the post training reporting module reports the training results and updates the agent training profile database .

The workflow manager controls which modules are invoked. Thus after completion of the selection process by one of the agent selection modules the workflow manager will then invoke the registration module to perform the registration process. Next the workflow manager may invoke the scheduling module to perform the scheduling process. The workflow manager may also invoke the interface to the content delivery system module to control the CDS delivering the training content. Finally the workflow manager may invoke the port training reporting module to accomplish the post training reporting process.

The workflow manager may access the TCD in the ATL database to analyze the training context data to determine the proper workflow. As will be seen the workflow manager may receive various triggering events that it processes to determine whether content delivery process should begin. Accessing the ATL database may be consulted to determine if the appropriate conditions have been met. In one embodiment the initiation of the overall training flow may be started by one of the agent selection modules or and the remaining portion of the training flow is controlled by the workflow manager. In another embodiment the overall training process can be initiated by the workflow manager which then invokes one of the agent selection modules or .

Finally the administration tools provide an interface to the Administrator to define or modify various controls and parameters associated with system configuration. This may also allow the Administrator to access the training management module for setting reviewing and configuring the e learning module. Thus the interface can be used to define the available courses course prerequisites edit the TCD records define rules associated with selection or registration indicate course curriculums define passing scores for a course etc. The interface and the administrator tools can also be used to review which agents have taken courses average scores for a course edit values etc.

Although only the Administrator is shown as being able to access interface in certain functions of the interface or a separate interface may be available for agents to access. This allows the agents to review which courses they have taken or are available to take when the agent is scheduled to take a course review the curriculum or registered courses request scheduling for a course etc. The interfaces shown in may be in one embodiment web based so that either a user at a computer using a conventional web browser or another computer using an appropriately defined application programming interface can interact with the e learning module as required.

The above description is a high level overview of one embodiment of the learning management system including the e learning system executing the e learning module . The various modules within the e learning module could be implemented in various call center components. In one embodiment the e learning module is executed in the WFM so that the WFM is effectively also the e learning system . For example the interface module may actually comprise further sub modules for interfacing with various other components. The architecture disclosed in can be embodied and implemented in various configurations without departing from the spirit of the concept and technologies disclosed herein. Further details about the modules within the e learning module are discussed below.

The manual agent selection module may be used by an Administrator to select agents for training and to indicate the training courses agents are to receive. There may be various forms of agent selection tools provided to the Administrator for this purpose. In one embodiment a GUI interface or wizard application can be provided by the manual agent selection module allowing the Administrator to select agents or indicate criteria for identifying agents for training. In some embodiments a structured query language or syntax can be defined allowing the Administrator to select agents by typing in a command line. Other tools for selecting agents may allow the Administrator to select and filter agents by various criteria including by seniority employee type full time part time seasonal pay level contract number skill set shift days of week etc.

The Administrator may indicate that agents are to be scheduled well in advance of normal work shift schedules. In such instances the Administrator may indicate a time or date on which or by when training should be scheduled to occur. In other words the training session is scheduled far out enough that the agent s work schedule when subsequently generated will accommodate the agent s scheduled training session. This may be referred to as the training schedule leading the work schedule. In other embodiments a work schedule may already exist for the indicated agents and the training schedule is generated taking into account the existing agent s work schedule. In this case the work schedule is said to lead the training schedule.

If the work schedule leads the training then various criteria may be solicited from the Administrator to define when or how the training schedule should be incorporated into the agent s work schedule. For example if the work schedule is already determined but training is a priority the system can schedule agent training on a priority basis without deference to the work schedule or call volumes. On the other hand the Administrator may indicate that training should be incorporated into the work schedule at the lowest anticipated call volume. In this case the training will be incorporated taking into account the anticipated call volumes during the agent s work schedule. The Administrator could further define certain days that training should be scheduled e.g. on a day having historically low call volumes . In some embodiments the Administrator can manually schedule the agents by indicating the training session times for each agent. Various other scenarios may be defined for incorporating the training into the work schedule.

If the training schedule leads the work schedule then in one embodiment the Administrator selects the particular times or days on which training is to occur. This is quite often the case for facilities based fixed time training scheduling. In this embodiment the Administrator may assign a group of agents for training on a certain date time that coincides with the facility reservation. Thus the form of the user interface provided to the Administrator via the manual agent selection module may vary based on the circumstances e.g. whether the work schedule leads or the training schedule leads. The user interface may as a first determination during the process solicit input from the Administrator as to which schedule leads the other. If the training is flex time then another form of user interface may be appropriate.

As evident there are a number of procedures and process flows that can be associated with the manual agent selection module . One high level embodiment is illustrated in . In this figure the process begins with receiving and processing a log on from the Administrator in operation that signifies initiating the training process. A master set of agents is retrieved from which the agents will be selected for training in operation . The master list may be a list of all the employees that are employed in the call center. Agents that are not on the master list cannot then be selected to be included in an ATL.

In operation the manual agent selection module receives inputs from the Administrator indicating the courses involved in the training. This may be provided via drop down menus or other appropriate human interface mechanisms. Similarly in operation the module receives inputs from the Administrator indicating criteria for selecting agents from the master agent list. The criteria could be indicated using a command language a selection of indicators presented on a GUI or a list of agent names. The type of interface associated with operation may vary in different embodiments and may involve a number of other operations and interactions. Any number of database interface search tools could be used.

After the courses and agents have been selected and associated with each other the manual agent selection module then generates in operation the SEL ATL and appropriate TCD. The SEL ATL may be a list of agents and associated training courses. The SEL ATL could be formatted to identify a training course and all the agents to be trained for that course. The SEL ATL may be segmented so that groups of agents are segmented based on priority for a given course course size or some other criteria. For example a list of 30 agents may be segmented into 3 groups of 10 and each group is associated with the same training course. Alternatively the SEL ATL may represent a group of 10 agents that are to be trained in 3 consecutive weeks of training or 3 groups of 10 agents for facilities based training etc.

The manual agent selection module also generates an initial version of a TCD. The TCD indicates data about the training context and may include the data elements previously discussed in conjunction with an exemplary TCD format as well as other data elements not shown in . To the extent that the Administrator provides input using the agent selection module for defining these data elements the manual agent selection module provides an appropriate interface for allowing the Administrator define these data elements. The administration tool may provide another means to edit modify or otherwise define these data elements.

After the SEL ATL is generated the manual agent selection module then notifies the workflow manager in operation . At this point the workflow manager controls the invocation of the subsequent modules. Thus while the training flow is initiated by the agent selection module either or the workflow manager controls the remaining portion of the training flow. In other embodiments the workflow manager could periodically poll the ATL database to determine that an ATL was generated by an agent selection module. The manual agent selection module may continuously check for Administrator input for initiating another instance of the training flow as multiple training flows can occur. Thus an Administrator could initiate a training flow for one course involving a group of agents and then initiate another training flow for another course.

In operation rules are applied in processing the agent performance related metrics to determine which of the agents are to be selected for training. The criteria may be based on analyzing performance data in light of a threshold level and selecting agents with low performance metrics. Various algorithms and process flows could be defined for identifying the agents to be trained. The rules could be defined for the context of a particular outbound campaign.

Once the agents are selected and the appropriate training courses have been identified then in operation the SEL ATL is generated along with the TCD. That the agent placed on an ATL occurred by the automatic agent training module is noted in the TCD so that the learning management system is able to differentiate between an agent selected by the automatic agent selection process and an agent selected by the manual agent selection process. As was previously noted the learning management system may determine the training flow based on how the agent was selected for training in light of conditions in the call center.

After the ATL and TCD are generated the automatic agent selection module may inform the workflow manager in operation . The workflow manager may then invoke other modules to complete the training flow. The ATL generated by either type of agent selection processing module identifies the agents and courses and the next step is registering these agents for the course is required. Normally the registration module would then be invoked to perform this process.

The registration process module registers the selected agents identified in the ATL for the indicated courses. The registration process module ensures in part that the requirements and rules required to register the agent for a course are met. In one embodiment the registration process module is invoked by the workflow manager after completion of the agent selection process by one of the agent selection modules. One process flow for the registration process module is shown in .

In the process begins with retrieving the appropriate record from the SEL ATL in operation . The process involves an overall looping process where each record in the ATL is processed. For the initial pass the initial record is retrieved. It is assumed for purposes of illustration that each course and or agent to be trained is indicated in a distinct record. After the initial or next record is retrieved then in operation the course associated with the agent is determined.

In operation a determination is made to see if the agent can be registered for the indicated course. The exact parameters used to determine the outcome of this test can vary with each embodiment and there may be a number of tests involved.

The determination of whether the agent can be registered may involve accessing two types of data stored in the training management module . The first type is course related data CRD . CRD includes data associated with a particular course that may be used to determine whether registration can occur. The CRD may contain other course data used for other operations during the training flow. Exemplary data may include 

The second form of data that may be used to determine whether an agent can be registered are training management rules. These are rules which may be defined for the call center agent group or some for other context that define additional criteria for agent registration. There may be any number of rules that can be defined that must be met in order to register an agent. These can be set using the administrator interface previously mentioned. Some examples include 

If it is determined that in operation that registration cannot proceed then an error is generated and recorded in the TCD. The process continues at operation where a determination is made whether any additional records are to be processed.

If the agent can be registered then in operation the agent is registered. In one embodiment registration can be indicated by appropriately updating the TCD to record information associated with agent registration in operation . Course related data such as the number of agents current registered in the course may also be updated.

In operation a test is performed to see if all records have been processed. If not then the process reiterates and selects the next record by returning to operation . Otherwise once the processing is complete then in operation the workflow manager is informed that registration processing is completed. In other embodiments the workflow manager may periodically poll the ATL or TCD to determine whether a change in the training flow is appropriate. In some embodiments the registration processing module can be integrated or incorporated into the agent selection processing module.

Once the registration module has updated the TCD the ATL may be referred to as a registered ATL R ATL . The registration process can process a multitude of records associated with an ATL and may be processing multiples ATLs.

The scheduling module schedules the agents identified in the R ATL for the courses indicated. This presumes that the agents are registered for fixed time training. In one embodiment the scheduling process is not performed by the scheduling module itself but coordinated by the scheduling module. In one embodiment the scheduling module may invoke a scheduling engine residing in a WFM that is used for scheduling agents for call center shifts. Thus the scheduling engine in the WFM is reused for scheduling agent training. This facilitates integrating the agent s work and training schedules.

Recall that the scheduling process may not be involved in every training flow. Specifically flex time training courses do not involve course scheduling. Assuming that fixed time training is involved the process flow as shown in may occur. The process begins with the scheduling module retrieving the R ATL along providing the associated TCD information in operation . Since not all agents will be involved in fixed time scheduling the scheduling module extracts only those agents in the R ATL involved in fixed time training in operation that are to be scheduled. Once the agents associated with fixed time training are identified the scheduling module then provides a set of records to the WFM module in operation for the agents requiring scheduling thereby requesting the WFM to actually schedule the agents. In operation the scheduling module receives a scheduling complete indicator from the WFM indicating that the agents have been scheduled.

The actual scheduled times for each training course may be stored in the WFM in conjunction with the agent s work schedule. The scheduled times may also be reflected in the TCD for the agent. In other embodiments a flag may indicate in the TCD that scheduling has occurred and the TCD has a link to the actual training schedule information in the WFM. Thus it is not necessary in all embodiments that the scheduling module actually receive the schedule itself from the WFM. As noted the scheduling module does update the TCD to reflect scheduling has occurred since the WFM may not be aware of the TCD structure. In some embodiments the WFM may store and indicate the training course scheduled for the training session in the agent s schedule. In some embodiments the WFM can store this information as plain text since the WFM does not need to recognize the training course indicated for the agent at the given time. Once the TCD is updated in operation the schedule module in operation informs the workforce manager that scheduling is complete.

The interface module I F module interfaces the e learning module with the content delivery system and other components to coordinate delivery of training content to the agent. In many embodiments the I F module itself does not deliver content but coordinates with other systems or components that deliver actually deliver the content such as the CDS. The CDS itself may be an available training system adapted to interface and coordinate content delivery with the e learning module.

The I F module interfaces not only with the CDS but with other components as will be seen. As will be seen some of the functionality involved between the I F module and the workflow manager can be allocated differently. In one embodiment further described herein the I F module operates to convey and convert messages from one format to another so that the workflow manager and or other modules can effectively communicate with the CDS CHS WFM and agent workstation.

The process flow associated with the I F module is dependent on the particular training format to be provided by the learning management system. The workflow manager is aware of the training format via the TCD and informs the I F module. Alternatively the I F module may determine this itself by analyzing the TCD. The I F module then appropriately interfaces with the CDS and other call center components as appropriate to achieve the content delivery. Specifically the I F module may interface with the WFM CDS agent s workstation and CHS as shown by process in . Each of these interfaces are discussed individually as WFM interactions CDS interactions agent workstation interactions and CHS interactions .

Interactions involving the I F module may notify the workflow manager after completion of an interaction in operation and may receive further invocations from the workflow manager. These aspects will become evident in reviewing the various types of interactions identified above.

The I F module may interact with the WFM in part by receiving various notifications pertaining to the beginning or ending of an upcoming training session and provide a corresponding command to the CDS to begin or terminate training content delivery. The process is shown in and begins with the I F module receiving from the WFM a notification of an upcoming training session for an indicated agent over interface . The WFM may or may not be necessarily aware of the specific training course that an agent has been scheduled for but the WFM is aware of the times that the agent is scheduled for fixed time training.

The I F module receives the notification from the WFM in operation and retrieves a TCD associated with the agent this assumes there is a TCD associated with the agent the absence of a TCD suggests an error condition . An examination of the TCD will indicate whether the agent is registered for fixed time training. If the agent is not associated with fixed time training e.g. flex time training as tested in operation then the process returns in operation back to process . This would be an error condition since if the WFM has scheduled a training session and issued a training session notification then there should be a TCD indicating the fixed time training session.

If the agent is registered for fixed time training in operation the TCD will indicate the associated course that is to be taken and other relevant contextual information about the training. As result processing proceeds to operation .

In operation the I F module informs the CDS to prepare for the delivery of the indicated content to the indicated agent. In some embodiments the WFM may issue an early indication notification before an upcoming training break e.g. 5 minutes before followed by a notification of the actual start of the training break. If so then in one embodiment the I F module may indicate a corresponding notification to the CDS.

In operation the I F module receives from the WFM the notification of the start of the training session and in response notifies the CDS in operation to begin delivery of the course content to the indicated agent. In some embodiments the early notification of an upcoming break is not provided by the WFM and only the actual start of the training break is indicated by the WFM. A similar early actual notification process may occur when the training break is about to end or actually is ending. Specifically the I F module may send a corresponding command for ending content delivery to the CDS.

The interactions between the I F module and the CDS dovetail with the interactions between the I F module and the WFM. Specifically the I F module interactions with the CDS may mirror the indications of the early notification of an upcoming training session and the actual notification of the beginning of the training session. The process flow of details these interactions.

In operation a notification is provided to the CDS by the I F module of an upcoming training break for an agent. This is sent in response to receiving the notification from the WFM. In operation a test is determined if confirmation is received from the CDS. If so then after receiving an indication of the actual start of the training break from the WFM a notification is sent to the CDS in operation of the beginning of the training session to provide the training content. The TCD is updated to reflect that training was initiated for the indicated course. If in either operation a confirmation is not received by the I F module from the CDS an error notification may be made in operation to the workflow manager.

The I F module may also interact with the agent directly via the agent workstation . In one embodiment the I F module may relay indications to the agent at the workstation regarding the early notification or actual notification of the beginning of a fixed time training session.

In other embodiments the I F module may be involved with interactions associated with flex time training that is initiated by the agent. Specifically in one embodiment the I F module receives requests for on demand training originating from the agent as shown in . In flex time training initiated by the agent there are no notifications sent to the agent about a scheduled training session.

In the process typically involves receiving either a request from the agent to begin on demand training in operation or a request from the agent to end on demand training in operation . If a request for on demand training is received in operation then in operation the TCD associated with that agent is retrieved. It is presumed that the agent has been registered for receiving on demand courses if not the process would generate an error and return which is not shown in . The TCD indicates which course s the agent may receive in what training format. Assuming the agent is registered for the requested course a notification is provided to the CDS to begin delivery of the requested training content in operation . In operation a confirmation is received that the CDS is providing the content and the TCD is updated appropriately in operation . Specifically the TCD is updated to reflect the course has been started.

On the other hand if the agent request received is to terminate on demand training as indicated in operation the TCD is retrieved in operation and the CDS is instructed in operation to terminate the content delivery. A confirmation of termination is received in operation and the TCD is updated to reflect the cessation of the training. The TCD may up updated to reflect the course was completed or not and if not a bookmark may be recorded in the TCD.

The I F module may also interact with the CHS . These types of interactions are often associated with flex time training that are initiated by the e learning module as opposed to the agent. In one embodiment the I F module receives indications of an agent s status from the CHS and the e learning module uses this to determine whether snippet training should be provided to the agent. One embodiment of the process is shown in .

In operation an indication of the agent s status from the CHS is received by the I F module. The agent s status may be idle and the I F module may determine that conditions allow the agent to receive snippet training in operation . This may be determined by the I F module itself by applying various training management rules and or by accessing TCD information associated with the agent. In other embodiments another module may be queried not shown and may make the determination whether snippet training should be provided. If no training is to be provided e.g. the agent has not been idle sufficiently long or call volumes are not sufficiently low then the process may loop back to operation . If the agent is to be provided with snippet training then in operation the associated TCD information is retrieved so that a determination can be made as to which training courses may be provided.

In operation a determination is made whether a previous snippet session was interrupted. In other words was a previously started course not completed If so then in operation the I F module instructs the CDS to provide content for that course beginning with the bookmark. If there is no unfinished course then in operation the I F module instructs the CDS to deliver content from the beginning of a new not completed course. In other embodiments the bookmark may be maintained by the CDS so that the I F module merely has to inform the CDS of which course to provide and the CDS starts at the bookmark.

After the CDS has been informed the I F module updates the TCD so that data is maintained about the current training status of the agent. A process flow also exists for the I F module indicating to the CDS to cease snippet training which can be based on indications from the CHS provided to the I F module via interface of increased call volume. Appropriate updates to the TCD are performed as well when snippet training is ceased.

The post training reporting PTR module reports the training results to update training information in the agent s training profile. The PTR module may be invoked by the workflow manager whenever delivery ceases for a training course which can occur after completion of the course or because delivery of the course was interrupted.

The process is shown in and begins with receiving an indication of training cessation. This indication could be received by the workflow manager and used to trigger invocation of the post training reporting module by sending a similar indication to the PTR module as shown in operation . In other embodiments the indication could be directly received by the post training reporting module. The indication could be generated by the CDS in an automated form or the indication could be provided by the Administrator after a conventional classroom training session has completed.

In operation the post training reporting module retrieves the TCD information and validates that the agent should have received the course content. If the course was not to be provided or that agent was not to receive training then receiving such a training completion indicator would be an error condition. This would be reflected by updating the TCD but this operation is not shown in .

A test is performed in operation to determine whether the course requirements were met. This may involve determining that the entire course was delivered that a series of courses were completed that any tests associated with the courses were passed or other such criteria as appropriate. If the course requirements are completed then in operation the agent training profile is updated as appropriate. In operation the workflow manager is informed and the process is completed.

If in operation the course requirements are not met then the reason why they were not met may be analyzed. In this embodiment a determination is made in operation whether the course delivery was completed. If not then in operation a determination is made whether additional time may be allocated to complete the course. This would include e.g. determining whether the course remainder can be completed via on demand training. If not then the TCD is updated to reflect the course was not completed. If in operation additional time can allocated then in operation the course may be indicated as available for on demand training and then the TCD is updated as appropriate in operation .

If in operation the course was completed but the course requirements in operation were not met then this may be indicative that the agent failed a test on the course. In this case the post training reporting module may reschedule the course for the agent in operation and update the agent training profile accordingly in operation . Alternatively the post training reporting module may simply report the condition and let e.g. the Administrator determine whether the course should be rescheduled. The TCD is appropriately updated in operation and the workflow manage is notified in operation . In some embodiments the TCD may record the number of times an agent can take a course and enforce a limit as to how many subsequent attempts are allowed.

The post training reporting module reports the cessation of training when updating the agent profile and or the TCD regardless of training format. In certain embodiments depending on the form if the training requirements are not completed then the remaining portion may be continued via on demand training. Alternatively if training was completed but not passed then the training course may be rescheduled. In any case the TCD is updated so that the e learning module knows the current status of the training including whether it was satisfactory completed why it was not completed and whether it should be available for completion via flex time training or rescheduled as fixed time training.

In some embodiments the post training reporting process may report partial completion of a training course that can never be completed. For example a snippet training course may comprise a large number of trivia questions that are presented in a round robin or selected in a random manner. The course content may be periodically updated. In essence this course is never completed and the nature of the course may be such that no permanent updates to the agent training profile are made. The TCD is continually updated to reflect which question was last presented to an agent and the course is indicated as started but uncompleted. However it may be that the training course is never intended to be completed.

The post training report module may also generate reports to the agent for reporting course results. Alternatively this functionality may be provided via the administration tools. This functionality allows the Administrator to view course status pass rates agent results etc.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that other variations are possible and additional data elements in the TCD may be used to properly define the training context status to allow determination of which actions are to be provided by a particular training flow process module.

The workflow manager ensures that the other modules are invoked as needed and in the correct order. The workflow manager may also handle various exception conditions. In various embodiments the workflow manager may or may not initiate the training flow but in either instance coordinates the sequence of the training flow. In one embodiment the initiation of the training flow may begin either by processing agent performance metrics the automatic agent selection or by processing Administrator input manual agent selection by the agent selection module.

The workflow manager in operation then invokes the manual agent selection module. This module may provide various GUI based agent selection tools allowing the Administrator to select agents for training for a particular course. After the manual agent selection module has completed it will notify the workflow manager which receives the notification in operation . At this point an SEL ATL exists.

Next in operation the workflow manager invokes the registration module that uses the SEL ATL to then register the agents. Once the registration module has completed an indication is received in operation that registration is completed. At this point an R ATL exists.

The workflow manager next determines in operation for each agent and or course whether the training is fixed time or flex time training. If the training is fixed time then scheduling is required. This results in the workflow manager invoking the scheduling module in operation . Once scheduling has completed an indication is received at the workflow manager in operation . At this point a schedule is created but in many embodiments this is stored in the WFM. In some embodiments scheduling information may also be stored in the ATL. If the training is flex time then no scheduling is required and the scheduling module is effectively bypassed.

The workflow manager may wait for an event to trigger the training in operation . This event is referred to as a training triggering event TTE and how and when it is generated depends on the training format involved. For fixed time training the receipt of a training notification from the WFM may function as the TTE. The TTE could be either an indication of an upcoming training break for an agent or the actual notification of the beginning of the training break. For flex time training the TTE could be receipt of an agent request to initiate on demand training. The TTE could also be a determination from a process monitoring the agent status and determining the agent is available for snippet training.

Turning to the workflow manager in operation retrieves the TCD to determine the training format involved. The actions the workflow manager takes at this junction may depend on the training format. The choices for one embodiment are shown in which represent three common training examples 

The fixed time delivery of e learning content can be embodied by an agent being assigned to take an e learning course at their workstation during a scheduled training session. When content delivery occurs the workflow manager invokes the CDS I F module to instruct the training content to be delivered in operation . During the delivery of content the WFM may track when the agent s training scheduling including when the break is about to end or actually ends. The WFM will notify the e learning module of the end of the training session which informs the workflow manager that the training break has completed. Consequently the workflow manager effectively determines in operation whether the training break is completed or not. If not completed then the training content continues to be provided in operation and loops back to operation . If training is completed then the workflow manager in operation informs the CDS I F module that the training break is done which in turn informs the CDS to cease content delivery.

If in operation the TCD indicates that the training is flex time delivery of e learning content the workflow manager then invokes the CDS I F module in operation to provide the training content. Flex time training of e learning content may be either on demand or snippet based. If the latter then the e learning module may terminate snippet training if call volumes increase so that the agent is required to handle calls. Thus in operation the workflow manager determines whether the training is snippet based. If so then in operation the workflow manager will periodically check whether conditions allow training to continue. Various other conditions may be defined limiting snippet training. If conditions in operation allow training to continue then the process loops back and continues monitoring conditions. If training cannot continue in operation the workflow manager notifies the I F CDS which in turn informs the CDS system to end snippet training.

If in operation the training is on demand e.g. it is not snippet based then the training may continue until the course is completed which is reflected in operation by the workflow manager receiving an indication of completion from the CDS I F module.

Returning to operation the workflow manager may perform another course of action if the training is fixed time facilities based instruction. In this form of training the agent is scheduled to report to a training facility such as a classroom. In this case the workflow manager may inform the agent of the location in operation and after the course the instructor may provide the training results. This may result in the workflow manager calling the post training reporting module in operation .

The workflow manager may invoke the post training reporting module in operation after training is completed regardless of training format so that updates to the agent profile may be maintained. The post training reporting module may invoked by the workflow manager to update the agent training profile in light of the updated TCD information. Once the post training reporting module has completed as reflected by receiving an indication in operation the workflow manager process is done and the training flow is completed.

One skilled in the art will recognize that a number of process flow variations are possible with respect to the workflow manager. For example some of the functions identified as occurring in the workflow manager may occur instead in one of the invoked modules. For example if the training is fixed time facilities based instruction then a GUI may be provided to the classroom instructor so they can report whether the agents attended the session completed the course and passed any tests. If so the GUI could be provided either by the workflow manager or the PST module. The GUI would collect and pass the data to the post training reporting module.

The coordination of activities between the various identified components and modules can be further illustrated by the message flow shown in . This message flow illustrates only one portion of the messaging between various components and focuses on messaging involving the delivery of the training content. It is assumed that agents have been selected for training in some manner e.g. the ATL indicates the agents that were selected registered and scheduled for training. In this example the messaging flow is for delivery of training content in a fixed time manner and is further based on the training content being delivered to the agent s workstation as opposed to a facilities based lecture format.

Turning to there are five entities represented the WFM the call handler system the e learning module the content delivery system and the agent workstation. The process begins with message which is initiated by the WFM and sent to the agent workstation informing the agent of an upcoming training break. The WFM may indicate text along with the time of the upcoming training break indicating the purpose of the training. For example the early notification message could indicate You have an upcoming training session on Telemarketing Basics at 2 30 p.m. The WFM may send what is essentially a copy of this message or one with similar content to the e learning module in message . These messages which are sent to the agent s workstation and the e learning module may be sent contemporaneously or in reverse order from what is illustrated. The early notification of an upcoming training session may not be implemented in all embodiments but doing so provides the agent with time to prepare for the training session.

The next set of messages and are the actual notification message initiated by the WFM to indicate the actual start of the training session. The message is sent from the WFM to the agent workstation to inform the agent of the beginning of the training session. Contemporaneously a message is sent from the WFH to the call handler system to pause the agent from receiving calls. Finally another message is sent from the WFM informing the e learning module of the start of the training session for the agent. This message may also indicate the course number to the e learning module and the agent identifier.

In some embodiments the agent may be asked to confirm that they are ready to receive the training. This embodiment is not shown in .

The e learning module upon receiving the notification of the beginning of the training break can treat this message as a training triggering event. This message from the WFM to the e learning module causes the e learning module to initiate content delivery. The initiation and delivery of content is represented by messages and . Specifically the message is sent from the e learning module to the content delivery system to instruct it to prepare for delivery of the indicated training content. In response the content delivery system returns in message a link comprising an URL or other form of address. This message is sent from the CDS to the e learning module to forward the link to the agent workstation. The e learning module sends the link in message to the agent workstation. The messaging may include various security checks such as a time limited security value used by the CDS to verify that the requesting agent is authorized to access the CDS. Specifically the message provided by the CDS may have a security nonce that is conveyed to the agent workstation and incorporated in the access messaging to authorize that agent. After the link is sent to the agent s workstation the agent may select the link in message which can be interpreted as a request to the CDS to access the training content. The content delivery system may verify the information and then provide the content in message s .

The above messaging example is one mechanism for accomplishing the connection between the agent workstation and the content delivery system. The provision of the training content can be in various forms. The agent workstation may access a web site hosted by the content delivery system or receive a presentation file downloaded to the agent workstation and executed locally. The concepts and technologies disclosed herein can be used with any of the known methods for transferring training information between a computer and a server including those involving use of scripting languages applets locally executed programs web browsers web based languages etc. Thus the messaging is one embodiment of how content can be delivered to the agent s workstation and those skilled in the art may define other approaches for the e learning module to coordinate content delivery from the content delivery system to the agent workstation. The content delivery can take various forms from a multimedia presentation interactive GUI webinar web cast or other forms known in the art.

After the training content has been delivered the content delivery system may transmit a message to the e learning module indicating that training has been completed. This may cause the workflow manager to invoke the post training reporting module. This may result in messaging internal to the e learning module which is not shown in .

After the completion of the training session the agent may still have remaining time of a work shift to complete and so the agent has to be returned to a state ready to handle calls. This is accomplished in messaging . The WFM monitors the time and knows when the agent s training session is scheduled to end. In message the WFM sends a resume message to the call handling system to inform it that the agent is now available to handle calls. Contemporaneously the WFM provides a copy of the resume message to the e learning module to inform it that the training break has ended. In one embodiment the training break may already have ended before the resume message is sent to the e learning module so as to provide a time buffer for the agent. If the content delivery system has not informed the e learning module that content delivery has completed then the e learning module will transmit a message indicating that the training session has ended and that the content delivery should terminate content delivery. The WFM may also provide a message to the agent workstation indicating that the agent is now on line for handling calls. The notifications from the WFM to the agent workstation may involve displaying an icon or sending a message to the agent s workstation indicating the change in status.

As shown in the message flow for coordinating the beginning of a training break involves the following components the WFM which maintains the agent s schedule the call handler for suspending and resuming calls to the agent the content delivery system for delivering training content and the e learning module coordinating these components. The messaging shown is illustrative of one embodiment and other embodiments may involve a greater degree of handshaking between the components error handling and features.

The CDS may be a closely integrated system operated and controlled by the call center which may operate and control the WFM and CHS. In other embodiments the call center may contract out to a third party content training provider. In this embodiment the CDS may be remotely accessed and can be one of several CDS utilized to provide training content to agents in the call center.

A third party training content provider may generate training content offered as a fee for service. For example a third party training provider may provide training content for a certain topic which may be required to meet various federal regulations or industry certifications. For example a call center dealing with medical information may receive training for their agents on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPPA related regulations. In another example a client engaging a call center to engage in a calling campaign for a particular financial product may provide product training content for the agents prior to commencement of the campaign.

A variety of sources for training content are to be accommodated and using a third party CDS may require mechanisms to 1 accommodate identification and access to the CDS by the e learning module 2 incorporate appropriate security and authentication mechanisms and 3 provide financial billing and settlement procedures.

The identification and access of the third party CDS may require indicating for each course the appropriate third party content provider hosting the content. This could be indicated by the Administrator when configuring the system by defining content provider names and their associated address. The TCD may indicate for each course the content provider name which could be resolved to a URL for accessing the content provider.

The third party content provider may require validation for each agent allowed to connect with the third party content provider. Mechanisms maybe required for the e learning module to convey the agent s credentials or a secondary set of credentials so that the agent is not required to log in. Further when indicating to the third party CDS what course should be provided to the agent the course indication may have to match to the course identification scheme used by the third party content provider. This can be done using translation tables as is known to those skilled in the art. This also can be maintained in the TCD.

In addition the call center may contract out for various training programs with the same provider at various times for the same set of agents. This may require identification of an appropriate contract for services when establishing the training. For example a call center may negotiate two contracts for receiving different training content for its agents. It may be advantageous to reference which contract is involved when an agent receives training content. Further financial settlement procedures may be incorporated for receiving content from a third party source. This allows invoicing and payments to be made in advance periodically or for each course downloaded.

One possible messaging flow illustrating additional information to be exchanged between the e learning module and the third party content delivery system is shown in . The initial messaging may involve messaging for establishment of a secure connection. This can use existing secure protocols digital signatures digests or other mechanisms to ensure that the information that will be exchanged is secure. This is particularly pertinent if financial settlement information will be later exchanged.

Next messaging for preparing for content delivery may indicate a client identifier e.g. the call center provider the agent identifier and credentials the course identification and a contract identifier. This allows the content provider to identify the client the agent the course and the contract governing the delivery of information. A confirmation message is provided by the third party content delivery system in response.

Messages and request content delivery and confirm the same. No new data elements may be required in this embodiment for requesting content delivery. Upon completion of training indicated by message a training completion certification may be sent that certifies completion of training. In one embodiment this certificate is proof itself that training was provided and completed by the agent similar in concept to a diploma . This certificate can be viewed as a receipt of training delivery and further may be used to prove that the agent received training. For example in order to demonstrate compliance with regulations by showing that agents received certain training the certification can be used as proof of training. Finally additional messaging may be used to provide financial settlement between the call center and the third party content provider including transferring an invoice in message from the content provider and providing payment information . A final confirmation message may also be involved.

The certificate of training may be provided by the CDS to the e learning module and in turn may be provided by the e learning module for storage into the agent training profile. In certain embodiments the certificate of training may incorporate the appropriate authentication data to ensure that it represents a valid certificate. A copy of the certificate or associated authentication data may also be kept by the CDS to facilitate subsequent verification. In some embodiments a copy may be emailed or otherwise communicated to the agent as evidence of completing the course.

In one embodiment the components shown in may all be deployed at the premises of a call center. In another embodiment all the components may be deployed in a hosted manner and the components are shared by various users. In other embodiments various components may be deployed in a hybrid manner where some components are premised based and some are hosted. illustrates one embodiment of a hybrid arrangement .

In the hybrid arrangement involves certain components being hosted or cloud based and other components being premised based . Specifically the e learning system which comprises the various e learning modules and other modules can be provided in a hosted manner to a variety of premise based call centers. The e learning system can access other cloud based service providers such as first content delivery server A or a second content delivery server B. In this embodiment the e learning system interacts with the CHS and the WFM which are premised based. Since the agent training may not occur every day this arrangement allows a call center to receive the services of the e learning system without having to deploy additional hardware or manage the software associated with it for infrequent use.

The various deployments may also have varying levels of integration between the components. In a fully integrated system the operation of the CHS is integrated with the scheduling of a training session as well as receiving updated agent skill levels once the training session is completed. Further in a fully integrated system an agent can seamless transition from call handling to training without having to log out from the CHS and log in to the CDS. In other embodiments the CHS or CDS may not be fully integrated. However not all of the components need to be fully integrated in order to practice the principles and technologies disclosed herein.
