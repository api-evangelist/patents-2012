title: Earphone-based game controller and health monitor
abstract: Design and operation techniques for an earphone-based game controller and health monitor are described herein. In one example, two “ear bud” style earphones are configured as I/O devices, each including a speaker to output sound and an accelerometer to receive an input of motion imparted by a user. The I/O devices may be connected to a mobile device, such as a cellular phone. Accordingly, the I/O devices may be inserted into a user's ears for listening or may be used as game controllers, such as by moving one I/O device in each hand. In a further example, a thermometer may be used in at least one of the I/O devices, and may gather health data by measuring the temperature of the user. And in a further example, a microphone may be used in at least one I/O device to gather heart rate and respiration-quality data regarding the user.

Cellular telephones and music playback devices frequently are sold as a package including the hand unit the phone a charger and earphones. Because earphones are so routinely supplied by manufacturers they are increasingly used with small mobile devices such as cellular telephones and music players. While over the ear phones are known smaller ear bud earphones are more commonly used. Such stereo earphones may include a 3.5 mm plug or similar for attachment to the cell phone.

However while earphones are quite common they are also somewhat limited in functionally. As a result only limited use is made of the earphone jack into which they are connected.

Techniques for the design and operation of an earphone based game controller and health monitor are described herein. In one example two ear bud style earphones are configured as I O devices each including a speaker to output sound and an accelerometer to receive input in the form of motion imparted by a user. The I O devices may be connected to a mobile device such as a cellular phone. Software applications running on the mobile device may provide an output signal to the I O devices and receive input data from them. In one example the I O devices may be used as output devices that provide sound that may be heard when the I O devices are inserted into a user s ears. Alternatively the I O devices may be used as input devices such as game controllers by moving one accelerometer equipped I O device in each hand. In a further example a thermometer may be used in at least one of the I O devices and may gather health data by measuring a body temperature of the user. And in a still further example a microphone may be used in at least one I O device to gather heart rate and respiration quality data.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The term techniques for instance may refer to device s system s method s and or computer readable instructions as permitted by the context above and throughout the document.

The disclosure describes examples of the design and operation of an earphone based game controller and health monitor. In one example accelerometers in each of two ear bud style earphones may be separately manipulated. Separate accelerometer data from the two accelerometers is provided to software such as a video game operating on a mobile device such as a cell phone. Additional sensors in one or both earphones such as a thermometer a microphone and others allow the ear buds to obtain health data from a user. For example sensors in the ear buds may allow tracking of the user s body temperature heart rate respiration rate respiration effectiveness e.g. congestion coughing wheezing etc. and other factors. Additionally the earphone based game controller and health monitor may protect the user from other dangers such as by reporting the user falling especially among the elderly or reporting the approach of a car especially among those jogging and listening to music .

This brief introduction including section titles and corresponding summaries is provided for the reader s convenience and is not intended to describe and or limit the scope of the claims or any section of this disclosure.

In the example of a base unit is used as an interface between the I O devices and the mobile device . Alternatively the functionality of the base unit could be provided by the I O devices and or the mobile device . The base unit may be configured to provide a power supply to the I O devices audio signal pass through to the I O devices and data processing functionality. In the example of an audio jack e.g. a 2.5 or 3.5 mm jack may be used to connect the wired connection of the I O devices to the base unit . Alternatively the wiring may be connected to the base directly without the use of a removable jack. The base unit may be connected to the mobile device by a jack e.g. a 2.5 or 3.5 mm audio jack .

The I O devices may be configured for use in the left and right ears of a user and may each contain an output device such as a speaker. Additionally the I O devices may function as input devices for example one or more of the I O devices may be configured with one or more sensors such as accelerometer s thermometer s microphone s etc. In one example an accelerometer in each I O device allows the user to manipulate one I O device in each hand to create a complex accelerometer input having two input motions. The input motions may be considered individually or in a combined manner by an application such as a video game operating on the mobile device. A thermometer in one or both I O devices may provide data on the user s body temperature while a microphone in one or both I O devices may provide data on the user s heart rate respiration rate and or respiration quality coughing wheezing etc. and the like. As discussed infra these and other sensors may provide additional health benefits.

A wiring harness assembly may provide electrical connectivity between components in the base and one or both I O devices. If quick connect and disconnect are desired a jack and associated socket may be provided. In one example the jack may be a terminal portion of the wiring see and the socket e.g. an earphone port may be part of the base . Accordingly the jack of the wiring may be plugged into the socket of the base . Alternatively the wiring harness may be directly wired to I O devices thereby obviating need for the jack and associated socket. In such an example the base and I O devices would be wired together as a unit. In the example of wiring harness may provide wiring conductors for a power line an audio signal and a microphone input . The microphone input may provide data input from the I O device s which may include multiplexed data from a plurality of sensors e.g. accelerometers a thermometer microphone etc. .

A power conversion and audio pass through device may receive left and right stereo inputs corresponding to left and right tracks of an audio channel. As output the power conversion and audio pass through device provides a power output conductor and a pass through audio signal . The power conversion and audio pass through device may be a discrete device or a functional block that may be integrated within other functional units.

The power conversion and audio pass through device may be used to provide power to devices and or components in the base unit and the I O devices see . Power conversion portions of the device may utilize a signal on one of two stereo inputs e.g. the left or the right track of a stereo input as a source of power. For example a steady tone on the left track e.g. a steady frequency and amplitude may be converted into a power source having a desired voltage potential. By varying the signal e.g. amplitude and frequency the power conversion functionality may be varied to produce a desired power level.

The audio pass through portions of the device may pass through the audio channel not used for power generation. That is the audio signal may pass through the device with little or no alteration. In particular the audio channel may be passed through to the I O devices see . In one example a mono signal is passed through the device to both I O devices . Thus one of the left or right audio channels may be used to generate power while the other sound channel is passed through to speakers in one or both I O devices.

A data processor may be configured to process data obtained from one or more sensors within one or more of the I O devices. The processing may include organizing the data into a format expected by one or more applications operating on the mobile device multiplexing the data obtained from two I O devices and other tasks. The data from the plurality of sensors may include data from one or more of accelerometers thermometers microphones gyroscopes cameras light sensitive diodes or other sensing devices provided by the I O devices and or the base unit . Output from the data processor may be provided on a further segment of the microphone input . The data processor may include a microprocessor or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC and may include a memory device an I O device or gate s and or any logic circuitry indicated by a particular application or use.

An audio jack assembly may electrically connect the left and right stereo audio conductors and the segment of the microphone input with the jack . Thus the audio jack assembly may include wiring connections required to establish electrical connection to the mobile device . The connections may include the jack configured to plug into the mobile device and connections to the power conversion and audio pass through device and the data processor to the mobile device.

A wiring harness may provide electrical connectivity between the I O devices and the base if present or to the mobile device e.g. if the functionality of the base is included in the mobile device . The wiring harness may include the wiring seen in together with any required connections fasteners strain relief devices etc. If quick connect and disconnect are desired a jack may be located at a terminal end of the wiring and an associated socket may be provided in the base or mobile device . Accordingly the jack allows the I O devices to be collectively plugged in to the socket of the base . In an alternative example the jack may be plugged into the earphone socket defined in the mobile device .

A sound actuator may be a speaker and may be of a type or construction found in ear bud earphones or larger headset earphones. In one example a sound actuator will be provide in both I O devices . The sound actuator may receive a sound signal which both provides energy and information to the sound actuator . The sound signal may be a mono version of a stereo input a single channel of a stereo input or may be a single channel audio input.

The I O device may have an inertial measurement unit IMU such as an accelerometer. The accelerometer detects movement of the I O device . In some implementations the movement will result from movement of the I O device in a hand of the user who may be providing input to an application such as a video game operating on the mobile device . In other implementations the movement will result from movement of the user s head while wearing the I O devices as ear buds. The IMU sensors may receive power as an input and provide accelerometer data as an output.

A digital thermometer may be provided in one or both I O devices. Since the I O device may be worn by a user as an ear bud style earphone the digital thermometer may provide data indicating a body temperature of the user. The body temperature may be used as input for health related application s operable on the mobile device .

A microphone and or other miscellaneous sensors may also be provided in one or both I O devices. A microphone may provide health related information about the user such as heart rate respiration rate and or respiration problems e.g. coughing and or wheezing or similar. A health related application running on the mobile device may turn off the sound actuator while the microphone operates. Other sensors may be installed on one or more of the I O devices including a camera a photodiode a gyroscope a magnetometer and or other sensor devices s .

A microcontroller may be used to receive and process output from the IMU sensors e.g. accelerometer digital thermometer microphone and other sensors. The microcontroller may be and or include a microprocessor one or more memory device s an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a collection of cooperating processing devices or the like. The microcontroller may be configured to process the output from the sensors such as by interpreting digital and analog signal s formatting data multiplexing data forming data packets according to a protocol and sending data packets etc. The microcontroller and or associated or adjacent circuitry may provide power to the sensors if required or indicated.

A post processing application may be configured for operation in the base or alternatively in the mobile device . In one example the post processing application may include software configured to operate on the microcontroller of the base . The post processing application may be configured to process the output from the sensors such as by interpreting digital and analog signal s formatting data multiplexing data and forming and sending data packets etc.

A plurality of applications are representative of applications configured for operation on the mobile device . The applications may include or be related to video games entertainment business and productivity health maintenance and health monitoring and others. One or more applications programming interfaces APIs may be available for access by the applications. In the example functionality a gaming API an eHealth API and a sensor API are illustrated. Alternatively the illustrated APIs could be combined into a unified API or further subdivided augmented or otherwise altered as indicated by particular circumstances and design goals. The APIs may be configured to provide the applications with access to sensor data control over sensors etc. In one example the APIs may communicate with the post processing application as a source of sensor information and control. Additionally one or more drivers may be available to configure program operate control and or interface with one or more the sensors within the I O device s .

In an addition or alternative to the applications remote applications may be available and may be operated and or executed by the mobile device through a network such as the Internet. The remote applications may be configured to access the APIs and or drivers and to obtain sensor data from one or more I O devices such as through operation of the post processing application .

The applications and may be configured for a wide variety of purposes. By way of example and without limiting the purposes and or functionality of usable applications generally a number of application topics can be indicated. Applications may use accelerometers in one or both I O devices ear buds for game video game and health assessment and monitoring functionality. The data obtained from two accelerometers may be considered to be complex in that two signals may be used. If the user holds one I O device in each hand the accelerometer signals may be interpreted either as a single two handed gesture or two one handed gestures. For example a two handed gesture might be interpreted as the user s two hands on two spots on a possibly imaginary steering wheel in a video game race car. Alternatively a video game could interpret two one handed gestures such as pointing a gun with one hand e.g. left to right movement with the left hand and reloading the gun with the other hand e.g. a circular movement with the right hand .

One or more of the applications and may be configured to use a microphone in a manner similar to a stethoscope such as to listen to heart rate respiration rate breathing issues such as coughing and wheezing detecting chewing patterns. Additionally applications could use input from one or more microphones to detect buzzers smoke alarms the approach of cars or a fall by a user wearing the I O devices as a headset. Additionally applications can listen to a user s heart rate for indications that the user is exercising and may use that information to coordinate appropriate selections of music to be played over the speakers of the I O devices. Such an application could also provide a musical transition after a workout such as to more mellow music. The applications may also analyze sleep such as by use of the microphone s and accelerometers to check breathing rate snoring teeth clenching and or grinding and or the signs of sleep apnea.

One or more of the applications and may also relate to be involved with and or monitor promote or enhance exercise and fitness. Exercise patterns trips and falls estimated calories burned minutes spent walking running standing and sitting may all be estimated recognized and or determined. A thermometer may measure body temperature and may correlate temperature data with exercise and or health data. A camera may be used by one or more application for such purposes as distinguishing weather lighting levels inside and outside locations and for reasons of user safety and or public safety.

The example methods of can be understood in part by reference to the configurations of . However contain general applicability and are not limited by other drawing figures and or prior discussion. Each method described herein is illustrated as a collection of acts blocks or operations in a logical flow graph which represent a sequence of operations that can be implemented in hardware e.g. application specific integrated circuits software e.g. execution of statements on a processor attached to memory or a combination thereof. The methods may include storing in a memory communicatively coupled to a processor computer executable instructions for performing a method such as a method to implement an earphone based game controller and health monitor and executing the instructions on the processor.

In the context of software the operations represent computer executable instructions stored on one or more computer readable storage media that when executed by one or more processors perform the recited operations. Such storage media processors and computer readable instructions can be located within the system e.g. the system and example functionality of according to a desired design or implementation. The storage media associated with the data processor and or microcontroller and seen in are representative of storage media generally both removable and non removable and of any technology. Thus the recited operations represent actions such as those described in and may be performed under control of one or more processors configured with executable instructions to perform actions indicated. Generally computer executable instructions include routines programs objects components data structures and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular abstract data types. The order in which the operations are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation and the described operations may be combined in different orders and or in parallel to implement the method. The above discussion may apply to other methods described herein.

Additionally for purposes herein a computer readable media may include all or part of an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other hardware device. Such a hardware device may be configured to include other functionality including functions performed in game controlling and or health assessing and or monitoring. Accordingly within such an integrated circuit one or more processors are configured with executable instructions which may be defined by logic transistors or other components or on board memory.

In contrast communication media may embody computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transmission mechanism. As defined herein computer readable media does not include communication media.

Accelerometer data may be used for applications related to gaming entertainment education health maintenance and diagnosis and other topics. In example embodiments using two I O devices each I O device may be configured with an accelerometer and data from the two accelerometers may be used in a separate or combined manner. illustrate examples of accelerometer data handling.

At operation signals output from accelerometers in each of two I O devices are received. In the context of the example of signals from two I O devices may be received at the base unit and or at the mobile device . As seen in each I O device may include an accelerometer configured as an inertial measurement unit .

At operation the received accelerometer signals are processed to provide output which may be complex. Referring to the context of the example of the accelerometer signals may be received by the microcontroller within the I O device and or by the data processor of the base unit .

At operation accelerometer data representing a complex movement may be put on the microphone conductor for transmission to a base unit if present and then for use by application s running on a mobile device. In the context of the example of the complex accelerometer data is placed by the data processor on the microphone input for transmission to the mobile device see . In the context of the example of the microphone input of the mobile device is a port through which data may be introduced into the mobile device. Accordingly by providing data representing the complex output of the accelerometers on the microphone conductor the data is introduced to the mobile device and is available for applications accessible to the device running locally and or remotely.

At operation the complex output of the accelerometers is examined to determine if a meaning has been assigned to combined movements of the first and second accelerometer signals. For example the accelerometer data may be examined to determine if it represents one two handed gesture or two one handed gestures.

At operation if a meaning has been assigned to the combined accelerometer data obtained from two accelerometers then the data is used in a combined manner by an application or other consumer of the data. For example if a single two handed gesture has been assigned to or has been associated with the accelerometer data and or gesture then the data is used in the combined manner.

At operation if no meaning has been assigned to the combined accelerometer data then the data from each accelerometer is used individually by the consumer of the data e.g. an application . For example if no single two handed gesture has been assigned then the accelerometer data may be used as two one handed gestures.

At operation complex accelerometer data is sent by the I O devices to the mobile device or to the base for processing. Depending on the configuration of the earphone based game controller and health monitor a base unit may interface between the I O devices and the mobile device . In such a configuration the complex accelerometer data may be sent by the I O devices to an application e.g. post processing application operating on the data processor of the base unit . In other configurations the accelerometer data may pass through the base unit if present and be received by an application running on the mobile device or operating remotely such as in a data or Internet based cloud.

At operation the complex accelerometer data is interpreted to distinguish combined and separate portions of the data. That is portions of the complex accelerometer data that involve combined input of the two accelerometers are distinguished from portions of the data that involved separate interpretation of movements of the two accelerometers. In one example the motions of the two accelerometers are considered and if they are consistent with motions that have previously been assigned a combined meaning then the combined motions are distinguished from separate motions of the two accelerometers.

At operation a screen display of a mobile device may be altered based at least in part on the interpreted complex accelerometer data. In one example a video game application operating on the mobile device may react to accelerometer input by changing content displayed on the screen. The accelerometer input may change screen content based on either a combined meaning of two accelerometers or according to separate meanings of the two accelerometers.

At operation a signal from a thermometer may be multiplexed with the complex accelerometer data for transmission on a microphone conductor. In the context of the example of the digital thermometer provides raw data to the microcontroller which multiplexes the provided data with data from the IMU accelerometers and or other sensors if present. The multiplexed data may be put onto a microphone conductor that is input to the mobile unit.

At operation the signal from the thermometer may be interpreted by an application running on the mobile device. The interpretation may include converting an analog signal to digital converting digital data into a representation of temperature assigning units of measurement e.g. Fahrenheit or Celsius assigning a time of measurement and or other processing.

At operation data obtained from the signal and or the interpretation of the signal is stored. The storing may include representing the signal from the thermometer in an appropriate data structure.

At operation a warning is provided to the user if the temperature data is not within an acceptable e.g. a healthy range. At operation the recorded temperature data and or any warnings may be communicated with a remote facility such as a family member doctor s office clinic hospital or emergency call center etc.

Rather the specific features and acts are disclosed as exemplary forms of implementing the claims.
