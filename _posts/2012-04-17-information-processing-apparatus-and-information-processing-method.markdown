Further the first program guide displaying unit displays a popularity transition indicator of the temporarily selected program. When the latest popularity rank of the temporarily selected program is acquired the first program guide displaying unit sets the popularity transition indicator to show the status of transition as compared with the past popularity rank e.g. rise decline or no change .

When a predetermined viewer operation e.g. depression of a designated button in the controller is initiated by the viewer for the temporarily selected program in the first program guide the data processing unit acknowledges that the temporarily selected program is designated as a formally selected program. This causes the program image displaying unit to switch the program image displayed in the image display screen to the image of the formally selected program. For example the program image acquisition unit acquires the image information on the formally selected program from the tuner and the program image displaying unit displays the program image of the formally selected program on the display .

The first program guide displaying unit may further display the live indicator and or the programmed recording indicator providing the ground for the current popularity rank associating the indicator with the program for which the popularity rank indicator is displayed or the temporarily selected program not shown in . According to this form the viewer can view the data itself that indicates the actual status of viewing in addition to the popularity rank which is an abstraction of the viewing status of the program.

Referring back to a second program guide displaying unit displays the second program guide in the entirety of the screen of the display when the program guide icon is selected in the portal screen. The second program guide shows an arrangement of program information on a plurality of programs using the time axis covering a plurality of time zones as a vertical axis and using the channel axis covering a plurality of channels as a horizontal axis.

The second program guide displaying unit enlarges or reduces the area for the program frames in the second program guide in accordance with a viewer operation. More specifically the second program guide displaying unit enlarges or reduces the size of the program frames per unit time or enlarges or reduces the size of the program frames per channel. Associated with this the volume of program information that can be displayed in each program frame is increased or decreased. For example the mode of displaying the second program guide may be switched such that vertical axis 24 hrs horizontal axis 9 channels vertical axis 5 hrs horizontal axis 7 channels vertical axis 3 hrs horizontal axis 5 channels or vertical axis 2 hrs horizontal axis 3 channels. 

The second program guide displaying unit displays the program title of the program started to be broadcast on the first line of the program frame in the second program guide and displays the program summary in the second and subsequent lines. In the second program guide where vertical axis 24 hrs horizontal axis 9 channels the program frame for a 30 minute program is displayed so as to consume a minimum unit of display i.e. a single line. Thus program information for a program that lasts less than minutes is displayed in a balloon in accordance with the movement of a cursor described later.

The cursor displaying unit displays the cursor for selecting a program frame. The viewer uses the cursor to select the program frame of a program for which the viewer wishes to know more detailed information or a program that the viewer desires to control for viewing. The program highlighted by the cursor is designated as a temporarily selected program. The second program guide displaying unit enlarges the program frame of the temporarily selected program in the direction of channel axis i.e. displays the program frame in a larger size than the other program frames. Further the second program guide displaying unit displays the program summary of the temporarily selected program in a program summary field allowing the scrolling of the display.

The second program guide displaying unit displays program information on the formally selected program e.g. channel name broadcasting station name program title broadcast date and time viewing status program summary in a program detail window . A viewing status indicator shows the number of viewers of the formally selected program. More specifically the live indicator the programmed recording indicator or a total thereof may be displayed. When the formally selected program is designated the second program guide displaying unit displays the program detail window superimposing the program detail window on the second program guide in a pop up mode of display and displaying the second program guide in the background in a reduced image quality. For example the second program guide may be displayed in a blurred manner by removing high frequency components from the image data for the second program guide. Alternatively a semitransparent object may be displayed on the image of the second program guide.

A description will now be given of a variation adapted for a case where the display is a 3D display capable of stereographic display. The image of the program frame of the program selected by the cursor i.e. the temporarily selected program and or the image of the program detail window as displayed by the second program guide displaying unit may be a parallax view split temporarily or spatially.

For example when the viewer wears eyeglasses with a shutter a temporally split parallax view may be displayed and when the viewer wears eyeglasses with a polarization plate a spatially split parallax view may be displayed. Typically the program frame of the temporarily selected program and or the program detail window is displayed in front of the second program guide.

According to this variation viewability of the program frame of the temporarily selected program and or the program detail window is increased. Whether a parallax view is displayed or the mode of parallax view may be preset by the viewer. Alternatively the information processing apparatus may detect the type of the display and determine dynamically in accordance with the type.

Further the second program guide displaying unit temporarily displays a setting window for setting the character font of the second program guide on the display along with the second program guide. shows an exemplary second program guide as displayed. When a particular character font is designated by the viewer in a setting window the second program guide displaying unit immediately reflects the designated character font in the second program guide currently displayed. In other words the second program guide as displayed is switched to the guide in which program information is shown using the designated character font. shows an example in which the character size is changed. Alternatively the character style i.e. the type face may be similarly changed.

The second program guide displaying unit scrolls the second program guide in the time axis direction or the channel axis direction in accordance with the movement of the cursor in the second program guide thereby switching the displayed content in the second program guide. As regards the program frame a part of which is no longer displayed as a result of the scrolling in the time axis direction and which shows a program that has not been completely broadcast yet the second program guide displaying unit displays the program information that should be displayed in that program frame in an area that remains displayed after the scrolling starting at the head of the program information. In other words the second program guide displaying unit displays broadcast start time indicated by minutes program title in preference to the program summary.

The display area of program frames and of is reduced as compared to the status in . Since the program of the program frame is currently broadcast the second program guide displaying unit displays as much of the program information as can be fitted in the area of the program frame that remains displayed starting at the head of the information. In other words the position where the program information as displayed starts is shifted to the head of the remaining area.

Meanwhile since the programs for the program frames and have already been broadcast the second program guide displaying unit does not change the position where the program information as displayed starts. The second program guide displaying unit may display the program information of the program that has already been broadcast in a mode not so noticeable as that of the program information of the program not completely broadcast yet e.g. using a light gray character color and may not change the position where the program information starts in the program frame displayed in that mode.

Referring back to when the video icon is selected in the portal screen the video control screen displaying unit displays a video screen for controlling the operation of recording playing back the program on the display . The video control screen displaying unit includes a recording list displaying unit . The recording list displaying unit displays a list of recordings that includes information on recorded content and a list of programmed recordings.

In one variation the list of recordings in the video screen may contain only the information related to the content already recorded. In this case the information on programmed recording may be displayed in a schedule screen at the destination of transition reached when the schedule icon is selected in the portal screen.

Referring back to the viewing status communicating unit periodically transmits viewing status data to the information management server . The viewing status data associates the program ID of the program currently displayed by the program image displaying unit i.e. the program ID of the program currently viewed by the viewer with the attribute information of the viewer. Further the viewing status communicating unit periodically refers to the recording information in the recording information storage unit and periodically transmits viewing status data to the information management server . The viewing status data associates the program ID of the program programmed to be recorded with the attribute information of the viewer. The frequency of communicating the viewing status may be determined in light of the real time performance required to collect viewing status and of the network and system load comparing the requirements. For example the frequency may be once in every one minute.

A description will now be given of the operation in the configuration described above. is a flowchart showing the operation of the information processing apparatus . The figure primarily shows the operation initiated via a user interface. When an instruction for starting the program viewer AP is acknowledged in the information processing apparatus the portal screen displaying unit displays a portal screen S . When a user operation is not detected N in S and a predetermined period of time or more has elapsed in that state Y in S the standby screen displaying unit displays a standby screen S whereupon a determination in S is performed for a second time. When the elapsed time during which an operation is not detected is less than the predetermined period of time N in S control is returned to S without displaying a standby screen.

In the portal screen the latest information pop is displayed in association with each of the icons for selecting respective functional screens. The status tag indicating the viewing status or operating status is also displayed. In this way the viewer can view the useful latest information in the portal screen without making a transition to each functional screen. Consequently viewer convenience is improved. By displaying a thumbnail image of recorded content in the portal screen or standby screen the viewer can not only view the recorded content but also enjoy viewing the history of recording. For example since the standby screen shows a thumbnail image in a varying mode the standby screen may be displayed as some sort of an interior decoration. By allowing a thumbnail image to be displayed in a mode that varies depending on the date and time of recording the viewer can easily identify and determine a recorded content to view.

When a viewer operation is detected Y in S the standby screen displaying unit terminates the display of the standby screen if it is being displayed. When the operation of selecting the TV icon is detected Y in S a live image display process described later is performed S . When the detected operation is not the selection of the TV icon N in S S is skipped. When the operation of selecting the program guide icon is detected Y in S a program guide display process described later is performed S . If the detected operation is not the selection of the program guide icon N in S S is skipped. When the operation of selecting the video icon is selected Y in S a video screen display process described later is performed S . When the detected operation is not the selection of the video icon N in S S is skipped so that the flow of the figure is terminated. When another on screen selection icon is selected in the portal screen the process of displaying a screen corresponding to the selected icon is performed not shown in the figure .

When a ranking determination interval e.g. one minute corresponding to the interval of collecting the viewing status in the information management server elapses the indicator acquisition unit again acquires the latest indicators from the information management server not shown in . The popularity determination unit updates the popularity rank of each program in accordance with the latest indicators. The first program guide displaying unit displays the updated popularity ranking of the programs in the first program guide.

By displaying the first program guide showing ranking indicators along with the live image of the program the viewer can know programs that are currently popular at a glance while viewing the desired program. In the first base technology the viewing status is identified based on a viewing action that can be objectively identified e.g. viewing of a program or a programming of a recording . In this way viewing status can be identified that is more precise than base upon the viewer s subjective indicator of the program e.g. like dislike intend to view or the like i.e. more properly representing the situation.

Since the channel can be switched by controlling the first program guide the viewer can select a program of interest as needed based on the changing ranking order. Since the first program guide shows the progress status of the programs or the status of transition in popularity the viewer can select a program to view by referring to the status. Since the program summary of the program selected by the cursor is displayed in the program summary field allowing the scrolling of the display the area occupied by the first program guide is controlled while allowing the viewer to view a desired program summary. This helps maintain the viewability of program image.

When a request for a search is acknowledged while the program image is being displayed Y in S or when the information related to the program being displayed is updated Y in S absent an explicit search request N in S the search key acquisition unit acquires a search key from the program information S . The search execution unit transmits a search request to the search server and receives a result of the search S . The search result displaying unit displays the browser screen showing the web page retrieved by the search side by side with the image display screen S . Absent an explicit search request and updating of the program related information N in S S through S are skipped so that the flow of the figure is terminated.

According to this form various information related to the program viewed is acquired from web sites on the Internet and presented to the viewer along with the program image. This allows the user to view a variety of information i.e. information not limited to typical program guide information associated with the program viewed. Further since a search key is automatically retrieved from the program information it is not necessary for the viewer to designate a search key. When the information related to a program is updated the information displayed in the browser screen is updated as changes occur. In this way the viewer can view a search result updated based on the latest information on the program without performing a specific operation and can continue to view the program image.

A part of the program frame goes out of the view in association with the movement of the cursor Y in S . When the program frame is for the program being broadcast Y in S the second program guide displaying unit displays the program information in the remaining area of the program frame starting at the head of the information S . When the program frame is for the program already broadcast N in S S is skipped. When none of the parts of the program frame goes out of the view N in S S and S are skipped. When the cursor is not moved N in S S to S are skipped.

Subsequently when the program that the viewer desires to control for viewing is selected in the second program guide i.e. when the program is formally selected Y in S the second program guide displaying unit displays the program information on the selected program in the program detail window in a pop up display mode S . In this case the control icon is displayed to accompany the program detail window . The second program guide is displayed in the background in a blurred manner. When the recording of the formally selected program is programmed Y in S the second program guide displaying unit displays the programmed recording line indicating the time zone of the programmed recording in the second program guide S .

When the recording is not programmed N in S S is skipped. When the program is not formally selected N in S S to S are skipped. When an instruction for changing the display mode of the second program guide e.g. change in character font change in size of program frame etc. is acknowledged Y in S the second program guide displaying unit immediately changes the mode of the second program guide S . When an instruction for changing the display mode is not acknowledged N in S S is skipped.

According to this form the area of the program frame in the second program guide selected by the cursor is dynamically enlarged so that more program information is displayed than before the selection. This reduces necessity for the viewer to perform an extra operation of for example displaying another screen to view program information. In other words the viewer operation for viewing program information is simplified so that the convenience of the electronic program guide is improved. By superimposing the program detail window on the second program guide the viewer is allowed to perform an operation for viewing the program while maintaining an impression of the time or program position viewed in the second program guide. By reducing the image quality of the second program guide in the background of the program detail window the viewability of the program detail window is relatively improved.

The display mode of the second program guide is changed as needed in accordance with user control while maintaining the display of the second program guide i.e. without making a transition to another setting screen. This provides the viewer with immediate feedback resulting from the change in the display mode. For example the viewer can immediately view the change in viewability. Further by setting the programmed recording line in the second program guide in association with the programmed recording the viewer can easily view the setting status of programmed recording even if the viewer cannot directly view the program frame of the program programmed to be recorded due to a large number of channels. This helps prevent duplicate programmed recordings or unexpected overwriting for example.

By displaying the program frame that partly goes out of the view starting at the head of the program information that should be displayed important information program title etc. is displayed in the remaining area of the program frame preferentially. When the program information is displayed starting in the middle of the information the viewer will not be able to determine which program the information is about. By displaying the information from the start the viewer can know the program content easily. By sliding only the program information of the program being broadcast into view in the program frame only the program content of the program that the viewer can view is presented in an easily distinguishable manner.

When an instruction to start playback is acknowledged Y in S the playback processing unit starts playing back the recorded content S and sends the data for recorded image to the program image displaying unit . The program image displaying unit displays the recorded image on the display S . When an instruction to end the playback is not acknowledged N in S control is returned to S. When an instruction to end the playback is acknowledged Y in S the playback processing unit ends the process of playing back the recorded content S and stores the playback progress rate occurring at that moment in the recording information storage unit S . When an instruction to start playback is not acknowledged N in S S to S are skipped.

When the recording process is already started Y in S and when a predetermined ranking determination interval e.g. one minute has elapsed Y in S the indicator acquisition unit acquires the live indicator and the programmed recording indicator from the information management server S . The popularity determination unit determines the popularity ranking in accordance with the indicators S . When the program being recorded is ranked at or higher than a predetermined rank Y in S the recording processing unit inserts a chapter in the recorded data S . When the program being recorded is not ranked at or higher than a predetermined rank N in S S is skipped. When the ranking determination interval has not elapsed N in S S to S are skipped. By inserting a chapter in the recorded content the viewer can easily search for and identify the start of a scene that is popular to viewers when playing back the recorded content.

When the recording end time comes Y in S the recording processing unit ends the recording process S . The thumbnail setting unit sets a thumbnail image from the recorded video and image occurring when the program is ranked at or higher than a predetermined rank and stores the thumbnail image in the thumbnail storage unit S . When the recording end time does not come N in S S and S are skipped. When the recording process is not started yet N in S S to S are skipped. According to this embodiment the scene that is popular to viewers is turned into a thumbnail image so that the recorded content is more easily identified by a thumbnail image.

Described above is an explanation based on the first form of the base technology. This form is intended to be illustrative only and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications to constituting elements and processes could be developed and that such modifications are also within the scope of the first base technology. A description will now be given of variations to the first base technology.

The first variation will be described. The search key acquisition unit of the first base technology uses program information acknowledged as EPG information as a search key. In one variation the information processing apparatus may additionally be provided with a caption information acquisition unit that acquires caption information in character multiplex broadcast so called caption multiplex broadcast from the tuner . The search key acquisition unit may use a caption character string included in the caption information as a search key. For example the search key acquisition unit may subject the caption character string to morphological analysis and use a noun phrase included in the caption character string as a search key. Alternatively when the caption information acquisition unit acquires new caption information the search key acquisition unit may allow the search execution unit to perform a new search using the caption character string included in the new caption information as a new search key.

The second variation will be described. The search key acquisition unit may acquire a search key in accordance with the live indicator or programmed recording indicator acquired by the indicator acquisition unit or the popularity ranking of the programs determined by the popularity determination unit . According to this variation a search result useful for the viewer can easily be provided by using the program related information available when the popularity of the program is increased as a search key.

For example a search key may be acquired from the program information or caption character string available when the live indicator programmed recording indicator or a sum thereof of a program reaches a predetermined value or higher while the image of the program is being displayed. Alternatively a search key may be acquired from the program information or caption character string available when a program reaches a certain popularity rank or higher while the image of the program is being displayed. The caption character string indicator and history of popularity rank may be stored in the data storage unit in association with the program ID and the search key acquisition unit may acquire a search key based on the history information while the recorded content is being played back.

The third variation will be described. In the first form of the base technology the first program guide is assumed to be displayed in a display mode reflecting the popularity ranking of the programs and no reference is made to the second program guide. In one variation the second program guide may also be displayed in a display mode reflecting the popularity ranking of the programs. In this case the second program guide displaying unit may change the display mode e.g. color character font etc. of the program frames of the second program guide in accordance with the popularity ranking determined by the popularity determination unit . Alternatively similarly to the first program guide the popularity indicator or the data for an indicator itself may be displayed in association with the program frame. This variation provides the viewer with information useful for the viewer that selects a program for view in the second program guide. For example a program programmed by a lot of viewers to be recorded can be suggested to the viewer thereby helping the viewer to determine a program that should be programmed for recording.

The fourth variation will be described. The first program guide displaying unit may dynamically change the size of a program frame for each channel typically the length in the direction of channel axis in accordance with the attribute or propensity of the viewer or the information related to the program. For example the first program guide displaying unit may refer to the age group or sex of the viewer and display program frames for channels that are more likely to be viewed by viewers having a selected attribute on a larger scale. Alternatively the higher the current popularity rank the larger the program frame of the program may be displayed. The program frame for a channel in which the broadcasting of a program ends and that of the next program has not been started may be displayed on a smaller scale than the program frames for the other channels in which programs continue to be broadcast. According to this variation the viewability of program frames for channels that are likely to be selected by viewers is improved and the volume of displayable program information can be increased.

The fifth variation will be described. The program image acquisition unit may acquire from the tuner the program image currently ranked at a predetermined rank typically No. 1 or higher as determined by the popularity determination unit . When the popularity ranking changes the channel from which to acquire image information may be dynamically switched in accordance with the change. The program image displaying unit displays the program image acquired by the program image acquisition unit in accordance with the change in popularity ranking on the display . According to this variation a program that is popular to viewers is automatically selected so that the display always displays the image of a popular program. This implements a sort of zapping without viewer intervention.

The sixth variation will be described. When playing back the recorded content the playback processing unit may communicate the information indicating as such to the information management server along with the program ID. The information management server may periodically supply the information processing apparatus with a playback ratio indicating the ratio of viewers that have played back the recorded content with respect to the viewers having programmed the program with the program ID to be recorded associating the ratio with the program ID. The playback ratio is stored in the recording information in the recording information storage unit . The recording list displaying unit may further display the playback ratio in association with each recorded content in the list of recordings. The viewer may select one of the plurality of recorded contents for view by referring to the playback ratio of the recorded contents.

The seventh variation will be described. The recording processing unit may record the live image ranked at or higher than a predetermined rank typically No. 1 even without a viewer operation for recording. In this case the recording processing unit dynamically changes the live image recorded in accordance with a change in popularity ranking. According to this variation the live image of a popular program is always recorded in the background. The viewer can later view a program image popular to other viewers in an efficient manner.

This variation is particularly suitable in the program viewing system provided with a plurality of tuners . According to the first form of the base technology the viewer can refer to the first program guide and know that the popularity of a program different from the program that the viewer is viewing is increased. However the viewer may find it difficult to view the very program image that caused the increase in popularity even if the viewer switches to the other program. According to this variation program images that become popular are always recorded so that the viewer does not miss out on viewing program images that become popular. As a result viewer convenience is improved.

The eighth variation will be described. When a certain viewer operation regarding the cursor movement in the second program guide is acknowledged the cursor displaying unit may allow program frames of programs programmed for recording to be successively selected by the cursor. According to this variation the viewer can efficiently select the program programmed to be recorded in the second program guide.

The ninth variation will be described. In the first form of the base technology the popularity ranking of the programs is determined in the information processing apparatus . In a variation the information management server may determine the popularity ranking of the programs across the entire attributes of viewers and the popularity ranking for each viewer attribute. In this case the indicator acquisition unit of the information processing apparatus may acquire the popularity ranking as the indicator from the information management server . The popularity determination unit may directly output the popularity ranking thus acquired to the data processing unit .

The tenth variation will be described. In the first form of the base technology the history of popularity ranking is stored in the information processing apparatus . In a variation the history of indicators originating the popularity ranking may be stored in the information management server . For example the information management server may further be provided with a tally history storage unit which may store the tally result of viewing status as a tally history associating the result with date and time information. In acquiring the popularity ranking of programs broadcast in the past in the information processing apparatus e.g. in playing back a recorded content the information processing apparatus may acquire the tally history from the information management server to determine the popularity ranking in the past.

The eleventh variation will be described. In the first form of the base technology the program information acquisition unit acquires EPG information from the tuner . In a variation the program information acquisition unit may acquire EPG information from an information provider server on the Internet via the Internet . Further the program information acquisition unit may acquire EPG information from the tuner and acquire program related information that should be appended to the EPG information and displayed in the electronic program guide via the Internet .

The twelfth variation will be described. The functions of the information processing apparatus described in the first base technology may be implemented in the tuner . In this case the tuner may include the CPU GPU main memory hard disk drive network card and interface shown in . The functions shown in may be implemented by the tuner.

As a thirteenth variation an explanation is given of a display mode of a first program guide . shows an exemplary first program guide as displayed in the present exemplary variation. The exemplary first program guide as displayed in the figure corresponds to the one shown in and like signs represent like constituting elements that are identical to or correspond to those shown in . A displayed station indicator shows broadcasting stations being displayed on the image display screen . Program frames and also generically referred to as a program frame of the first program guide each include a view count field a recording count field a view count change field a recording count change field and a progress indicator .

The progress indicator shows the degree of progress of each station program at the current moment. The view count field shows the number of users viewing each station program. The recording count field shows the number of users recording each station program. As described later the number of viewing users in the view count field and the number of recording users in the recording count field are updated periodically for every passing minute in the present exemplary variation and hereinafter . The view count change field shows a difference in the number of the viewing users before and after the update i.e. the value of an increase decrease in the number of the viewing users associated with the update. The recording count change field shows the value of an increase decrease in the number of the recording users associated with the update. The respective values of the view count change field and the recording count change field are also updated in accordance with the update of the view count field and the recording count field .

An explanation is now given of a configuration for achieving the first program guide described above. In addition to the configuration shown in the form of the first base technology the information management server is further provided with an executed recording tally unit for counting the number of users executing recordings. The executed recording tally unit acquires the program ID of the program that the viewer is currently recording from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses on a periodical basis and counts the number of recordings being executed. Therefore the viewing status communicating unit of the information processing apparatus transmits the program ID of the program being recorded by the recording processing unit to the information management server on a periodical basis.

The indicator acquisition unit of the information processing apparatus acquires as a live indicator the number of the viewing users which is the number of users viewing each program currently being broadcast and the number of the recording users which is the number of users recording each program on a periodical basis from the information management server . The popularity determination unit outputs the number of the viewing users and the number of the recording users acquired by the indicator acquisition unit as it is as data indicating the degree of popularity.

The first program guide displaying unit displays the first program guide and the displayed station indicator over a program image being displayed on the image display screen in accordance with a user operation. The first program guide displaying unit sets the number of the viewing users in the view count field calculates the value of an increase decrease in the number of the viewing users before and after the setting and sets the value of the increase decrease in the view count change field . The first program guide displaying unit sets the number of the recording users in the recording count field calculates the value of an increase decrease in the number of the recording users before and after the setting and sets the value of the increase decrease in the recording count change field . The first program guide displaying unit repeats a process of updating the view count field the recording count field the view count change field and the recording count change field every time a new live indicator is acquired by the indicator acquisition unit that is every passing minute.

When the increase decrease in the number of the viewing users is at least a predetermined threshold e.g. plus minus 500 people the first program guide displaying unit highlights the view count change field more than usual as shown in the program frames and in . Similarly when the increase decrease in the number of the recording users is at least a predetermined threshold e.g. plus minus people the first program guide displaying unit highlights the recording count change field more than usual as shown in the program frame in .

As a reference for highlighting in the program frame an increase decrease in the number is used in here. However the first program guide displaying unit may calculate an increase decrease rate and may highlight a field under the condition that the increase decrease rate shows a change of at least a predetermined threshold. Alternatively the first program guide displaying unit may highlight a field when either one or both of the increase decrease in the number and the increase decrease rate are at least the respective predetermined threshold. Alternatively the first program guide displaying unit may highlight a field when either one or both of an increase in the number and an increase rate are at least the respective predetermined threshold or may highlight a field when either one or both of a decrease in the number and a decrease rate are at least the respective predetermined threshold. It is obvious that either an increase or decrease may be used as a requirement.

The first program guide displaying unit may suggest a user a significant increase decrease in the number of the viewing users or the number of the recording users with an effect by displaying a predetermined image or a video image instead of the highlighting in a corresponding program frame . Further with regard to the number of the viewing users and the number of the recording users the increase decrease in the number and or the increase decrease rate may be calculated by the information management server and the information processing apparatus may directly use the increase decrease in the number and or the increase decrease rate.

The first program guide displaying unit sets a progress indicator for a program shown in each program frame . In other words a progress indicator is also set to a program not being viewed by a user or a program in a program frame not being selected by a cursor not shown . This allows the user to more easily overlook the degree of progress of a program including a program that is not being viewed or selected. Thus the user can effectively select a program more easily. The first program guide displaying unit may display the progress indicator while overlaying the indicator on other displays in the program frame and on the program image. In other words the first program guide displaying unit may overlay display the progress indicator on another display object.

The display mode for presenting the degree of progress of a program to a user is not limited to the progress indicator which is in graph form. The first program guide displaying unit may set a different display mode e.g. a different background color to the program frame according to the degree of progress of a program. For example a ratio of displaying a first background color and a second background color of the program frame may be changed sequentially as a progress indicator according to the degree of progress of a program or the ratio of one of the background colors may be increased progressively as the program progresses. Obviously the first program guide displaying unit may also overlay display the progress indicator obtained in this case on another display object. The first program guide displaying unit may display the progress indicator of a program frame that corresponds to a program being selected by the user that is a program being displayed on the image display screen in a mode that is different e.g. in a different color from that of the progress indicator that corresponds to another program not being selected.

When there is a change in the viewing status of the program in the first program guide displaying unit the first program guide displaying unit instantly reflects the change in the first program guide by updating the view count field of the program frame without waiting to acquire information from the information management server . More specifically when a program that is being viewed is switched to another program for example when the operation detection unit detects an operation of switching a program the first program guide displaying unit instantly decrements the view count field of the program frame for the program that had been selected until the switching of the program. The first program guide displaying unit instantly increments the view count field of the program frame that is newly selected.

Similarly when there is a change in the recording status of the program in the first program guide displaying unit the first program guide displaying unit instantly reflects the change in the first program guide by updating the recording count field of the program frame without waiting to acquire information from the information management server . More specifically when the recording of a program is started for example when the operation detection unit detects an operation of starting the recording or when the recording processing unit starts a recording process the first program guide displaying unit instantly increments the recording count field of the program frame of a program to be recorded. When the recording of the program is ended the first program guide displaying unit instantly decrements the recording count field of the program frame of the program that had been recorded.

According to the exemplary variation the number of the viewing users and the number of the recording users of each program are displayed in the first program guide . Therefore a user can more easily know the degree of popularity of each program specifically. Since an increase decrease in the number is displayed the user can more easily know the transition in popularity of each program specifically. Also the user can more easily know almost in real time a program with a drastic increase or decrease in the number of viewing users or the number of the recording users in other words a program having a drastic change in its popularity. As described above the user friendliness for a program selection as well as the interest in viewing the program can be increased by allowing the trend of other viewers to be more easily known in addition to simply allowing a program image to be viewed. For example notifying a user of the presence of a program with increasing popularity arouses a user s desire to view the program preventing the user from missing the program to be viewed.

The posting site server puts a posting site on the Internet that allows for an instant posting of a feedback comment typically short sentences of about 100 characters and also referred to as a tweet of the moment regarding the content of a program that is provided by a viewer viewing the program through the viewer s terminal. To a posted comment a tag hereinafter also referred to as a hashtag may be added by a poster viewer which is for grouping with other comments and more specifically used as a search keyword for searching a plurality of posted comments all at once.

Upon the receipt of a comment acquisition request in other words a search request specifying a specific hashtag the posting site server supplies all at once a client originating a search request with data of at least one comment to which the hashtag is added. Such a posting site includes for example Twitter trademark or registered trademark .

The information processing apparatus of the second base technology provides a new viewing experience to a user by acquiring comments posted to the posting site server by various viewers and then presenting the comments to the user viewing a program being currently broadcast. is a block diagram showing the functional configuration of the information processing apparatus of . In addition to the configuration stated previously in the first base technology the information processing apparatus further includes a comment storage unit a comment processing unit a comment displaying unit and a regional information displaying unit .

In the second base technology it is assumed that program information acquired by the program information acquisition unit and then stored in the program information storage unit includes a service ID and an event ID which are predetermined as identification information for uniquely identifying a single program and information indicating the genre and category e.g. news variety sports etc. to which the program contents belongs. It is also assumed that the data storage unit stores in advance information indicating a user s viewing region that corresponds to at least one specific broadcasting station as the attribute information of the user.

The fixed comment storage unit is a storage area adapted to store a fixed comment which is a prepared comment for supporting the creation of a comment to be posted to the posting site server . shows the configuration of data stored in the fixed comment storage unit . The fixed comment storage unit stores the information indicating a plurality of types of program genres and categories for example news variety sports etc. and fixed comments expected to be appropriate for respective genres in association with each other. These fixed comments are also said to be typical comments that are often posted according to a program genre. A program name in a fixed comment of the figure is dynamically replaced with the name of a program e.g. 7 o clock news etc. being viewed by a user at the time of creating a posting comment as described later.

The comment acquisition unit transmits a comment acquisition request to the posting site server by using as a search key a hashtag identified in accordance with a user operation and then acquires the data of at least one comment to which the hashtag is added from the posting site server . The comment acquisition unit then stores the acquired comment data in the acquired comment storage unit .

By transmitting the data of a comment created by a user on a comment creating screen described later to the posting site server the comment posting unit registers the comment with the posting site server . In posting the comment created by the user the comment posting unit adds to the comment a predetermined hashtag that indicates software hereinafter also referred to as program viewing software which is installed in the information processing apparatus so as to provide a program viewing function and a predetermined hashtag that indicates a broadcasting station being viewed by the user.

The comment acquisition unit and the comment posting unit may perform the above processes by calling an application programming interface API for acquiring a comment and an API for posting a comment from among Web application programming interfaces WebAPI put by the posting site server .

Referring to a plurality of comments stored in the acquired comment storage unit the tag tally unit counts the number of hashtags added to each comment according to the type of the hashtags. In other words the number of appearances of each hashtag in the plurality of comments is counted. In other words the number of comments to which each of a plurality of types of hashtags e.g. soccer and kokkai is added is calculated for each hashtag type. It can be said that the comments stored in the acquired comment storage unit are acquired from the posting site server based on a user operation a screen selection operation etc. and are displayed based on the user operation.

The tag tally unit counts the number of hashtags of a comment posted within the past hour prior to the time at which the number is counted in other words the posting time and date of a comment are within the past hour of the time at which the number is counted . The tag tally unit may start a process of counting hashtags by using as a trigger the detection of an operation of displaying an information screen or the detection that a certain period of time e.g. ten minutes has passed.

The first comment displaying unit displays an all TL screen described later that displays all tweet lists hereinafter written as TL on the display . A tweet list of the second base technology means a user interface that displays comments posted to the posting site server and is a concept including a so called timeline in which the posted comments are arranged in chronological order. The second comment displaying unit displays a channel TL screen described later that displays a comment related to a specific broadcasting station and a hashtag TL screen described later that displays a comment related to a specific hashtag.

The cursor displaying unit displays a cursor for a user to select a specific area hereinafter also referred to as an area and a specific comment on the respective TL screens displayed by the first comment displaying unit and the second comment displaying unit . When depression of an up or down switch of a directional button of the controller is detected by the operation detection unit the cursor displaying unit may move the cursor over a plurality of areas and comments.

The comment element selecting unit selects a specific element character string in an area or comment focused by the cursor in accordance with the user operation to the controller . The element character string is typically a character string that is different from the main text of a comment and is for example a URL of a webpage or a character string of a hashtag. When depression of a left or right switch of the directional button of the controller is detected by the operation detection unit the comment element selecting unit may successively select an individual hashtag added to the comment focused by the cursor and highlight the selected hashtag in a predetermined mode.

The creation screen displaying unit displays on the display a tweet menu screen described later for selecting the type of a comment posting operation and a comment creating screen described later for creating a comment for posting. The creation screen displaying unit displays a software keyboard in other words a screen keyboard for entering characters for a comment on the comment creating screen.

The comment creation supporting unit identifies the genre of a program a user is viewing by referring to the program information stored in the program information storage unit . The comment creation supporting unit then selects a fixed comment corresponding to the genre of the program the user is viewing in accordance with a correspondence relationship between program genres and fixed comments stored in the fixed comment storage unit .

The input comment setting unit sets a character which is selected by the user through the software keyboard displayed on the comment creating screen in a comment creating area of the comment creating screen. When a fixed comment is selected by the user the input comment setting unit automatically sets the selected fixed comment in the comment creating area.

When the display of an information screen described later is instructed by the user the frequently appearing tag displaying unit identifies the top eight hashtags hereinafter also referred to as frequently appearing tags with respect to the number of appearances of respective hashtags counted by the tag tally unit . The frequently appearing tag displaying unit displays each of the frequently appearing tags in a frequently appearing tag display area of the information screen along with the number of appearances in a plurality of comments.

Referring back to when the display of the information screen described later is instructed by the user the regional information displaying unit acquires the number of viewing users which is the number of users viewing a program of each broadcasting station in each region from the indicator acquisition unit . Therefore the viewer tally unit of the information management server acquires the information of the program the user is viewing along with the information indicating the broadcasting station from the information processing apparatus and counts the number of the viewing users for each broadcasting station in each region. The indicator acquisition unit of the information processing apparatus acquires the number of the viewing users of each broadcasting station in each region and provides the number of the viewing users to the regional information displaying unit . The regional information displaying unit displays in a broadcasting station specific viewing status displaying area in the information screen the number of the viewing users of each broadcasting station in each region.

An explanation is given of the operation of the above configuration in the following. shows an exemplary image display screen as displayed and corresponds to . As described in the first base technology the program image acquisition unit acquires from the tuner the image of a single program selected by a user from among a plurality of programs being broadcast by a plurality of broadcasting stations and the program image displaying unit displays the program image on the image display screen in accordance with the image information. Control icons of the second base technology include a live function icon . When the live function icon is selected by the user on the image display screen a live function explained in the following flowchart is started.

The first comment displaying unit acquires a comment to which the hashtag of each broadcasting station is added that is stored in the acquired comment storage unit . As the number of posted comments to which a hashtag of a certain broadcasting station is added increases the first comment displaying unit determines the scroll speed in displaying the posted comment of the broadcasting station to be faster. In other words the first comment displaying unit determines scroll speed such that the scroll speed for the posted comments for a broadcasting station with relatively more posted comments is faster than the scroll speed for the posted comments for a broadcasting station with relatively less posted comments S . For example the first comment displaying unit may store a correspondence relationship between the range of the number of posted comments 0 to 20 posted comments 20 to 40 posted comments . . . 80 to 100 posted comments and scroll speed in advance and may determine the scroll speed for the posted comments for each broadcasting station in reference to the correspondence relationship. The first comment displaying unit displays an all TL screen for the scroll display of the posted comments for each broadcasting station in parallel with one another S .

Upon the detection that a predetermined waiting period e.g. one minute has passed the comment acquisition unit acquires the posted comments for each broadcasting station from the posting site server again not shown in . In the second base technology it is assumed that a maximum of 100 posted comments are acquired for each broadcasting station in reverse chronological order of the posting time and date. The first comment displaying unit sequentially changes the scroll speed for the posted comments according to the transition of the number of comments acquired by the comment acquisition unit . In other words the scroll speed is decreased as the number of comments decreases and the scroll speed is increased as the number of comments increases. Using a user account in a posting site that is recorded in advance in the information processing apparatus the comment acquisition unit acquires a comment that is associated with the user account in the posting site server .

The first comment displaying unit displays the comments posted for a program being broadcast by each broadcasting station in parallel with one another in an area for the broadcasting station provided in a broadcasting station specific comment area . In other words the first comment displaying unit displays the comments posted for a program being broadcast by a certain broadcasting station independently from the comment posted for a program being broadcast by another broadcasting station.

This allows real time comments from other viewers provided for a program the user is viewing to be sequentially presented to the user. Also real time comments from viewers provided for programs the user is not viewing can be also presented to the user at the same time. Viewer s comments tweets are true opinions of viewers that cannot be learned from information shown in program guides. Therefore a user can check both comments for a program the user is viewing and comments for other programs at the same time so as to select a program to view. An innovative viewing experience can be provided to a user that makes the user aware of a loose connection with other viewers by sequentially presenting the user the thoughts of the moment of people viewing various programs at around the same time.

The first comment displaying unit displays the comments posted for a program of each broadcasting station in an area provided for the broadcasting station in the broadcasting station specific comment area while sequentially scrolling the posted comments to the left in reverse chronological order of the posting time and date at a speed that corresponds to the number of postings. This allows the user to intuitively know programs with a large number of comments which are typically programs for which many viewers are excited and also supports the user to select a program for which many viewers are excited.

The first comment displaying unit excludes a hashtag and a URL character strings that are added to each comment from being displayed in other words hides the hashtag and the URL character strings when displaying a posted comment. For example after acquiring a comment from the acquired comment storage unit the first comment displaying unit may delete hashtag and URL character strings from the comment so as to display the comment. More specifically upon the detection of a predetermined character string e.g. that indicates the start of a hashtag in a comment character string the first comment displaying unit may delete a part of the comment character string that starts with the predetermined character string and ends with a predetermined character string e.g. a blank character or a space that indicates the end of the hashtag. Similarly upon the detection of a predetermined character string e.g. http that indicates the start of a URL the first comment displaying unit may delete a part of the comment character string that starts with the predetermined character string and ends with a predetermined character string e.g. a blank character or a space that indicates the end of the URL.

The broadcasting station specific comment area includes a plurality of broadcasting station areas. Although a comment display area of each broadcasting station is relatively small only the main text of each comment can be displayed according to this form. This allows a comment to be efficiently displayed while keeping the essential part of the comment.

The first comment displaying unit acquires the number of viewers of a program being broadcast by each broadcasting station from the indicator acquisition unit and displays the acquired number of the viewers in a comment display area of the broadcasting station. The first comment displaying unit may highlight the area of a broadcasting station which corresponds to a program being viewed by the user being displayed on the image display screen in a predetermined mode such as displaying the area in a different background color from that of other areas. This supports the user to easily distinguish the program currently being viewed from other programs.

The first comment displaying unit scroll displays a comment associated with a user account in a user comment area . An information area is an area selected to transition the screen to an information screen described later . A current software tag area is an area selected to transition the screen to a comment to which a hashtag which indicates a program viewing software is added that is a comment display screen regarding the program viewing software.

The cursor displaying unit displays a cursor for selecting any one of the areas of respective broadcasting stations in the broadcasting station specific comment area the user comment area the broadcasting station specific comment area and the user comment area on the all TL screen . The user can display an arbitrary screen by selecting a specific area by operating the cursor via the controller .

Referring back to when any of the broadcasting station areas in the broadcasting station specific comment area of the all TL screen is selected by the user Y in S the comment acquisition unit transmits a comment acquisition request to the posting site server by using as a search key a hashtag that is preset to the broadcasting station hereinafter also referred to as a selected broadcasting station selected by the user. The comment acquisition unit then acquires a comment to which the hashtag of the selected broadcasting station is added from the posting site server S and stores the comment in the acquired comment storage unit S .

The second comment displaying unit acquires a comment to which the hashtag of the selected broadcasting station is added that is stored in the acquired comment storage unit . The second comment displaying unit then displays a channel TL screen that displays a list of comments in the order of the posting time and date S . The channel TL screen is a so called timeline related to the selected broadcasting station. When a certain period of time e.g. one minute has passed Y in S the step goes back to S and a comment is acquired again. The second comment displaying unit updates a tweet list timeline on the channel TL screen. In other words when a new comment is acquired by the comment acquisition unit the second comment displaying unit displays the new comment on the channel TL screen while hiding the old comment.

When a user operation to the controller is detected during the display of the channel TL screen the cursor displaying unit displays a cursor . The cursor is moved in a vertical direction for each comment in accordance with an up down operation to the directional button of the controller . The comment element selecting unit successively leaves the hashtag and the URL character string selected that are described in a comment focused by the cursor in accordance with a left right operation to the directional button of the controller . When a predetermined operation e.g. depression of a circular button by the user is detected while the hashtag is being selected the second comment displaying unit displays a hashtag TL screen that includes a tweet list related to the hashtag.

Referring back to when an operation of moving the cursor is detected Y in S before the certain period of time has passed on the channel TL screen N in S the second comment displaying unit temporarily stops the update of the timeline on the channel TL screen S . In accordance with a cursor operation by the user the cursor displaying unit moves the cursor and the second comment displaying unit scroll displays the timeline S . For example when a previously posted comment that is hidden on the channel TL screen is selected by the cursor the second comment displaying unit scrolls the timeline for each comment and redisplays the comment selected by the cursor .

When no operation of moving the cursor is detected before a certain period of time e.g. 30 seconds has passed Y in S the cursor displaying unit hides the cursor and the second comment displaying unit resumes the update of the timeline on the channel TL screen S . When the operation of moving the cursor is detected within the certain period of time N in S the step goes back to S. When there is no operation of moving the cursor at all N in S S to S are skipped. The same operations as those in S to S also apply to the display of a hashtag TL screen except that a specific hashtag is used as a search key.

As described above the latest posted comment can be presented to the user by sequentially acquiring the latest posted comment and then by sequentially updating the channel TL screen . On the other hand while a cursor operation a comment selection operation etc. is given by the user the update of the channel TL screen is prevented so that the operation by the user is prevented from being interfered by the update of the channel TL screen . Generally compared to a mouse of a PC etc. there is more constraint on a selection operation and the degree of interference to a user operation by the update of the channel TL screen is larger in the controller e.g. a game controller that operates the information processing apparatus . Therefore compared to when a mouse is used as operation means the user friendliness can be greatly improved by preventing the update of the channel TL screen during an operation by the user.

Referring back to when any one of the selections a tweet citation and fixed comment is selected on the tweet menu screen the creation screen displaying unit displays a comment creating screen S . When a fixed comment is selected on the tweet menu screen Y in S the input comment setting unit automatically sets the selected fixed comment in the comment creating area of the comment creating screen prior to an operation of entering a comment by the user S . When a fixed comment is not selected N in S S is skipped. Upon the receipt of a request for entering a comment in the comment creating area from the user the creation screen displaying unit displays on the comment creating screen an image showing a keyboard in which various keys are arranged S . When a key of the keyboard is selected by the user the input comment setting unit sets a character that corresponds to the key in the comment creating area S .

The cursor displaying unit displays a cursor on the comment creating screen . When the user presses down a predetermined button e.g. a circular button after focusing on the comment creating area by the cursor the creation screen displaying unit displays a software keyboard. The user enters an arbitrary character in the comment creating area by operating the cursor to select an arbitrary key on the software keyboard.

As described above a fixed comment appropriate for a program that is being viewed can be extracted from a plurality of fixed comments and presented to the user by storing a correspondence relationship between program genres and fixed comments in advance so as to select a fixed comment that corresponds to the genre of the program the user is viewing. Also by automatically setting the fixed comment selected by the user in the comment creating area user s burden in creating a comment can be reduced. Such a configuration is particularly suitable for when a software keyboard is used as means for entering characters. In other words when a software keyboard instead of a hardware keyboard is used in entering characters user s burden in entering characters is generally increased. Therefore by allowing the user to select a fixed phrase the number of characters entered by the user can be reduced and the user s burden can be thus reduced greatly.

Referring back to when the posting button is pressed down on the comment creating screen Y in S the comment posting unit acquires a character string that is entered in the comment creating area. The comment posting unit then sets a final posting comment by adding to the character string hashtags indicating a program viewing software a broadcasting station of a program being displayed on the image display screen a service ID of the program and an event ID respectively. The comment posting unit registers the data of the final posting comment by transmitting the data to the posting site server S . When depression of the posting button is not detected N in S S and S are skipped. When an operation of displaying the tweet menu is not detected N in S S to S are skipped. When none of the broadcasting stations in the broadcasting station specific comment area is selected on the all TL screen N in S of S to S are skipped.

As described above by automatically setting an appropriate hashtag for a user viewing a program all the user needs to do is to enter the main text of a comment and the user s burden can be reduced. As described previously when a software keyboard is used as means for entering characters the user s burden can be further reduced.

When the information area is selected by the user on the all TL screen Y in S the tag tally unit refers to the data of comments posted within the past hour from among comments stored in the acquired comment storage unit so as to count the number of hashtags added to each comment according to a type of the hashtags and identifies the number of appearances of each hashtag S . In addition to displaying the information screen the frequently appearing tag displaying unit displays the top eight frequently appearing tags in a part of the area of the information screen along with the number of appearances thereof S . In addition to these the regional information displaying unit displays in a part of the area of the information screen the number of viewing users of each broadcasting station in each region S . A predetermined hashtag e.g. TVAA of etc. that indicates a broadcasting station is excluded from being counted by the tag tally unit or selected as a frequently appearing tag by the frequently appearing tag displaying unit .

Referring back to when a frequently appearing tag is selected on the information screen Y in S the comment acquisition unit transmits a comment acquisition request to the posting site server by using as a search key the frequently appearing tag selected by the user. The comment acquisition unit then acquires a comment to which the frequently appearing tag is added from the posting site server S . The second comment displaying unit displays a hashtag TL screen that displays a list of comments to which frequently appearing tags acquired by the comment acquisition unit are added in the order of the posting time and date S . When a frequently appearing tag is not selected by the user N in S S and S are skipped. When the information area is not selected on the all TL screen N in S S to S are skipped. When a live function is not selected to begin with N in S of S and all the subsequent steps are skipped.

As described above by displaying a frequently appearing tag of a posted comment that is acquired in accordance with a user operation a hashtag added to many comments can be presented to a user. For example regarding comments posted for a relay program of a soccer game there are often more comments to which a hashtag such as soccer is added than comments to which the hashtag of the broadcasting station is added. In other words displaying a timeline of comments to which a hashtag such as soccer is added is often more useful for a user than displaying a timeline of comments to which the hashtag of the broadcasting station is added. Presenting a user a frequently appearing tag allows a candidate for a hashtag which is useful to the user viewing a program to be presented supporting the user to reach a useful timeline. Since comments acquired from the posting site server in accordance with a user operation are the population for counting hashtags a frequently appearing tag related to comments the user is interested in can be efficiently presented to the user.

Described above is an explanation of the second form of the base technology. This form is intended to be illustrative only and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications to constituting elements and processes could be developed and that such modifications are also within the scope of the second base technology. An exemplary variation of the second base technology is shown in the following.

A first exemplary variation is now described in detail. Although no particular reference is made in the above second base technology when the cursor displaying unit hides the cursor since no operation on the cursor is detected for a certain period of time on the channel TL screen the second comment displaying unit may gradually updates the timeline displayed at that point for each comment. For example the second comment displaying unit may hide the oldest comment in the timeline displayed at that point and add a new comment to be displayed which is posted subsequently to the latest comment in the timeline. The second comment displaying unit may successively display newly posted comments in the timeline by repeating the replacement. More specifically when comments are arranged in descending order of the posting time and date in the timeline the second comment displaying unit may gradually scroll up the comments from the display position of a cursor at the time the cursor is made hidden so as to successively display newly posted comments. According to this variation new comments are successively displayed starting from a comment selected by a user facilitating the user to find comments e.g. comments such as replies and citations that are related to the comment selected by the user. The variation can also facilitate the user to reselect a comment selected before a cursor is made hidden.

Further the second comment displaying unit may replace an old comment with a new comment in the timeline at a higher speed or scroll up the timeline at a higher speed as the number of comments that are periodically acquired by the comment acquisition unit increases. This variation allows the user to more easily know whether the number of comments posted for a program is large or small in an intuitive manner and also allows new comments to be more easily presented to the user in a quick manner.

A second exemplary variation is now described in detail. Although no particular reference is made in the above second base technology a plurality of genres may be assigned to each program with regard to program information stored in the program information storage unit . For example a genre news an d a genre variety may be assigned to a talk show program. The fixed comment storage unit may store a plurality of genres in association with the same fixed comment. For example both the genre news and the genre variety may be associated with the same fixed comment that s funny. When the comment creation supporting unit selects a plurality of fixed comments which are all identical for a program to which a plurality of genres are assigned the creation screen displaying unit may hide either of the fixed comments on the tweet menu screen . According to this variation a situation can be prevented where a task of checking fixed comments by the user becomes unnecessarily complicated due to a plurality of identical fixed comments being displayed on the tweet menu screen and where the user s burden is increased as a result.

The recording apparatus periodically acquires program information of terrestrial digital television broadcast BS broadcast and CS broadcast through a tuner not shown in . Then the recording apparatus causes a predetermined display to display individual program guides. The recording apparatus in the embodiment updates the program guides after every 12 hours. Therefore the recording apparatus acquires program information through the tuner not shown at least once for every 12 hours.

Although the information processing apparatus of the embodiment acquires program information stored in the recording apparatus the information processing apparatus that provides program information to the information processing apparatus is not limited to any of the recording apparatus . For example in place of the recording apparatus a different program viewing apparatus or AV apparatus for example a television set an HDD recorder or a DVD recorder may naturally be connected to the information processing apparatus and provide program information to the information processing apparatus .

The recording information acquisition unit acquires recording information of a recorded content locally stored in the recording information storage unit in the information processing apparatus . The recording information acquisition unit further acquires recording information of recorded contents stored in a plurality of recording apparatus connected to the information processing apparatus through a network such as a DLNA via the communication processing unit in the information processing apparatus . As a result the recording information acquisition unit acquires all recording information of recorded contents stored in any apparatus without distinguishing the apparatus in which the recorded contents are stored.

The content classification unit analyzes program names included in the recording information acquired by the recording information acquisition unit and sets recorded contents in which programs whose program names include phrases related to each other are recorded as one group. As a result the recorded contents are grouped without distinction of the apparatus in which they are stored. Details of the manner of determination of a phrase that is utilized upon grouping of recorded contents are hereinafter described.

The group name determination unit determines for each of the groups of the recorded contents grouped by the content classification unit a title of the group based on phrases used upon grouping. The group name determination unit may determine for example one of the phrases themselves used upon grouping as the title of the group. Alternatively a set of a serial number allocated uniquely to each group and the phrase may be determined as the title of the group.

The list displaying unit outputs group names determined by the group name determination unit to the display processing unit so that all group names are displayed in a list on a single interface.

The selection unit accepts selection of one of the group names displayed by the list displaying unit from the user through the operation detection unit . The list displaying unit additionally displays program names of programs recorded in recorded contents included in the group accepted from the user by the selection unit in a list on the single interface. The list displaying unit displays together with the program names of the programs recorded in the recorded contents included in the group corresponding to the selected group name also information of recording apparatus in which the recorded contents are stored in a list. The continuous playback unit causes the playback processing unit to sequentially play back the recorded contents included in the group corresponding to the group name accepted by the selection unit .

If the user selects the title through the selection unit then the list displaying unit additionally displays recorded contents included in the group on the user interface. shows a manner in which a program name and another program name included in the group titled YYY case file are displayed. For example the program name is YYY case file episode apparatus and the list displaying unit simultaneously displays also information of the apparatus in which the recorded content is stored.

In this manner the list displaying unit handles all recorded contents equally without distinguishing them by the locations where the recorded contents are stored. Consequently all program names of programs recorded in the recorded contents are displayed in a list on a single user interface. If the recording apparatus is connected through the LAN then the user of the information processing apparatus according to the embodiment can view a recorded content on the single user interface without paying attention to in which one of the recording apparatus the recorded content is stored.

Referring back to a character string that configures a program name is configured from a phrase useful for grouping programs and a character or characters hereinafter referred to as exclusion character that is insignificant when programs are grouped or may possibly make an obstruction to appropriate grouping. For example it is assumed that a certain program name is Great Adventure of ABC The Final Battle of ABC PART 2. At this time is a character string composed of exclusion characters. Meanwhile such characters as space character space tab and so forth and are separates punctuations for separating Great Adventure of ABC Final Battle of ABC and so forth which are useful phrases for grouping programs from each other. In other words a separate is a character which serves as a punctuation between a plurality of phrases existing in a program name.

Thus upon determination of a phrase to be used for grouping of recorded contents by the content classification unit the phrase determination database stores character strings to be excluded from program names and separates between phrases existing in the program names. Here as an example of an exclusion character string such character strings as free 5.1 and so forth are listed. Further if particular examples of a separate are enumerated then they are vol X vol. X PART X PART. X X hours Xth day guest season X special double byte space one byte space first half second half last part day episode chapter X section day game and so forth.

In the following a procedure for phrase determination by the content classification unit is described.

The content classification unit converts an acquired program name from double byte into one byte. When an ARIB character developed ARIB characters that are not configured from a single character like new or another character string that appears frequently and is not a decoration for a program name and hence is insignificant is positioned at the top of the title the content classification unit deletes the character or character string. In other cases the content classification unit replaces the character or character string into a space. Further the content classification unit collects more than one contiguous one byte space into a single space.

Then if an episode number for example exists at the top of the program name then the content classification unit moves the episode number to the tail of the program name. The content classification unit further determines whether or not the program name includes an episode number. If it is determined that the program name includes an episode number then the content classification unit determines part immediately preceding to the episode number as a frame. Further if an episode number is included and a bracket like or does not exist in the part immediately preceding to the episode number then the content classification unit determines the immediately preceding part as a phrase.

The content classification unit excludes the exclusion characters stored in the phrase determination database from the program name. Then if the content classification unit finds out from within the remaining character string a character string punctuated by a separate and having a length equal to or greater than an effective length or a character string having more than a predetermined number of characters which is liable to be unique then the content classification unit produces the character string as a phrase. If the character string punctuated by a separate remains within the effective length then the content classification unit searches for a next separate. The content classification unit carries out forward match comparison between produced phrases and determines when the phrases match each other that the recorded contents in which the programs are recorded belong to the same group. The content classification unit allocates a same group ID to phrases regarded as belonging to the same group but allocates a unique group ID to each of different phrases.

Since the content classification unit carries out forward match comparison for example such a situation that a program name of XXX entateimento 1 and XXX entateinmento 2 katakana character expression expression in Roman leltters are not regarded as the same program depending upon the presence or absence of the character n may possibly occur. Further for example from every week drama title A new program and every week drama title A episode 2 different phrases are produced depending upon whether or not an episode number is included. In the example given above the phrase of the former is every week drama while the phrase of the latter is every week drama title A and as a result they are allocated to different groups.

In order to deal with such problems as described above the content classification unit executes a requote process. The requote process is a process of carrying out comparing phrases produced once and associated with a group and an inputted group name with each other and allocating the group newly. The content classification unit successively compares the inputted program name and those phrases whose one character at the top match each other and determines whether they exhibit match all or match of equal to or more than a predetermined number of characters with which they are considered as associated programs. Then the phrase whose match all or longest match is determined is regarded as a related group and the group ID of the phrase is allocated.

Here the predetermined number of characters is a comparison reference character number to be used as a reference for the determination of whether or not phrases coincide with each other and is for example five characters. This comparison reference character number is stored in the phrase determination database and the content classification unit reads out the comparison reference character number from the phrase determination database and executes the requote process.

Here the following three cases are exceptions. In particular i match all of one character is not regarded as match all. ii Even if forward match comparison results in failure if one is a space and a character next to the space is found to be matched then the forward match is continued with the position changed. iii If the inputted program name and the phrase during comparison for match have a space at the same position then the forward match is executed anew from the next position even if match of equal to or more than five characters is found the forward match is carried out again . If the processes described above result in no determination then the content classification unit allocates as the group ID.

By the requote process if in the example of every week drama described above two or more of every week drama are not found then every week drama title A new program is acted upon by the requote process and re allocated to every week drama title A. On the other hand if a different program name of every week drama title B is found then since also this program name is punctuated as every week drama every week drama title A new program and every week drama title B are grouped into every week drama group. Further in the example of XXX entateimento since match of ten characters which is match of equal to or more than five characters can be confirmed by the forward match XXX entateimento is re allocated to the XXX entateinmento group only when it belongs to no group namely only when the group ID of it is 0.

The recording information acquisition unit acquires recording information of a recorded content of a playback target from the recording information storage unit S . The content classification unit produces phrases from a program name included in the recording information acquired by the recording information acquisition unit S . Further the content classification unit uniquely allocates different IDs to different phrases S .

If the recording information of all of the recorded contents stored in the information processing apparatus or the recording apparatus is not acquired N in S then the processing returns to step S described above and the processes are repeated. If the recording information of all recorded contents stored in the information processing apparatus or the recording apparatus is acquired Y in S then the content classification unit produces groups of the recorded contents based on the allocated group IDs S .

The content classification unit scans the produced groups in order S . If the group being currently scanned does not include a plurality of programs N in S then the content classification unit executes a requote process S . If the group being currently scanned includes a plurality of programs Y in S then the content classification unit advances the processing to step S without executing the requote process.

If the scanning of all groups is not completed N in S then the processing returns to step S described above to repeat the processes. If the scanning of all groups is completed Y in S then the list displaying unit displays the titles of the groups grouped by the content classification unit in a list on a single user interface S . After the list displaying unit displays the titles of the groups in a list the processing in the present flowchart is ended.

Action by the configuration described above is described below. If a recorded content is added to the information processing apparatus or any of the recording apparatus according to the embodiment then the recording information acquisition unit acquires the recording information of the recorded content. The content classification unit produces a group ID of the recorded content from the recording information of the added recorded content.

If the user of the information processing apparatus uses the controller or the like to display a video operation screen then the content classification unit executes a requote process. This is because since the requote process requires satisfaction of the assumption that all program names are inputted the timing at which the user causes the video operation screen to be displayed assures the assumption.

As described above with the information processing apparatus according to the embodiment programs recorded in a plurality of recording apparatus can be managed in a centralized manner.

Described above is an explanation of the present invention based on the embodiment. The embodiment is intended to be illustrative only and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications to constituting elements and processes could be develop and that such modifications are also within the scope of the present invention.

While in the foregoing description the content classification unit carries out grouping based on a produced phrase the content classification unit may utilize a known morphological analysis when it produces a phrase. Further a word dictionary may be used in addition in the morphological analysis.

Optional combinations of the aforementioned embodiment and exemplary variations will also be within the scope of the present invention. New modes of practicing the invention created by combinations will provide the advantages of the embodiment and variations combined.

It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the function to be achieved by each constituent requirement described in the claims may be achieved by each constituting element shown in the embodiment and the variations or by a combination of the constituting elements.

The present invention relates to a data processing technology and can be applied to a technique for displaying program names of programs recorded in a plurality of recording apparatus in a list.
