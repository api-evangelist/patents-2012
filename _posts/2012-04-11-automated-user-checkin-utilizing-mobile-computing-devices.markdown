The proliferation of smart phones tablet computers and other network enabled mobile computing devices has generated demand for applications or apps that provide users with various information and or services. Apps may provide mobile computing device users with games social networking news alerts travel and or traffic related alerts etc. Many apps are available for download at central distribution server systems. For example each of the current major mobile computing device platforms APPLE I OS and GOOGLE ANDROID has a separate app distribution service i.e. the APPLE APPSTORE the ANDROID MARKET .

As the distribution and use of mobile computing device apps has become prevalent businesses have begun to generate and distribute apps for example to generate advertising revenue and or to steer potential customers towards the businesses. There is a continuing need for new mobile computing device apps. As a result mobile device users are provided with an ever increasing range of app related business and other services. There remains a need however for apps designed to provide mobile computing device users with location based information about businesses and other venues.

Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for the provision of location based venue information to mobile computing devices such as for example smart phones tablet computers etc. The mobile computing devices may be owned by and or under the control of a person referred to herein as a user . The user may initiate some searches and view results. The user may be provided with an application or app that may be executed by the user s mobile computing device. In some embodiments information about various venues may be stored at an application server system remote from the mobile computing device and provided to the user via the mobile computing device in response to user initiated and or automated searches.

Upon execution of the app the mobile computing device may obtain and present the user with location based information in many different contexts. For example in some embodiments the mobile computing device may be programmed e.g. by the app to determine a neighborhood corresponding to a location of the mobile computing device. The neighborhood is a geographic area describing the location of the mobile computing device. Neighborhoods may or may not be geographically contiguous. The location of the mobile computing device may be determined according to any suitable hardware and or software based capabilities of the device. For example the mobile computing device may determine its location using a Global Positioning System GPS of the device a compass and or gyroscope of the device a triangulated position received from a mobile telecommunications network provider a WiFi or other mobile related network identifier e.g. Internet Protocol IP address etc. In some embodiments the mobile computing device may determine its location based on input received from the user. After determining a neighborhood the mobile computing device may facilitate searches for businesses and other venues using the determined neighborhood as a search parameter. In this way results of the searches may be tailored to the user s neighborhood.

Venues may include any locations where the user may desire to travel. Venues may include businesses offering particular products or services such as for example retail stores restaurants bars auto repair shops etc. Venues may also include other locations of interest that are not formally in business including for example non profits public parks where certain events may be occurring etc. In some embodiments venues also include private residences.

According to various embodiments the app may cause the mobile computing device and application server system to generate and or display search results based on a geographic search center. The geographic search center may be determined based on a current or past location of the mobile computing device and or user input. For example the user may initiate a search for venue information and in doing so may indicate a geographic search location as a search parameter. If the search location is more than a threshold distance from a location of the mobile computing device or if the location of the mobile computing device is unavailable then the search location may be set as the geographic search center. If the search location is less than the threshold distance from the location of the mobile computing device then the location of the mobile computing device may be set as the geographic search center. In various embodiments venues returned by the search may be displayed to the user for example in order based on the distance between each venue and the geographic search center and may indicate a distance between each venue and the geographic search center. Also in some embodiments the geographic search center may be utilized as a search location for subsequent searches.

In some embodiments the app may use the neighborhood and or geographic search center as described above to provide the user of the mobile computing device with an indication of a trending venue or venues. Trending venues may be venues selected based on the activities of venue patrons. Trending venues may be identified by the application server system for example based on trending data describing venue patron activity. The trending data may be received from a location based social networking system site or service such as for example FOURSQUARE FACEBOOK PLACES GOOGLE LATITUDE or any other suitable location based social networking site that provides real time venue trending information. Venue trending information may be accessed and downloaded from the location based social networking system for example by the application server systems. In some embodiments a server system associated with the social networking system site or service may determine trending venues and send a list of trending venues to the application server system. Trending searches may be initiated automatically and or by the user. Again trending search results may be presented for example based on the distance between the displayed venues and a geographic search center.

According to various embodiments the app may also cause the mobile computing device and application server system to implement a user check in feature. For example a user may desire to indicate his or her presence at a particular venue. Some Internet based services provide users with the option to check in at a venue. Such services include for example FOURSQUARE GOOGLE CHECK INS FACEBOOK PLACES etc. A user may utilize the app and application server system to pre register to check in at a given venue even when the user is not yet present at the venue. Upon pre registration the mobile computing device may monitor its location e.g. as the user travels to the selected venue by periodically detecting its location. If the mobile computing device enters a sleep or inactive mode the app may activate the device in order to detect its location e.g. by activating the processor . When the mobile computing device is within a predetermined distance from the business it may submit a check in request to an Internet based check in service. The request may bring about a check in of the user at the business. The check in request may be sent to the application server system or in various embodiments may be sent to a third party server system implementing the Internet based check in service to which the user is signing in. Also it will be appreciated that in some embodiments the application server system itself may implement a service for which the user signs in to a business.

Various embodiments of the present inventions described herein are directed to smart phone or other mobile computing device apps that provide location based mobile services such as neighborhood based searches and pre check in for venues. Before describing such apps in more detail this disclosure first briefly describes some details about suitable mobile computing environments and devices that can use the apps. is a diagram of an environment for providing location based venue information to various mobile computing devices . The environment comprises the mobile computing devices as well as various server systems . The various devices and systems may be in communication with one another via a data network . The data network may comprise any suitable type of wired and or wireless network and in some embodiments may comprise the Internet. For example the mobile computing devices may connect to the network utilizing a mobile telecommunications network a local area network LAN a wired connection utilizing a universal serial bus USB or other communications port of the mobile computing device etc. The data network may also be and or comprise all or a portion of a mobile telecommunications network such as for example a 3G 4G or other suitable network.

The mobile devices may execute applications or apps that configure the mobile devices to request receive and display location based venue information. For example the mobile devices upon execution of one or more apps may receive search query parameters from the user generate search query parameters in some embodiments transmit search queries to the application server system receive location based venue information from the application etc. The application server system may take various forms and may provide various data and or services to the mobile computing devices . For example the application server system may be a single computer device or server. In some embodiments the application server system may comprise multiple computer devices or servers that may be at multiple geographic locations. In some embodiments the application server system may be implemented in a networked manner such as for example according to a cloud computing or software as a service SaaS model. The application server system may provide various services to the mobile computing devices including during the execution of some apps. Such services may include data and or processing services to facilitate execution of the app or apps. For example and as described in more detail below the application server system may provide location based venue information to mobile devices in response to the search queries received from the mobile devices .

In some embodiments the application server system may also provide the mobile devices with executables and or other resources for implementing various apps. Alternately some or all executables and or other app resources may be downloaded from a distinct app distribution server system which may comprise one or more servers or other computer devices and like the application server system may be implemented in a cloud or networked manner. Example distribution services include the APPLE i OS APP STORE the ANDROID MARKET etc.

The application server system may execute one or more software modules for providing venue information to the mobile computing device . A search module may implement various user initiated and or non user initiated e.g. automatic searches for venue information for example in response to search queries received from the mobile computing device . A check in module may implement the check in service utilizing information received from the mobile computing device as described herein. The application server system may store various data for providing venue information to the mobile computing device . The data may be stored for example at one or more data stores of the application server system such as disk drives arrays of disk drives tape libraries other persistent storage devices memory etc. that may be located at a single location or across multiple locations. Venue data stored at the application server system may describe various businesses and other venues including for example products and services offered for sale by different businesses attractions and or events at businesses and other venues etc. and in some embodiments neighborhoods associated with some or all of the venues. Venue data in some embodiments may be organized into a searchable database and is also referred to herein as a venue database .

The application server system may also comprise information describing neighborhoods themselves. Neighborhoods may be defined by any suitable criteria including for example geographic boundaries or lists of constituent geographic units e.g. zip codes municipalities etc. . In some embodiments neighborhood data may be broken into a small list and a large list . The small list as described above may reside on the mobile computing device and may describe neighborhoods that may be used by the mobile device and or application server system as search parameters. In some embodiments the application server system may also maintain a copy of the small list . Neighborhoods included on the small list may comprise a large enough number of businesses or other venues to provide meaningful search results in most cases. For example if there are not enough venues in a neighborhood searches using the under populated neighborhood as a search parameter will return few or no results. According to various embodiments neighborhoods on the small list may contain a threshold number of venues per unit of population density. In various example embodiments there are about 100 businesses per neighborhood. The number of businesses in a neighborhood however as well as the size of the neighborhoods themselves can be adjusted for example based on the overall size of the city including the neighborhoods the overall number of neighborhoods e.g. in a geographic region the local importance of neighborhoods etc.

Also the small list may include popular e.g. frequently searched neighborhoods. The mobile computing device may in some embodiments store a version of the small list of neighborhoods for example as described herein below. The large list may comprise additional neighborhoods e.g. neighborhoods that do not comprise enough venues to be placed on the small list . The large list may be used for various purposes as described herein. For example some venues may be located in a neighborhood that is included in the large list but not included in the small list . When such venues are returned to the mobile computing device as search results the associated neighborhood from the large list may be provided. Also in some embodiments a third list of neighborhoods may include still more neighborhoods such that all geography within a given area is a part of at least one neighborhood without regard to whether any venues are present. The third list may be used in some cases to correctly return the neighborhood of a known location in response to a free form search.

Before providing additional details of systems and methods for searching and displaying location based venue information a detailed description is provided of example hardware and software architectures for mobile computing devices that may be utilized. The mobile computing devices may include any type of mobile computer or computer device capable of executing an app. Examples of mobile computing devices may include Internet enabled mobile telephones smart phones e.g. APPLE IPHONE ANDROID based smart phones BLACKBERRY smart phones etc. tablet computers laptop computers etc. Mobile computing devices typically provide a rich set of hardware and other features that may be utilized by apps including the app for providing venue information to users.

Alternatively or additionally the mobile computing device may comprise a track ball not shown or other suitable pointing mechanism. In various embodiments the device may be powered by a battery which may be any suitable type of battery including for example a lithium ion Li Ion battery.

The device may comprise a variety of additional hardware and or software modules described below that may be made available to and or utilized by apps or may be a part of app independent native functionality of the device . A mobile telecommunications interface module may allow the device to utilize one or more mobile communications networks e.g. cellular networks according to any suitable communications technology e.g. 3G 4G etc. . For example the device may utilize a mobile communications network for voice and or data communications. In some embodiments and in some circumstances the mobile computing device may be in communication with the application server system via the mobile communications network e.g. the network may comprise the mobile communications network . The mobile telecommunications network may also provide the device with location information for example derived from triangulation. That location information may be used for example to tailor venue searches as described herein. A local area network LAN communications interface may provide a communication link between the device and a LAN. The communication link may be a wired or wireless link. For example in some embodiments the LAN communication interface may be configured to facilitate communications according to the WI FI standard. In some embodiments and in some circumstances the LAN communications interface may be utilized to communicate with the application server system e.g. the network may comprise the LAN .

A communications port facilitates direct wired communications between the mobile computing device and other devices e.g. other mobile computing devices desktop computers etc. . The communications port may be configured according to any suitable standard including for example Universal Serial Bus USB IEEE 1394 FIREWIRE etc. In addition some mobile computing devices may have an audio output module .

Accordingly many mobile computing devices will include combinations of hardware software modules different than that of the example device . For example mobile computing devices may include additional hardware software modules not shown in and or omit one or more of the hardware software modules shown in .

At the mobile computing device may receive and or generate search parameters. The search parameters may describe a desired venue or venues to be returned in a search. Search parameters may be generated automatically e.g. as described herein and or received from the user e.g. via a touchscreen trackball keyboard or other input device of the mobile computing device . The search parameters may comprise a neighborhood and or other search location determined at . At a search for venues is conducted based on the search parameters. The search may be conducted by the mobile computing device and or the application server system . For example in some embodiments the mobile computing device may comprise venue data stored at any suitable data storage location thereof. The mobile computing device may therefore perform the search by applying the search parameters to the local venue data. Also in some embodiments all or a portion of the venue data may be stored at the application server system as shown in . In this case the mobile computing device may provide the application server system with a search query comprising the search parameters. The application server system may search the business data and provide results to the mobile device .

At the mobile device may provide results of the search to the user. The results may be presented in any suitable format including for example as a graphical user interface provided on a display of the mobile computing device . In various embodiments the results may be limited to venues within a neighborhood determined at . In other embodiments the results may include venues outside of the neighborhood determined at including for example venues within a threshold distance of the neighborhood or the search location e.g. the threshold distance may be another search parameter venues in adjacent and or nearby neighborhoods etc. Also in some embodiments the results when displayed to the user may be ordered based on the neighborhood of the displayed venues e.g. venues in the geographic area may be listed first . In some embodiments a distance between each venue and the neighborhood and or search location may also be displayed.

Before taking part in the other actions of the process flow the application server system may optionally perform various preparatory actions . For example at the application server system may load available venues into a searchable database structure e.g. the business data . The searchable database structure may be configured according to any suitable database structure including for example Open Database Connectivity ODBC Structured Query Language SQL etc. At the application server system may associate all or a portion of the venues in the database with a neighborhood or neighborhoods. The application server system may determine the neighborhood to assign to particular venues based on any suitable method. For example the application server system may compare a location of each venue to the various neighborhood boundaries and or constituent geographic units stored at . In various embodiments neighborhoods assigned to venues may be selected from the large list . In some embodiments the application server system may request and or receive venue data in a form such that each venue is already associated with a neighborhood.

To initiate neighborhood detection the mobile computing device may launch the app . Upon launch of the app or after launch of the app the mobile computing device may determine if a location of the mobile computing device is available at . Determining if a location of the mobile computing device is available may comprise for example querying various functionality of the mobile computing device including for example a positioning module of the device as illustrated in and described in more detail below with respect to . If a location of the mobile computing device is available at the mobile computing device may provide the location to the application server system at . The location may be a current or real time location of the mobile computing device or a previous location as described in more detail below with respect to .

The application server system may receive the location at . At the application server system may search the venue data for venues within a threshold distance of the location . The threshold distance may be of any suitable value and in some embodiments may be one mile. In various embodiments the search at may be based on a popular category or categories of venues. For example a popular category or categories of venues may be used as a parameter or parameters for the search. Popular categories may be categories of venues for which there are a large number of venues within the threshold distance e.g. a threshold number of venues . For example if there are a large number of venues in the neighborhood of the device in a given category e.g. shoe stores then that category may be used as at least one of the popular categories. Popular categories may be determined by the application server system for each received location or in some embodiments may be pre calculated by the application server system and or received as a pre defined list. In some embodiments popular categories may be based on prior searches by the user and or other users e.g. prior searches related to a common or close neighborhood . In various embodiments multiple searches may be performed with each search returning venues in one or more of the popular categories that are within the threshold distance of the location .

Based on the venues returned by the search the application server system may determine a neighborhood location of the mobile computing device at . For example the application server system may select a first venue from the search results based on a distance between the location and a location of the first venue. In some embodiments the first venue may be the venue from the search results that is closest to the location . The neighborhood associated with the first venue may be returned as the neighborhood of the mobile computing device . In some embodiments the application server system may select a neighborhood for the mobile computing device based on an amalgam of the neighborhoods of the venues returned by the search at . For example the application server system may select the neighborhood returned by a majority and or plurality of the returned results etc. Also in some embodiments the application server system may select a neighborhood for the mobile computing device over all of the one or more popular venue categories. For example a venue closest to the location of the mobile computing device may be selected from each of the one or more categories. The neighborhood of the mobile computing device may be selected from these results in any suitable manner e.g. majority or plurality of neighborhoods of resulting venues amalgam of neighborhoods from resulting venues etc. .

The determined neighborhood of the mobile computing device may be transmitted to the mobile computing device where it may be received at . At the mobile computing device may determine whether the returned neighborhood is on the small list . If the neighborhood is on the small list then the mobile computing device may set its neighborhood equal to the returned neighborhood at . If the neighborhood is not on the small list then the mobile computing device may request that the application server system provide an additional neighborhood e.g. based on other results of the search from .

In other embodiments instead of transmitting a single neighborhood the application server system may return to the mobile computing device the venues returned by the search at including for example the neighborhoods associated with each venue. The mobile computing device may then select the first venue from the search results based on the distance between the first venue and the location of the mobile computing device as described above and determine whether the associated neighborhood is on the small list as described at . If the neighborhood is not on the small list the mobile computing device may select another venue from the search results e.g. the next closest venue to the location . Also in some cases instead of transmitting the single neighborhood the application server system may transmit a list of neighborhoods associated with the venues returned by the search at . The mobile computing device may then select an appropriate neighborhood from the list.

At the mobile computing device may determine a list of selectable neighborhoods based on the received location. For example the mobile computing device may include on the list neighborhoods within a threshold distance of the location. When the location is a region the selectable neighborhoods may include neighborhoods within the region. At the mobile computing device may provide the list of selectable neighborhoods to a user for example via a user interface. At the mobile computing device may receive from the user a selected neighborhood which may be used for example as the neighborhood described above with respect to .

At the mobile computing device may determine if any location results received from the location system or systems are within a threshold accuracy level. The threshold accuracy level may represent an accuracy level that allows the mobile computing device to perform and or facilitate location based venue searches with a reasonable degree of accuracy. For example the threshold accuracy level may be 60 meters or some other selected distance. If at least one location result is within the threshold accuracy this result may be set as the location of the mobile computing device location at . If more than one result meets the threshold accuracy the most accurate may be set as the location of the mobile computing device at . The location returned at may be considered a current or real time location of the mobile computing device .

If no results meet the threshold accuracy then the mobile computing device may determine at whether there is a prior e.g. historical mobile computing device location result within a predetermined time threshold. For example if a valid location result has been returned within the predetermined time threshold e.g. one hour the prior result e.g. a historical location may be returned as the mobile device location at . For example it may be assumed that the mobile computing device is either still sufficiently close to the prior location or that venue searches based on the prior location will provide results meaningful to the user e.g. results including venues close to the user s current location . In some embodiments the user may be notified e.g. via the display that the mobile computing device location being used is a historical location and not a current or real time location. If at there is no prior mobile device location result no result may be returned at . For example the mobile computing device may determine that no location is available.

At the mobile computing device may receive and or derive at least one search parameter. For example the search parameters may include the neighborhood selected for example as described above with respect to process flows and . Additional search parameters may be received from the user. Examples of user provided search parameters may include for example the type of business or venue to location a capability of the business or other venue e.g. a restaurant that takes Internet reservations etc. Also in some embodiments search parameters may be derived by the mobile computing device as described herein. At the mobile computing device may provide the at least one search parameter to the application server system which may receive the same at . At the application server system may search the business data based on the at least one parameter. Results of the search may be provided to the mobile computing device at . The results may be a listing of venues meeting the search parameters. Results may be presented to the user in any suitable manner including for example as a list as a map etc. An example interface for providing search results is described below with respect to . In some embodiments the application server system may provide additional information about the search results including for example address information reviews distance information etc. At the mobile computing device may display the results and any additional information to the user for example as part of a user interface.

Focusing now on sub process flow the mobile computing device may initiate a search at . The search may be an automatic category search e.g. as described above with respect to or a user initiated search based on parameters received from the user. For example a user initiated search may be instituted when the mobile computing device sends a search query to the application server system . In various embodiments the search at may be a location based search or query having a search location. The search location may be a parameter of the search for example received from the user. For example the user may specify as a search location a particular latitude and longitude a particular address etc. If the user does not specify a search location the mobile computing device and or application server system may set a default search location such as for example a previously measured location of the mobile computing device a previously determined neighborhood of the mobile computing device e.g. determined according the process flow or the process flow a prior search location etc. At the mobile computing device may determine whether its current location is available e.g. as described above with respect to the process flow . In some embodiments the device s location may not be considered available unless a current or real time location is available.

If the current location is not available then the geographic search center may be set equal to the search location at e.g. by the mobile computing device and or by the application server system . If the search location is a neighborhood then in some embodiments the geographic search center may be set equal to a geographic center of the neighborhood. If the current location is available then current location may be transmitted to the application server system . At it may be determined whether the search location is within a threshold distance e.g. 20 miles of the current location of the mobile computing device . The determination at may be made for example by either the application server system or the mobile computing device . Provided that the search location is within the threshold distance of the current location at then the current location may be set as the geographic search center at . If the search location is not within the threshold distance of the current location at then the search location may be set as the geographic search center at . In embodiments where the mobile computing device determines whether the search location is within the threshold distance of the current location the mobile computing device may also set the geographic search center and may provide the geographic search center to the application server system .

In some embodiments the application server system may return its search results with an indication for each venue of a distance between the venue and the geographic search center. At results of the search may be presented to the user on the mobile computing device organized according to the geographic search center. For example venues may be listed in order of their distance from the geographic search center and or displayed on a map around the geographic search center. The results may be organized based on the geographic search center at the application server system before download to the mobile computing device . In some embodiments however the mobile computing device may perform the organizing after receipt of the search results. In various embodiments the geographic search center may be used in subsequent searches as a search query parameter.

Referring now to sub process flow the mobile computing device may initiate an automated search for trending venues at . The search may be initiated automatically upon launch of the app . Trending venues as described above may be selected based on the activities of venue patrons. For example trending venues may be selected based on the relative and or absolute number of patrons present at the venues a relative and or absolute number of reviews or other feedback received about the venues etc. Accordingly patron activity may constitute a parameter or parameters for the trending search. Additional parameters for the search may be determined in any suitable manner. For example in some embodiments parameters may include a popular category or categories as described above with respect to the search at above. Also in some embodiments the additional parameters may comprise a search location from a prior user initiated and or automatic search. In some embodiments if there are no prior searches e.g. since launch of the app then trending venues are determined based on factors other than prior search locations as described herein.

In various embodiments the application server system may receive patron related information associated with different venues also referred to as venue trending information from a third party source including for example a social networking site such as FOURSQUARE FACEBOOK PLACES GOOGLE LATITUDE etc. In some embodiments the venue trending information may be stored in a dedicated database e.g. at the application server system . Also in some embodiments patron reviews may be found on other Internet accessible sources such as for example periodicals newspapers etc. The patron related information may be utilized by the application server system to return result venues for trending searches. Also in some embodiments trending venues may be received directly from a third party source such as a social networking site for example in response to a search request directed to the third party source by the application server system . For example the search request to the third party source may comprise the additional search parameters received from the mobile computing device as described above.

At the mobile computing device may determine whether its location is available for example as described above with respect to process flow . Again in some embodiments the location of the mobile computing device may not be considered available unless a current location is available. If no current location is available at then the geographic search center for the trending search may be set to the search location. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments there may not be a search location e.g. if there are no prior user searches . In those cases the sub process flow may terminate without providing trending venues if the current location of the mobile computing device is not available.

If the current location of the mobile computing device is available then at the mobile computing device and or the application server system may determine whether the mobile computing device location is within a threshold distance of the search location. If the mobile computing device location is not within the threshold distance of the search location at then the geographic search center for the trending search may be set to the search location at . If the mobile computing device location is within the threshold distance of the search location at then the geographic search center for the trending search may be set to the mobile computing device location at . At results of the trending search may be organized according to the geographic search center for example as set forth above with respect to . In some embodiments the results of the trending search provided to the mobile computing device may also indicate for each returned venue a distance between the returned venue and the geographic search center. Also in some embodiments the geographic search center may be used as a parameter for subsequent trending searches. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments trending searches may be performed without determining a geographic search center. For example trending searches may be performed simply based on a search location and or mobile computing device location.

Results field may list venues returned from a search e.g. search search etc. . The results field may comprise a plurality of entries with each entry corresponding to a single returned venue. The entries may be organized in the results field in any suitable way.

Various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may employ one or more electronic computer data networks to promote communication among different components transfer data or to share resources and information. Such computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and software technology that is used to interconnect the devices in the network such as optical fiber Ethernet wireless LAN HomePNA power line communication or G.hn. The computer networks may also be embodied as one or more of the following types of networks local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN virtual private network VPN storage area network SAN or global area network GAN among other network varieties.

For example a WAN computer network may cover a broad area by linking communications across metropolitan regional or national boundaries. The network may use routers and or public communication links One type of data communication network may cover a relatively broad neighborhood e.g. city to city or country to country which uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers such as telephone service providers. In another example a GAN computer network may support mobile communications across multiple wireless LANs or satellite networks.

The link layer protocols of the VPN can be tunneled through the other network. One VPN application can promote secure communications through the Internet. The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.

Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes such as network interface cards NICs or Ethernet cards repeaters bridges hubs switches routers and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and or data connections may be provided with microwave links e.g. IEEE 802.12 or fiber optics for example. A network card network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks LANs remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network WAN link between LANs and or wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and or to connect remote stations to LANs.

In various embodiments a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term switch can also include routers and bridges as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content e.g. a Web URL identifier . Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers including physical data link network or transport i.e. end to end . A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.
