This disclosure relates generally to computing devices and more particularly to remote configuration of a hardware setting on one or more target computing device s .

An administrator of a computer network may be required to run diagnostic tests e.g. stress tests on a number of computing devices. The aforementioned diagnostic tests may involve modifying hardware settings on the number of computing devices at various points in time. The administrator may have to manually interface with the individual computing devices to modify the hardware settings. The administrator may choose to use remote access software e.g. VNC to access an individual target computing device from a remote location. However the administrator may be required to have Virtual Private Network VPN network access in order to be able to configure settings on the individual target computing device utilizing the remote access software. The process involved therein may therefore be time consuming and inefficient.

The methods and systems disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects and may be executed in a form of a machine readable medium embodying a set of instructions that when executed by a machine cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

Example embodiments as described below may be used to provide a method an apparatus and or a system of remote configuration of a hardware setting on one or more target computing device s . Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments.

In one or more embodiments each of target computing devices N may have a graphics processor e.g. a Graphics Processing Unit GPU communicatively coupled to a memory e.g. a volatile memory and or a non volatile memory . also shows a central processor e.g. a Central Processing Unit CPU communicatively coupled to both memory and graphics processor e.g. to instruct graphics processor . In an alternate embodiment each of central processor and graphics processor may have a separate memory associated therewith. While graphics processor is shown as being part of each target computing device it should be noted that target computing devices e.g. desktop computers laptop computers notebook computers mobile devices such as mobile phones without graphics processors are also within the scope of the exemplary embodiments.

In one or more embodiments each target computing device may have a display unit N associated therewith configured to render data thereon. shows display unit being communicatively coupled to central processor and graphics processor for the sake of convenience. It is obvious that further processing of data from the processors e.g. central processor graphics processor may be required to convert the aforementioned data into a suitable form for rendering on display unit .

In one or more embodiments each of target computing devices may have a user interface to enable configuration of hardware settings therein. shows user interface as being communicatively coupled to central processor and graphics processor . An example of user interface may be nVIDIA s Control Panel for GPU based computing devices. Exemplary embodiments discussed herein may dispense with a need for a user e.g. user to manually utilize user interface to update hardware settings of a corresponding target computing device . In one or more embodiments the aforementioned user e.g. user may be at a remote location from target computing devices and may still be able to apply desired hardware settings on target computing devices through initiating a request therefor at a client computing device e.g. a mobile phone a desktop computer a laptop computer communicatively coupled to server computing device through another communication network e.g. different from communication network same as communication network . For the aforementioned purpose server computing device may provide a means to remotely edit hardware settings on target computing devices through various communication mechanisms such as text messages e mails and web applications. Other communications mechanisms are also within the scope of the exemplary embodiments.

In one or more embodiments server computing device may also have a processor e.g. a central processor communicatively coupled to a memory e.g. a volatile memory and or a non volatile memory . Analogous to graphics processor and or central processor of each target computing device processor may be configured to address storage locations of memory . shows processor and memory of server computing device according to one or more embodiments. In one or more embodiments memory may include instructions associated with a request processing module stored therein. The functionalities of request processing module may better be understood with reference to example communication mechanisms.

As discussed above a single user e.g. user may transmit requests associated with configuring hardware settings on a number of target computing devices . For the aforementioned purpose target computing devices may be required to be registered with request processing module .

Once the desired setting say 90 degrees and port has been selected user may be directed to yet another user interface e.g. user interface related to selecting one or more target computing devices to apply the modified setting s to. shows an example user interface as displaying All Devices as an option along with individual target computing devices e.g. Device Device Device also as options. The aforementioned one or more target computing devices or all target computing devices may be chosen from accessing a drop down list.

Upon choosing one or more target computing devices or all target computing devices to apply the modified setting s to mobile application may be configured to generate a text message e.g. a Short Messaging Service SMS message in an example Protocol Description Unit PDU format that is compatible with a mobile communication modem not shown provided in client computing device or part of a service provider utilized for transmitting the aforementioned text message.

As shown in text message may be displayed through another user interface arrived at after applying the chosen settings in user interface . Here user may have to provide the mobile number associated with client computing device . Clicking send button on user interface may transmit text message e.g. through SMS to be processed through request processing module . Returning to request processing module may be responsible for fetching converting processing and redirecting messages received through various communication mechanisms such as text messages e mails and web applications.

For the aforementioned purpose shows request processing module as including instructions associated with a text message processing module . In one or more embodiments text message processing module may be responsible for fetching text message conversion of text message from PDU format to text processing the converted text and redirecting the text to respective target computing devices . In order for quick and efficient processing text message processing module may be configured to poll server computing device for new text messages. As soon as text message is received at server computing device text message processing module may read text message from memory e.g. using AT commands of client computing device .

Text message processing module may then convert text message from PDU format to text. If the converted text is in the format of a predefined protocol the converted text may be validated and transmitted further. Based on information included in the converted text several input parameters or identifiers such as setting name setting value graphics processor port and target computing device name s may be segregated. The validated text may then be transmitted e.g. based on a network broadcast protocol to desired target computing devices as per the message details.

In one or more embodiments each target computing device may execute an application shown as part of memory but configured to execute on central processor graphics processor that exposes Application Programming Interfaces APIs to enable direct access to hardware e.g. graphics processor display unit thereof. An example application may be nVIDIA s NVAPI that allows direct access to nVIDIA GPUs and drivers across all Microsoft Windows platforms. NVAPI provides support for categories of operations that range beyond the scope of operations found in APIs such as Microsoft DirectX and OpenGL . While an application may be envisioned as being tailored to enabling direct access to proprietary hardware e.g. nVIDIA hardware third party access is also within the scope of the exemplary embodiments.

It is obvious that user may directly type text message in an appropriate format instead of text message being generated through choosing options across one or more user interfaces to initiate the configuration of hardware settings in target computing devices . The user interfaces of are merely shown for illustrative purposes.

As discussed above each target computing device may be required to be registered with request processing module prior to functioning of communication system . Further each target computing device may also be required to be registered with mobile application or any analogous application required for other communication mechanisms .

Returning to once again other communication mechanisms may be possible through request processing module . shows request processing module as including instructions associated with an e mail processing module and a web application processing module . For example instead of transmitting text message user may transmit an e mail that is processed through e mail processing module to initiate the configuration of hardware settings in one or more target computing devices . In this case client computing device may for example execute a plug in to interact with an e mail client such as Microsoft Outlook thereon. E mail processing module may validate the corresponding request and convert the e mail into a format compatible for transmission to one or more target computing devices .

In the case of initiating the configuration through a web application e.g. a web browser executing on client computing device web application processing module may process a message generated due to the initiation and convert the message into a format compatible for transmission to the one or more target computing devices . The polling of server computing device for new messages and or extraction of information associated with target computing device s and or hardware hardware setting information thereof from the converted e mail message may be analogous to the discussion corresponding to text message processing module .

Thus in one or more embodiments user may possess the capability to configure hardware settings on one or more target computing devices even when not physically present at the location of server computing device and or the one or more target computing devices . In one or more embodiments user may possess the ability to simultaneously initiate configuration of hardware settings on a number of target computing devices . Exemplary embodiments may find utility in an example scenario of user being an administrator of a computer network having to run stress tests on target computing devices overnight that require modifying hardware settings on target computing devices at various points in time. Also as discussed above configuration of hardware settings may be possible through various communication mechanisms.

It is obvious that in communication mechanisms such as text messages e mails and web applications client computing device may execute appropriate applications to enable the aforementioned communication mechanisms. Returning to once again client computing device may include a text message application an e mail application and a web application to initiate the request s .

In one or more embodiments operation may involve processing through request processing module the request to generate a validated message related to the hardware setting configuration and to extract information related to a first identifier of the one or more target computing device s a second identifier of a hardware of the one or more target computing device s to which the hardware setting is to be applied and a third identifier of the hardware setting. In one or more embodiments operation may involve redirecting the validated message to the one or more target computing device s along with the extracted information.

In one or more embodiments operation may then involve interpreting through another application e.g. application executing on the one or more target computing device s the received validated message and the extracted information to enable application of the hardware setting to the hardware of the one or more target computing device s .

Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments. For example the various devices and modules described herein may be enabled and operated using hardware circuitry firmware software or any combination of hardware firmware and software e.g. embodied in a non transitory machine readable medium . For example the various electrical structure and methods may be embodied using transistors logic gates and electrical circuits e.g. Application Specific Integrated Circuitry ASIC and or Digital Signal Processor DSP circuitry .

In addition it will be appreciated that the various operations processes and methods disclosed herein may be embodied in a machine readable medium and or a machine accessible medium compatible with a data processing system e.g. a computer device . Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
