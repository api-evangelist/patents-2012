These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the embodiments and the drawings.

All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. References to items in the singular should be understood to include items in the plural and vice versa unless explicitly stated otherwise or clear from the text. Grammatical conjunctions are intended to express any and all disjunctive and conjunctive combinations of conjoined clauses sentences words and the like unless otherwise stated or clear from the context.

The present disclosure relates to eyepiece electro optics. The eyepiece may include projection optics suitable to project an image onto a see through or translucent lens enabling the wearer of the eyepiece to view the surrounding environment as well as the displayed image. The projection optics also known as a projector may include an RGB LED module that uses field sequential color. With field sequential color a single full color image may be broken down into color fields based on the primary colors of red green and blue and imaged by an LCoS liquid crystal on silicon optical display individually. As each color field is imaged by the optical display the corresponding LED color is turned on. When these color fields are displayed in rapid sequence a full color image may be seen. With field sequential color illumination the resulting projected image in the eyepiece can be adjusted for any chromatic aberrations by shifting the red image relative to the blue and or green image and so on. The image may thereafter be reflected into a two surface freeform waveguide where the image light engages in total internal reflections TIR until reaching the active viewing area of the lens where the user sees the image. A processor which may include a memory and an operating system may control the LED light source and the optical display. The projector may also include or be optically coupled to a display coupling lens a condenser lens a polarizing beam splitter and a field lens.

Referring to an illustrative embodiment of the augmented reality eyepiece may be depicted. It will be understood that embodiments of the eyepiece may not include all of the elements depicted in while other embodiments may include additional or different elements. In embodiments the optical elements may be embedded in the arm portions of the frame of the eyepiece. Images may be projected with a projector onto at least one lens disposed in an opening of the frame . One or more projectors such as a nanoprojector picoprojector microprojector femtoprojector LASER based projector holographic projector and the like may be disposed in an arm portion of the eyepiece frame . In embodiments both lenses are see through or translucent while in other embodiments only one lens is translucent while the other is opaque or missing. In embodiments more than one projector may be included in the eyepiece .

In embodiments such as the one depicted in the eyepiece may also include at least one articulating ear bud a radio transceiver and a heat sink to absorb heat from the LED light engine to keep it cool and to allow it to operate at full brightness. There are also one or more TI OMAP4 open multimedia applications processors and a flex cable with RF antenna all of which will be further described herein.

In an embodiment and referring to the projector may be an RGB projector. The projector may include a housing a heatsink and an RGB LED engine or module . The RGB LED engine may include LEDs dichroics concentrators and the like. A digital signal processor DSP not shown may convert the images or video stream into control signals such as voltage drops current modifications pulse width modulation PWM signals and the like to control the intensity duration and mixing of the LED light. For example the DSP may control the duty cycle of each PWM signal to control the average current flowing through each LED generating a plurality of colors. A still image co processor of the eyepiece may employ noise filtering image video stabilization and face detection and be able to make image enhancements. An audio back end processor of the eyepiece may employ buffering SRC equalization and the like.

The projector may include an optical display such as an LCoS display and a number of components as shown. In embodiments the projector may be designed with a single panel LCoS display however a three panel display may be possible as well. In the single panel embodiment the display is illuminated with red blue and green sequentially aka field sequential color . In other embodiments the projector may make use of alternative optical display technologies such as a back lit liquid crystal display LCD a front lit LCD a transflective LCD an organic light emitting diode OLED a field emission display FED a ferroelectric LCoS FLCOS liquid crystal technologies mounted on Sapphire transparent liquid crystal micro displays quantum dot displays and the like.

The eyepiece may be powered by any power supply such as battery power solar power line power and the like. The power may be integrated in the frame or disposed external to the eyepiece and in electrical communication with the powered elements of the eyepiece . For example a solar energy collector may be placed on the frame on a belt clip and the like. Battery charging may occur using a wall charger car charger on a belt clip in an eyepiece case and the like.

The projector may include the LED light engine which may be mounted on heat sink and holder for ensuring vibration free mounting for the LED light engine hollow tapered light tunnel diffuser and condenser lens . Hollow tunnel helps to homogenize the rapidly varying light from the RGB LED light engine. In one embodiment hollow light tunnel includes a silvered coating. The diffuser lens further homogenizes and mixes the light before the light is led to the condenser lens . The light leaves the condenser lens and then enters the polarizing beam splitter PBS . In the PBS the LED light is propagated and split into polarization components before it is refracted to a field lens and the LCoS display . The LCoS display provides the image for the microprojector. The image is then reflected from the LCoS display and back through the polarizing beam splitter and then reflected ninety degrees. Thus the image leaves microprojector in about the middle of the microprojector. The light then is led to the coupling lens described below.

In other embodiments the eyepiece may utilize OLED displays quantum dot displays and the like that provide higher power efficiency brighter displays less costly components and the like. In addition display technologies such as OLED and quantum dot displays may allow for flexible displays and so allowing greater packaging efficiency that may reduce the overall size of the eyepiece. For example OLED and quantum dot display materials may be printed through stamping techniques onto plastic substrates thus creating a flexible display component. For example the OLED organic LED display may be a flexible low power display that does not require backlighting. It can be curved as in standard eyeglass lenses. In one embodiment the OLED display may be or provide for a transparent display.

Referring to the eyepiece may utilize a planar illumination facility in association with a reflective display where light source s are coupled with an edge of the planar illumination facility and where the planar side of the planar illumination facility illuminates the reflective display that provides imaging of content to be presented to the eye of the wearer through transfer optics . In embodiments the reflective display may be an LCD an LCD on silicon LCoS cholesteric liquid crystal guest host liquid crystal polymer dispersed liquid crystal phase retardation liquid crystal and the like or other liquid crystal technology know in the art. In other embodiments the reflective display may be a bi stable display such as electrophoretic electrofluidic electrowetting electrokinetic cholesteric liquid crystal and the like or any other bi stable display known to the art. The reflective display may also be a combination of an LCD technology and a bi stable display technology. In embodiments the coupling between a light source and the edge of the planar illumination facility may be made through other surfaces of the planar illumination facility and then directed into the plane of the planar illumination facility such as initially through the top surface bottom surface an angled surface and the like. For example light may enter the planar illumination facility from the top surface but into a 45 facet such that the light is bent into the direction of the plane. In an alternate embodiment this bending of direction of the light may be implemented with optical coatings.

In an example the light source may be an RGB LED source e.g. an LED array coupled directly to the edge of the planar illumination facility. The light entering the edge of the planar illumination facility may then be directed to the reflective display for imaging such as described herein. Light may enter the reflective display to be imaged and then redirected back through the planar illumination facility such as with a reflecting surface at the backside of the reflective display. Light may then enter the transfer optics for directing the image to the eye of the wearer such as through a lens reflected by a beam splitter to a reflective surface back through the beam splitter and the like to the eye . Although the transfer optics have been described in terms of the and it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the transfer optics may include any transfer optics configuration known including more complex or simpler configurations than describe herein. For instance with a different focal length in the field lens the beam splitter could bend the image directly towards the eye thus eliminating the curved mirror and achieving a simpler design implementation. In embodiments the light source may be an LED light source a laser light source a white light source and the like or any other light source known in the art. The light coupling mechanism may be direct coupling between the light source and the planar illumination facility or through coupling medium or mechanism such as a waveguide fiber optic light pipe lens and the like. The planar illumination facility may receive and redirect the light to a planar side of its structure through an interference grating optical imperfections scattering features reflective surfaces refractive elements and the like. The planar illumination facility may be a cover glass over the reflective display such as to reduce the combined thickness of the reflective display and the planar illumination facility . The planar illumination facility may further include a diffuser located on the side nearest the transfer optics to expand the cone angle of the image light as it passes through the planar illumination facility to the transfer optics . The transfer optics may include a plurality of optical elements such as lenses mirrors beam splitters and the like or any other optical transfer element known to the art.

In an embodiment of an optics system shows a planar illumination facility as part of a ferroelectric light wave circuit FLC including a configuration that utilizes laser light sources coupling to the planar illumination facility through a waveguide wavelength converter where the planar illumination facility utilizes a grating technology to present the incoming light from the edge of the planar illumination facility to the planar surface facing the reflective display . The image light from the reflective display is then redirected back though the planar illumination facility though a hole in the supporting structure to the transfer optics. Because this embodiment utilizes laser light the FLC also utilizes optical feedback to reduce speckle from the lasers by broadening the laser spectrum as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 265 896. In this embodiment the laser source is an IR laser source where the FLC combines the beams to RGB with back reflection that causes the laser light to hop and produce a broadened bandwidth to provide the speckle suppression. In this embodiment the speckle suppression occurs in the wave guides . The laser light from laser sources is coupled to the planar illumination facility through a multi mode interference combiner MMI . Each laser source port is positioned such that the light traversing the MMI combiner superimposes on one output port to the planar illumination facility . The grating of the planar illumination facility produces uniform illumination for the reflective display. In embodiments the grating elements may use a very fine pitch e.g. interferometric to produce the illumination to the reflective display which is reflected back with very low scatter off the grating as the light passes through the planar illumination facility to the transfer optics. That is light comes out aligned such that the grating is nearly fully transparent. Note that the optical feedback utilized in this embodiment is due to the use of laser light sources and when LEDs are utilized speckle suppression may not be required because the LEDs are already broadband enough.

In an embodiment of an optics system utilizing a planar illumination facility that includes a configuration with optical imperfections in this case a grooved configuration is shown in . In this embodiment the light source s are coupled directly to the edge of the planar illumination facility . Light then travels through the planar illumination facility and encounters small grooves A D in the planar illumination facility material such as grooves in a piece of Poly methyl methacrylate PMMA . In embodiments the grooves A D may vary in spacing as they progress away from the input port e.g. less aggressive as they progress from A to D vary in heights vary in pitch and the like. The light is then redirected by the grooves A D to the reflective display as an incoherent array of light sources producing fans of rays traveling to the reflective display where the reflective display is far enough away from the grooves A D to produce illumination patterns from each groove that overlap to provide uniform illumination of the area of the reflective display . In other embodiments there may be an optimum spacing for the grooves where the number of grooves per pixel on the reflective display may be increased to make the light more incoherent more fill but where in turn this produces lower contrast in the image provided to the wearer with more grooves to interfere within the provided image. While this embodiment has been discussed with respect to grooves other optical imperfections such as dots are also possible.

In embodiments and referring to counter ridges or anti grooves may be applied into the grooves of the planar illumination facility such as in a snap on ridge assembly . Wherein the counter ridges are positioned in the grooves A D such that there is an air gap between the groove sidewalls and the counter ridge sidewalls. This air gap provides a defined change in refractive index as perceived by the light as it travels through the planar illumination facility that promotes a reflection of the light at the groove sidewall. The application of counter ridges reduces aberrations and deflections of the image light caused by the grooves. That is image light reflected from reflective display is refracted by the groove sidewall and as such it changes direction because of Snell s law. By providing counter ridges in the grooves where the sidewall angle of the groove matches the sidewall angle of the counter ridge the refraction of the image light is compensated for and the image light is redirected toward the transfer optics .

In embodiments and referring to the planar illumination facility may be a laminate structure created out of a plurality of laminating layers wherein the laminating layers have alternating different refractive indices. For instance the planar illumination facility may be cut across two diagonal planes of the laminated sheet. In this way the grooved structure shown in is replaced with the laminate structure . For example the laminating sheet may be made of similar materials PMMA versus PMMA where the difference is in the molecular weight of the PMMA . As long as the layers are fairly thick there may be no interference effects and act as a clear sheet of plastic. In the configuration shown the diagonal laminations will redirect a small percentage of light source to the reflective display where the pitch of the lamination is selected to minimize aberration.

In an embodiment of an optics system shows a planar illumination facility utilizing a wedge configuration. In this embodiment the light source s are coupled directly to the edge of the planar illumination facility . Light then travels through the planar illumination facility and encounters the slanted surface of the first wedge where the light is redirected to the reflective display and then back to the illumination facility and through both the first wedge and the second wedge and on to the transfer optics. In addition multi layer coatings may be applied to the wedges to improve transfer properties. In an example the wedge may be made from PMMA with dimensions of mm high 10 mm width and spanning the entire reflective display have 1 to 1.5 degrees angle and the like. In embodiments the light may go through multiple reflections within the wedge before passing through the wedge to illuminate the reflective display . If the wedge is coated with a highly reflecting coating and the ray may make many reflections inside wedge before turning around and coming back out to the light source again. However by employing multi layer coatings and on the wedge such as with SiO2 Niobium Pentoxide and the like light may be directed to illuminate the reflective display . The coatings and may be designed to reflect light at a specified wavelength over a wide range of angles but transmit light within a certain range of angles e.g. theta out angles . In embodiments the design may allow the light to reflect within the wedge until it reaches a transmission window for presentation to the reflective display where the coating is then configured to enable transmission. The angle of the wedge directs light from an LED lighting system to uniformly irradiate a reflective image display to produce an image that is reflected through the illumination system. By providing light from the light source such that a wide cone angle of light enters the wedge different rays of light will reach transmission windows at different locations along the length of the wedge so that uniform illumination of the surface of the reflective display is provided and as a result the image provided to the wearer s eye has uniform brightness as determined by the image content in the image.

In embodiments the see through optics system including a planar illumination facility and reflective display as described herein may be applied to any head worn device known to the art such as including the eyepiece as described herein but also to helmets e.g. military helmets pilot helmets bike helmets motorcycle helmets deep sea helmets space helmets and the like ski goggles eyewear water diving masks dusk masks respirators Hazmat head gear virtual reality headgear simulation devices and the like. In addition the optics system and protective covering associated with the head worn device may incorporate the optics system in a plurality of ways including inserting the optics system into the head worn device in addition to optics and covering traditionally associated with the head worn device. For instance the optics system may be included in a ski goggle as a separate unit providing the user with projected content but where the optics system doesn t replace any component of the ski goggle such as the see through covering of the ski goggle e.g. the clear or colored plastic covering that is exposed to the outside environment keeping the wind and snow from the user s eyes . Alternatively the optics system may replace at least in part certain optics traditionally associated with the head worn gear. For instance certain optical elements of the transfer optics may replace the outer lens of an eyewear application. In an example a beam splitter lens or mirror of the transfer optics could replace the front lens for an eyewear application e.g. sunglasses thus eliminating the need for the front lens of the glasses such as if the curved reflection mirror is extended to cover the glasses eliminating the need for the cover lens. In embodiments the see through optics system including a planar illumination facility and reflective display may be located in the head worn gear so as to be unobtrusive to the function and aesthetic of the head worn gear. For example in the case of eyewear or more specifically the eyepiece the optics system may be located in proximity with an upper portion of the lens such as in the upper portion of the frame.

A planar illumination facility also know as an illumination module may provide light in a plurality of colors including Red Green Blue RGB light and or white light. The light from the illumination module may be directed to a 3LCD system a Digital Light Processing DLP system a Liquid Crystal on Silicon LCoS system or other micro display or micro projection systems. The illumination module may use wavelength combining and nonlinear frequency conversion with nonlinear feedback to the source to provide a source of high brightness long life speckle reduced or speckle free light. Various embodiments of the invention may provide light in a plurality of colors including Red Green Blue RGB light and or white light. The light from the illumination module may be directed to a 3LCD system a Digital Light Processing DLP system a Liquid Crystal on Silicon LCoS system or other micro display or micro projection systems. The illumination modules described herein may be used in the optical assembly for the eyepiece .

One embodiment of the invention includes a system comprising a laser LED or other light source configured to produce an optical beam at a first wavelength a planar lightwave circuit coupled to the laser and configured to guide the optical beam and a waveguide optical frequency converter coupled to the planar lightwave circuit and configured to receive the optical beam at the first wavelength convert the optical beam at the first wavelength into an output optical beam at a second wavelength. The system may provide optically coupled feedback which is nonlinearly dependent on the power of the optical beam at the first wavelength to the laser.

Another embodiment of the invention includes a system comprising a substrate a light source such as a laser diode array or one or more LEDs disposed on the substrate and configured to emit a plurality of optical beams at a first wavelength a planar lightwave circuit disposed on the substrate and coupled to the light source and configured to combine the plurality of optical beams and produce a combined optical beam at the first wavelength and a nonlinear optical element disposed on the substrate and coupled to the planar lightwave circuit and configured to convert the combined optical beam at the first wavelength into an optical beam at a second wavelength using nonlinear frequency conversion. The system may provide optically coupled feedback which is nonlinearly dependent on a power of the combined optical beam at the first wavelength to the laser diode array.

Another embodiment of the invention includes a system comprising a light source such as a semiconductor laser array or one or more LEDs configured to produce a plurality of optical beams at a first wavelength an arrayed waveguide grating coupled to the light source and configured to combine the plurality of optical beams and output a combined optical beam at the first wavelength a quasi phase matching wavelength converting waveguide coupled to the arrayed waveguide grating and configured to use second harmonic generation to produce an output optical beam at a second wavelength based on the combined optical beam at the first wavelength.

Power may be obtained from within a wavelength conversion device and fed back to the source. The feedback power has a nonlinear dependence on the input power provided by the source to the wavelength conversion device. Nonlinear feedback may reduce the sensitivity of the output power from the wavelength conversion device to variations in the nonlinear coefficients of the device because the feedback power increases if a nonlinear coefficient decreases. The increased feedback tends to increase the power supplied to the wavelength conversion device thus mitigating the effect of the reduced nonlinear coefficient.

Referring to a processor e.g. a digital signal processor may provide display sequential frames for image display through a display component e.g. an LCOS display component of the eyepiece . In embodiments the sequential frames may be produced with or without a display driver as an intermediate component between the processor and the display component . For example and referring to the processor may include a frame buffer and a display interface e.g. a mobile industry processor interface MIPI with a display serial interface DSI . The display interface may provide per pixel RGB data to the display driver as an intermediate component between the processor and the display component where the display driver accepts the per pixel RGB data and generates individual full frame display data for red green and blue thus providing the display sequential frames to the display component . In addition the display driver may provide timing signals such as to synchronize the delivery of the full frames as display sequential frames to the display component . In another example and referring to the display interface may be configured to eliminate the display driver by providing full frame display data for red green and blue directly to the display component as display sequential frames . In addition timing signals may be provided directly from the display interface to the display components. This configuration may provide significantly lower power consumption by removing the need for a display driver. Not only may this direct panel information remove the need for a driver but also may simplify the overall logic of the configuration and remove redundant memory required to reform panel information from pixels to generate pixel information from frame and the like.

Suitable optical sources and include one or more LEDs or any source of optical radiation having an emission wavelength that is influenced by optical feedback. Examples of sources include lasers and may be semiconductor diode lasers. For example optical sources and may be elements of an array of semiconductor lasers. Sources other than lasers may also be employed e.g. an optical frequency converter may be used as a source . Although two sources are shown on the invention may also be practiced with more than two sources. Combiner is shown in general terms as a three port device having ports and . Although ports and are referred to as input ports and port is referred to as a combiner output port these ports may be bidirectional and may both receive and emit optical radiation as indicated above.

Combiner may include a wavelength dispersive element and optical elements to define the ports. Suitable wavelength dispersive elements include arrayed waveguide gratings reflective diffraction gratings transmissive diffraction gratings holographic optical elements assemblies of wavelength selective filters and photonic band gap structures. Thus combiner may be a wavelength combiner where each of the input ports i has a corresponding non overlapping input port wavelength range for efficient coupling to the combiner output port.

Various optical processes may occur within optical frequency converter including but not limited to harmonic generation sum frequency generation SFG second harmonic generation SHG difference frequency generation parametric generation parametric amplification parametric oscillation three wave mixing four wave mixing stimulated Raman scattering stimulated Brillouin scattering stimulated emission acousto optic frequency shifting and or electro optic frequency shifting.

In general optical frequency converter accepts optical inputs at an input set of optical wavelengths and provides an optical output at an output set of optical wavelengths where the output set differs from the input set.

Optical frequency converter may include nonlinear optical materials such as lithium niobate lithium tantalate potassium titanyl phosphate potassium niobate quartz silica silicon oxynitride gallium arsenide lithium borate and or beta barium borate. Optical interactions in optical frequency converter may occur in various structures including bulk structures waveguides quantum well structures quantum wire structures quantum dot structures photonic bandgap structures and or multi component waveguide structures.

In cases where optical frequency converter provides a parametric nonlinear optical process this nonlinear optical process is preferably phase matched. Such phase matching may be birefringent phase matching or quasi phase matching. Quasi phase matching may include methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 116 468 to Miller the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Optical frequency converter may also include various elements to improve its operation such as a wavelength selective reflector for wavelength selective output coupling a wavelength selective reflector for wavelength selective resonance and or a wavelength selective loss element for controlling the spectral response of the converter.

In embodiments multiple illumination modules as described in may be associated to form a compound illumination module.

A second waveguide may be disposed such that its core is in close proximity with the core of the waveguide in optical frequency converter . As is known in the art this arrangement of waveguides functions as a directional coupler such that radiation in waveguide may provide additional radiation in optical frequency converter . Significant coupling may be avoided by providing radiation at wavelengths other than the wavelengths of forward radiation or additional radiation may be coupled into optical frequency converter at a location where forward radiation is depleted.

While standing wave feedback configurations where the feedback power propagates backward along the same path followed by the input power are useful traveling wave feedback configurations may also be used. In a traveling wave feedback configuration the feedback re enters the gain medium at a location different from the location at which the input power is emitted from.

Laser array output waveguides couple to the diode lasers in the array of diode lasers and directs the outputs of the array of diode lasers to star couplers A C. The laser array output waveguides the arrayed waveguide gratings and the optical frequency converters A C may be fabricated on a single substrate using a planar lightwave circuit and may comprise silicon oxynitride waveguides and or lithium tantalate waveguides.

Arrayed waveguide gratings comprise the star couplers A C waveguides A C and star couplers A C. Waveguides A C provide combined radiation to optical frequency converters A C and feedback radiation to star couplers A C respectively.

Optical frequency converters A C may comprise nonlinear optical NLO elements for example optical parametric oscillator elements and or quasi phase matched optical elements.

Compound laser illumination module may produce output optical radiation at a plurality of wavelengths. The plurality of wavelengths may be within a visible spectrum i.e. with a wavelength shorter than infrared and longer than ultraviolet light. For example waveguide A may similarly provide output optical radiation between about 450 nm and about 470 nm waveguide B may provide output optical radiation between about 525 nm and about 545 nm and waveguide C may provide output optical radiation between about 615 nm and about 660 nm. These ranges of output optical radiation may again be selected to provide visible wavelengths for example blue green and red wavelengths respectively that are pleasing to a human viewer and may again be combined to produce a white light output.

The waveguides A C may be fabricated on the same planar lightwave circuit as the laser array output waveguides the arrayed waveguide gratings and the optical frequency converters A C. In some embodiments the output optical radiation provided by each of the waveguides A C may provide an optical power in a range between approximately 1 watts and approximately 20 watts.

The optical frequency converter may comprise a quasi phase matching wavelength converting waveguide configured to perform second harmonic generation SHG on the combined radiation at a first wavelength and generate radiation at a second wavelength. A quasi phase matching wavelength converting waveguide may be configured to use the radiation at the second wavelength to pump an optical parametric oscillator integrated into the quasi phase matching wavelength converting waveguide to produce radiation at a third wavelength the third wavelength optionally different from the second wavelength. The quasi phase matching wavelength converting waveguide may also produce feedback radiation propagated via waveguide through the arrayed waveguide grating to the array of diode lasers thereby enabling each laser disposed within the array of diode lasers to operate at a distinct wavelength determined by a corresponding port on the arrayed waveguide grating.

For example compound laser illumination module may be configured using an array of diode lasers nominally operating at a wavelength of approximately 830 nm to generate output optical radiation in a visible spectrum corresponding to any of the colors red green or blue.

Compound laser illumination module may be optionally configured to directly illuminate spatial light modulators without intervening optics. In some embodiments compound laser illumination module may be configured using an array of diode lasers nominally operating at a single first wavelength to simultaneously produce output optical radiation at multiple second wavelengths such as wavelengths corresponding to the colors red green and blue. Each different second wavelength may be produced by an instance of laser illumination module .

The compound laser illumination module may be configured to produce diffraction limited white light by combining output optical radiation at multiple second wavelengths into a single waveguide using for example waveguide selective taps not shown .

The array of diode lasers laser array output waveguides arrayed waveguide gratings waveguides optical frequency converters and frequency converter output waveguides may be fabricated on a common substrate using fabrication processes such as coating and lithography. The beam shaping element is coupled to the compound laser illumination module by waveguides A C described with reference to .

Beam shaping element may be disposed on a same substrate as the compound laser illumination module . The substrate may for example comprise a thermally conductive material a semiconductor material or a ceramic material. The substrate may comprise copper tungsten silicon gallium arsenide lithium tantalate silicon oxynitride and or gallium nitride and may be processed using semiconductor manufacturing processes including coating lithography etching deposition and implantation.

Some of the described elements such as the array of diode lasers laser array output waveguides arrayed waveguide gratings waveguides optical frequency converters waveguides beam shaping element and various related planar lightwave circuits may be passively coupled and or aligned and in some embodiments passively aligned by height on a common substrate. Each of the waveguides A C may couple to a different instance of beam shaping element rather than to a single element as shown.

Beam shaping element may be configured to shape the output optical radiation from waveguides A C into an approximately rectangular diffraction limited optical beam and may further configure the output optical radiation from waveguides A C to have a brightness uniformity greater than approximately 95 across the approximately rectangular beam shape.

The beam shaping element may comprise an aspheric lens such as a top hat microlens a holographic element or an optical grating. In some embodiments the diffraction limited optical beam output by the beam shaping element produces substantially reduced or no speckle. The optical beam output by the beam shaping element may provide an optical power in a range between approximately 1 watt and approximately 20 watts and a substantially flat phase front.

The spatial light modulator may be configured to spatially modulate the optical beam . The spatial light modulator may be coupled to electronic circuitry configured to cause the spatial light modulator to modulate a video image such as may be displayed by a television or a computer monitor onto the optical beam to produce a modulated optical beam . In some embodiments modulated optical beam may be output from the spatial light modulator on a same side as the spatial light modulator receives the optical beam using optical principles of reflection. In other embodiments modulated optical beam may be output from the spatial light modulator on an opposite side as the spatial light modulator receives the optical beam using optical principles of transmission. The modulated optical beam may optionally be coupled into a projection lens . The projection lens is typically configured to project the modulated optical beam onto a display such as a video display screen.

A method of illuminating a video display may be performed using a compound illumination module such as one comprising multiple illumination modules a compound laser illumination module a laser illumination system or an imaging system . A diffraction limited output optical beam is generated using a compound illumination module compound laser illumination module laser illumination system or light engine . The output optical beam is directed using a spatial light modulator such as spatial light modulator and optionally projection lens .

Some options for an LCoS front light design include 1 Wedge with MultiLayer Coating MLC . This concept uses MLC to define specific reflected and transmitted angles 2 Wedge with polarized beamsplitter coating. This concept works like a regular PBS Cube but at a much shallower angle. This can be PBS coating or a wire grid film 3 PBS Prism bars these are similar to Option 2 but have a seam down the center of the panel and 4 Wire Grid Polarizer plate beamsplitter similar to the PBS wedge but just a plate so that it is mostly air instead of solid glass .

In embodiments the optical assembly includes a partially reflective partially transmitting optical element that reflects respective portions of image light from the image source and transmits scene light from a see through view of the surrounding environment so that a combined image comprised of portions of the reflected image light and the transmitted scene light is provided to a user s eye.

In another embodiment depict an alternate arrangement of the waveguide and projector in exploded view. In this arrangement the projector is placed just behind the hinge of the arm of the eyepiece and it is vertically oriented such that the initial travel of the RGB LED signals is vertical until the direction is changed by a reflecting prism in order to enter the waveguide lens. The vertically arranged projection engine may have a PBS at the center the RGB LED array at the bottom a hollow tapered tunnel with thin film diffuser to mix the colors for collection in an optic and a condenser lens. The PBS may have a pre polarizer on an entrance face. The pre polarizer may be aligned to transmit light of a certain polarization such as p polarized light and reflect or absorb light of the opposite polarization such as s polarized light. The polarized light may then pass through the PBS to the field lens . The purpose of the field lens may be to create near telecentric illumination of the LCoS panel. The LCoS display may be truly reflective reflecting colors sequentially with correct timing so the image is displayed properly. Light may reflect from the LCoS panel and for bright areas of the image may be rotated to s polarization. The light then may refract through the field lens and may be reflected at the internal interface of the PBS and exit the projector heading toward the coupling lens. The hollow tapered tunnel may replace the homogenizing lenslet from other embodiments. By vertically orienting the projector and placing the PBS in the center space is saved and the projector is able to be placed in a hinge space with little moment arm hanging from the waveguide.

Light reflected or scattered from the image source or associated optics of the eyepiece may pass outward into the environment. These light losses are perceived by external viewers as eyeglow or night glow where portions of the lenses or the areas surrounding the eyepiece appear to be glowing when viewed in a dimly lit environment. In certain cases of eyeglow as shown in the displayed image can be seen as an observable image A in the display areas when viewed externally by external viewers. To maintain privacy of the viewing experience for the user both in terms of maintaining privacy of the images being viewed and in terms of making the user less noticeable when using the eyepiece in a dimly lit environment it is preferable to reduce eyeglow. Methods and apparatus may reduce eyeglow through a light control element such as with a partially reflective mirror in the optics associated with the image source with polarizing optics and the like. For instance light entering the waveguide may be polarized such as s polarized. The light control element may include a linear polarizer. Wherein the linear polarizer in the light control element is oriented relative to the linearly polarized image light so that the second portion of the linearly polarized image light that passes through the partially reflecting mirror is blocked and eyeglow is reduced. In embodiments eyeglow may be minimized or eliminated by attaching lenses to the waveguide or frame such as the snap fit optics described herein that are oppositely polarized from the light reflecting from the user s eye such as p polarized in this case.

In embodiments the light control element may include a second quarter wave film and a linear polarizer. Wherein the second quarter wave film converts a second portion of a circularly polarized image light into linearly polarized image light with a polarization state that is blocked by the linear polarizer in the light control element so that eyeglow is reduced. For example when the light control element includes a linear polarizer and a quarter wave film incoming unpolarized scene light from the external environment in front of the user is converted to linearly polarized light while 50 of the light is blocked. The first portion of scene light that passes through the linear polarizer is linearly polarized light which is converted by the quarter wave film to circularly polarized light. The third portion of scene light that is reflected from the partially reflecting mirror has reversed circular polarization which is then converted to linearly polarized light by the second quarter wave film. The linear polarizer then blocks the reflected third portion of the scene light thereby reducing escaping light and reducing eyeglow. shows an example of a see through display assembly with a light control element in a glasses frame. The glasses cross section B shows the components of see through display assembly in a glasses frame B. Wherein the light control element covers the entire see through view seen by the user. Supporting members B and B are shown supporting the partially reflecting mirror B and the beam splitter layer B respectively in the field of view of the user s eye B. The supporting members B and B along with the light control element B are connected to the glasses frame B. The other components such as the folding mirror B and the first quarter wave film B are also connected to the supporting members B and B so that the combined assembly is structurally sound.

In an embodiment an absorptive polarizer in the optical assembly is used to reduce stray light. The absorptive polarizer may include an anti reflective coating. The absorptive polarizer may be disposed after a focusing lens of the optical assembly to reduce light passing through an optically flat film of the optical assembly. The light from the image source may be polarized to increase contrast.

In an embodiment an anti reflective coating in the optical assembly may be used to reduce stray light. The anti reflective coating may be disposed on a polarizer of the optical assembly or a retarding film of the optical assembly. The retarding film may be a quarter wave film or a half wave film. The anti reflective coating may be disposed on an outer surface of a partially reflecting mirror. The light from the image source may be polarized to increase contrast.

Referring to an image source directs image light to a beam splitter layer of the optical assembly. depicts a blow up of the image source . In this particular embodiment the image source is shown containing a light source LED Bar that directs light through a diffuser and prepolarizer to a curved wire grid polarizer where the light is reflected to an LCoS display . Image light from the LCoS is then reflected back through the curved wire grid polarizer and a half wave film to the beam splitter layer of the optical assembly .

Referring to LEDs provide unpolarized light. The diffuser spreads and homogenizes the light from the LEDs. The absorptive prepolarizer converts the light to S polarization. The S polarized light is then reflected toward the LCOS by the curved wire grid polarizer. The LCOS reflects the S polarized light and converts it to P polarized light depending on local image content. The P polarized light passes through the curved wire grid polarizer becoming P polarized image light. The half wave film converts the P polarized image light to S polarized image light.

Referring again to the beam splitter layer is a polarizing beam splitter or the image source provides polarized image light and the beam splitter layer is a polarizing beam splitter so that the reflected image light is linearly polarized light this embodiment and the associated polarization control is shown in . For the case where the image source provides linearly polarized image light and the beam splitter layer is a polarizing beam splitter the polarization state of the image light is aligned to the polarizing beam splitter so that the image light is reflected by the polarizing beam splitter. shows the reflected image light as having S state polarization. In cases where the beam splitter layer is a polarizing beam splitter a first quarter wave film is provided between the beam splitter layer and the partially reflecting mirror . The first quarter wave film converts the linearly polarized image light to circularly polarized image light shown as S being converted to CR in . The reflected first portion of image light is then also circularly polarized where the circular polarization state is reversed shown as CL in so that after passing back through the quarter wave film the polarization state of the reflected first portion of image light is reversed to P polarization compared to the polarization state of the image light provided by the image source shown as S . As a result the reflected first portion of the image light passes through the polarizing beam splitter without reflection losses. When the beam splitter layer is a polarizing beam splitter and the see through display assembly includes a first quarter wave film the light control element is a second quarter wave film and a linear polarizer . In embodiments the light control element includes a controllable darkening layer . Wherein the second quarter wave film converts the second portion of the circularly polarized image light into linearly polarized image light shown as CR being converted to S with a polarization state that is blocked by the linear polarizer in the light control element so that eyeglow is reduced.

When the light control element includes a linear polarizer and a quarter wave film incoming unpolarized scene light from the external environment in front of the user is converted to linearly polarized light shown as P polarization state in while 50 of the light is blocked. The first portion of scene light that passes through the linear polarizer is linearly polarized light which is converted by the quarter wave film to circularly polarized light shown as P being converted to CL in . The third portion of scene light that is reflected from the partially reflecting mirror has reversed circular polarization shown as converting from CL to CR in which is then converted to linearly polarized light by the second quarter wave film shown as CR converting to S polarization in . The linear polarizer then blocks the reflected third portion of the scene light thereby reducing escaping light and reducing eyeglow.

As shown in the reflected first portion of image light and the transmitted second portion of scene light have the same circular polarization state shown as CL so that they combine and are converted by the first quarter wave film into linearly polarized light shown as P which passes through the beam splitter when the beam splitter layer is a polarizing beam splitter. The linearly polarized combined light then provides a combined image to the user s eye located at the back of the see through display assembly where the combined image is comprised of overlaid portions of the displayed image from the image source and the see through view of the external environment in front of the user.

The beamsplitter layer includes an optically flat film such as the Asahi TAC film discussed herein. The beamsplitter layer may be disposed at an angle in front of a user s eye so that it reflects and transmits respective portions of image light and transmits scene light from a see through view of the surrounding environment so that a combined image comprised of portions of the image light and the transmitted scene light is provided to a user s eye. The optically flat film may be a wire grid polarizer. The optically flat film may be laminated to a transparent substrate. The optically flat film may be molded into a surface of the eyepiece. The optically flat film may be positioned at less then 40 degrees from vertical.

In an embodiment the components in collectively form an electro optic module. The angle of the optical axis associated with the display may be 10 degrees or more forward of vertical. This degree of tilt refers to how the upper part of the optics module leans forward. This allows the beamsplitter angle to be reduced which makes the optics module thinner.

The ratio of the height of the curved polarizing film to the width of the reflective image display is less than 1 1. The curve on the polarizing film determines the width of the illuminated area on the reflective display and the tilt of the curved area determines the positioning of the illuminated area on the reflective display. The curved polarizing film reflects illumination light of a first polarization state onto the reflective display which changes the polarization of the illumination light and generates image light and the curved polarizing film passes reflected image light. The curved polarizing film includes a portion that is parallel to the reflective display over the light source. The height of the image source may be at least 80 of the display active area width at least 3.5 mm or less than 4 mm.

Referring to A through C the angle of the curved wire grid polarizer controls the direction of the image light. The curve of the curved wire grid polarizer controls the width of the image light. The curve enables use of a narrow light source because it spreads the light when the light strikes it and then folds it reflects it to uniformly illuminate an image display. Image light passing back through the wire grid polarizer is unperturbed. Thus the curve also enables the miniaturization of the optical assembly.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying out one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the optical display for execution. The DSP may also include a communication interface to provide a data communication coupling to a network link that can be connected to for example a local area network LAN or to another communications network such as the Internet. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation an appropriate communication interface can send and receive electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information such as the video information to the optical display.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide an external interface to computer peripheral devices such as a monitor display TV keyboards mice memory storage e.g. external hard drive optical drive solid state memory network interface e.g. to the Internet and the like. For instance the external interface may provide direct connectivity to external computer peripheral devices e.g. connect directly to a monitor indirect connectivity to external computer peripheral devices e.g. through a central external peripheral interface device through a wired connection though a wireless connection and the like. In an example the eyepiece may be able to connect to a central external peripheral interface device that provides connectivity to external peripheral devices where the external peripheral interface device may include computer interface facilities such as a computer processor memory operating system peripheral drivers and interfaces USB port external display interface network port speaker interface microphone interface and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may be connected to the central external peripheral interface by a wired connection wireless connection directly in a cradle and the like and when connected may provide the eyepiece with computational facilities similar to or identical to a personal computer.

The frame is in a general shape of a pair of wrap around sunglasses. The sides of the glasses include shape memory alloy straps such as nitinol straps. The nitinol or other shape memory alloy straps are fitted for the user of the augmented reality eyepiece. The straps are tailored so that they assume their trained or preferred shape when worn by the user and warmed to near body temperature. In embodiments the fit of the eyepiece may provide user eye width alignment techniques and measurements. For instance the position and or alignment of the projected display to the wearer of the eyepiece may be adjustable in position to accommodate the various eye widths of the different wearers. The positioning and or alignment may be automatic such as though detection of the position of the wearer s eyes through the optical system e.g. iris or pupil detection or manual such as by the wearer and the like.

In one embodiment the controls of the noise cancelling earbuds have an automatic gain control for very fast adjustment of the cancelling feature in protecting the wearer s ears.

A detailed and assembled view of the components of the projector discussed above may be seen in . This view depicts how compact the micro projector is when assembled for example near a hinge of the augmented reality eyepiece. Microprojector includes a housing and a holder for mounting certain of the optical pieces. As each color field is imaged by the optical display the corresponding LED color is turned on. The RGB LED light engine is depicted near the bottom mounted on heat sink . The holder is mounted atop the LED light engine the holder mounting light tunnel diffuser lens to eliminate hotspots and condenser lens . Light passes from the condenser lens into the polarizing beam splitter and then to the field lens . The light then refracts onto the LCoS liquid crystal on silicon chip where an image is formed. The light for the image then reflects back through the field lens and is polarized and reflected 90 through the polarizing beam splitter . The light then leaves the microprojector for transmission to the optical display of the glasses.

In embodiments the system may utilize an optical system that is able to generate a monochrome display to the wearer which may provide advantages to image clarity image resolution frame rate and the like. For example the frame rate may triple over an RGB system and this may be useful in a night vision and the like situation where the camera is imaging the surroundings where those images may be processed and displayed as content. The image may be brighter such as be three times brighter if three LEDs are used or provide a space savings with only one LED. If multiple LEDs are used they may be the same color or they could be different RGB . The system may be a switchable monochrome color system where RGB is used but when the wearer wants monochrome they could either choose an individual LED or a number of them. All three LEDs may be used at the same time as opposed to sequencing to create white light. Using three LEDs without sequencing may be like any other white light where the frame rate goes up by a factor of three. The switching between monochrome and color may be done manually e.g. a physical button a GUI interface selection or it may be done automatically depending on the application that is running. For instance a wearer may go into a night vision mode or fog clearing mode and the processing portion of the system automatically determines that the eyepiece needs to go into a monochrome high refresh rate mode.

In an embodiment the interactive head mounted eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which a user views a surrounding environment and displayed content wherein the optical assembly includes a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment a freeform optical waveguide enabling internal reflections and a coupling lens positioned to direct an image from an optical display such as an LCoS display to the optical waveguide. The eyepiece further includes one or more integrated processors for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source such as a projector facility for introducing the content to the optical assembly. In embodiments where the image source is a projector the projector facility includes a light source and the optical display. Light from the light source such as an RGB module is emitted under control of the processor and traverses a polarizing beam splitter where it is polarized before being reflected off the optical display such as the LCoS display or LCD display in certain other embodiments and into the optical waveguide. A surface of the polarizing beam splitter may reflect the color image from the optical display into the optical waveguide. The RGB LED module may emit light sequentially to form a color image that is reflected off the optical display. The corrective element may be a see through correction lens that is attached to the optical waveguide to enable proper viewing of the surrounding environment whether the image source is on or off. This corrective element may be a wedge shaped correction lens and may be prescription tinted coated or the like. The freeform optical waveguide which may be described by a higher order polynomial may include dual freeform surfaces that enable a curvature and a sizing of the waveguide. The curvature and the sizing of the waveguide enable its placement in a frame of the interactive head mounted eyepiece. This frame may be sized to fit a user s head in a similar fashion to sunglasses or eyeglasses. Other elements of the optical assembly of the eyepiece include a homogenizer through which light from the light source is propagated to ensure that the beam of light is uniform and a collimator that improves the resolution of the light entering the optical waveguide.

In embodiments the prescription lens may be mounted on the inside of the eyepiece lens or on the outside. In some embodiments the prescription power may be divided into prescription lenses mounted on the outside and inside of the eyepiece lens. In embodiments the prescription correction is provided by corrective optics that cling to eyepiece lens or a component of the optical assembly such as the beamsplitter such as through surface tension. Suitable optics may be provided by 3M s Press On Optics which are available at least as Prisms a.k.a. Fresnel Prisms Aspheric Minus Lenses Aspheric Plus Lenses and Bifocal Lenses. The corrective optics may be a user removable and replaceable diopter correction facility adapted to be removably attached in a position between the user s eye and the displayed content such that the diopter correction facility corrects the users eyesight with respect to the displayed content and the surrounding environment. The diopter correction facility may be adapted to mount to the optical assembly. The diopter correction facility may be adapted to mount to the head mounted eyepiece. The diopter correction facility may mount using a friction fit. The diopter correction facility may mount using a magnetic attachment facility. The user may select from a plurality of different diopter correction facilities depending on the user s eyesight.

Referring to the image light which may be polarized and collimated may optionally traverse a display coupling lens which may or may not be the collimator itself or in addition to the collimator and enter the waveguide . In embodiments the waveguide may be a freeform waveguide where the surfaces of the waveguide are described by a polynomial equation. The waveguide may be rectilinear. The waveguide may include two reflective surfaces. When the image light enters the waveguide it may strike a first surface with an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle above which total internal reflection TIR occurs. The image light may engage in TIR bounces between the first surface and a second facing surface eventually reaching the active viewing area of the composite lens. In an embodiment light may engage in at least three TIR bounces. Since the waveguide tapers to enable the TIR bounces to eventually exit the waveguide the thickness of the composite lens may not be uniform. Distortion through the viewing area of the composite lens may be minimized by disposing a wedge shaped correction lens along a length of the freeform waveguide in order to provide a uniform thickness across at least the viewing area of the lens . The correction lens may be a prescription lens a tinted lens a polarized lens a ballistic lens and the like mounted on the inside or outside of the eyepiece tense or in some embodiments mounted on both the inside and outside of the eyepiece lens.

In some embodiments while the optical waveguide may have a first surface and a second surface enabling total internal reflections of the light entering the waveguide the light may not actually enter the waveguide at an internal angle of incidence that would result in total internal reflection. The eyepiece may include a mirrored surface on the first surface of the optical waveguide to reflect the displayed content towards the second surface of the optical waveguide. Thus the mirrored surface enables a total reflection of the light entering the optical waveguide or a reflection of at least a portion of the light entering the optical waveguide. In embodiments the surface may be 100 mirrored or mirrored to a lower percentage. In some embodiments in place of a mirrored surface an air gap between the waveguide and the corrective element may cause a reflection of the light that enters the waveguide at an angle of incidence that would not result in TIR.

In an embodiment the eyepiece includes an integrated image source such as a projector that introduces content for display to the optical assembly from a side of the optical waveguide adjacent to an arm of the eyepiece. As opposed to prior art optical assemblies where image injection occurs from a top side of the optical waveguide the present disclosure provides image injection to the waveguide from a side of the waveguide. The displayed content aspect ratio is between approximately square to approximately rectangular with the long axis approximately horizontal. In embodiments the displayed content aspect ratio is 16 9. In embodiments achieving a rectangular aspect ratio for the displayed content where the long axis is approximately horizontal may be done via rotation of the injected image. In other embodiments it may be done by stretching the image until it reaches the desired aspect ratio.

In embodiments such as that shown in the projected image may be a stereo image when two projectors are used for the left and right images. To enable stereo viewing the projectors may be disposed at an adjustable distance from one another that enables adjustment based on the interpupillary distance for individual wearers of the eyepiece. For example a single optical assembly may include two independent electro optic modules with individual adjustments for horizontal vertical and tilt positioning. Alternatively the optical assembly may include only a single electro optic module.

In an embodiment of the eyepiece is depicted with a translucent lens on which is being displayed streaming media an e mail application and an incoming call notification . In this embodiment the media obscures a portion of the viewing area however it should be understood that the displayed image may be positioned anywhere in the field of view. In embodiments the media may be made to be more or less transparent.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may receive input from any external source such as an external converter box. The source may be depicted in the lens of eyepiece. In an embodiment when the external source is a phone the eyepiece may use the phone s location capabilities to display location based augmented reality including marker overlay from marker based AR applications. In embodiments a VNC client running on the eyepiece s processor or an associated device may be used to connect to and control a computer where the computer s display is seen in the eyepiece by the wearer. In an embodiment content from any source may be streamed to the eyepiece such as a display from a panoramic camera riding atop a vehicle a user interface for a device imagery from a drone or helicopter and the like. For example a gun mounted camera may enable shooting a target not in direct line of sight when the camera feed is directed to the eyepiece.

The lenses may be chromic such as photochromic or electrochromic. The electrochromic lens may include integral chromic material or a chromic coating which changes the opacity of at least a portion of the lens in response to a burst of charge applied by the processor across the chromic material. For example and referring to a chromic portion of the lens is shown darkened such as for providing greater viewability by the wearer of the eyepiece when that portion is showing displayed content to the wearer. In embodiments there may be a plurality of chromic areas on the lens that may be controlled independently such as large portions of the lens sub portions of the projected area programmable areas of the lens and or projected area controlled to the pixel level and the like. Activation of the chromic material may be controlled via the control techniques further described herein or automatically enabled with certain applications e.g. a streaming video application a sun tracking application an ambient brightness sensor a camera tracking brightness in the field of view or in response to a frame embedded UV sensor. In embodiments an electrochromic layer may be located between optical elements and or on the surface of an optical element on the eyepiece such as on a corrective lens on a ballistic lens and the like. In an example the electrochromic layer may consist of a stack such as an Indium Tin Oxide ITO coated PET PC film with two layers of electrochromic EC between which may eliminate another layer of PET PC thereby reducing reflections e.g. a layer stack may comprise a PET PC EC PET PC EC PET PC . In embodiments the electrically controllable optical layer may be provided as a liquid crystal based solution with a binary state of tint. In other embodiments multiple layers of liquid crystal or an alternative e tint forming the optical layer may be used to provide variable tint such that certain layers or segments of the optical layer may be turned on or off in stages. Electrochromic layers may be used generically for any of the electrically controlled transparencies in the eyepiece including SPD LCD electrowetting and the like.

In embodiments the lens may have an angular sensitive coating which enables transmitting light waves with low incident angles and reflecting light such as s polarized light with high incident angles. The chromic coating may be controlled in portions or in its entirety such as by the control technologies described herein. The lenses may be variable contrast and the contrast may be under the control of a push button or any other control technique described herein. In embodiments the user may wear the interactive head mounted eyepiece where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. The optical assembly may include an electrochromic layer that provides a display characteristic adjustment that is dependent on displayed content requirements and surrounding environmental conditions. In embodiments the display characteristic may be brightness contrast and the like. The surrounding environmental condition may be a level of brightness that without the display characteristic adjustment would make the displayed content difficult to visualize by the wearer of the eyepiece where the display characteristic adjustment may be applied to an area of the optical assembly where content is being displayed.

In embodiments the eyepiece may have brightness contrast spatial resolution and the like control over the eyepiece projected area such as to alter and improve the user s view of the projected content against a bright or dark surrounding environment. For example a user may be using the eyepiece under bright daylight conditions and in order for the user to clearly see the displayed content the display area my need to be altered in brightness and or contrast. Alternatively the viewing area surrounding the display area may be altered. In addition the area altered whether within the display area or not may be spatially oriented or controlled per the application being implemented. For instance only a small portion of the display area may need to be altered such as when that portion of the display area deviates from some determined or predetermined contrast ratio between the display portion of the display area and the surrounding environment. In embodiments portions of the lens may be altered in brightness contrast spatial extent resolution and the like such as fixed to include the entire display area adjusted to only a portion of the lens adaptable and dynamic to changes in lighting conditions of the surrounding environment and or the brightness contrast of the displayed content and the like. Spatial extent e.g. the area affected by the alteration and resolution e.g. display optical resolution may vary over different portions of the lens including high resolution segments low resolution segments single pixel segments and the like where differing segments may be combined to achieve the viewing objectives of the application s being executed. In embodiments technologies for implementing alterations of brightness contrast spatial extent resolution and the like may include electrochromic materials LCD technologies embedded beads in the optics flexible displays suspension particle device SPD technologies colloid technologies and the like.

In embodiments there may be various modes of activation of the electrochromic layer. For example the user may enter sunglass mode where the composite lenses appear only somewhat darkened or the user may enter Blackout mode where the composite lenses appear completely blackened.

In an example of a technology that may be employed in implementing the alterations of brightness contrast spatial extent resolution and the like may be electrochromic materials films inks and the like. Electrochromism is the phenomenon displayed by some materials of reversibly changing appearance when electric charge is applied. Various types of materials and structures can be used to construct electrochromic devices depending on the specific applications. For instance electrochromic materials include tungsten oxide WO which is the main chemical used in the production of electrochromic windows or smart glass. In embodiments electrochromic coatings may be used on the lens of the eyepiece in implementing alterations. In another example electrochromic displays may be used in implementing electronic paper which is designed to mimic the appearance of ordinary paper where the electronic paper displays reflected light like ordinary paper. In embodiments electrochromism may be implemented in a wide variety of applications and materials including gyricon consisting of polyethylene spheres embedded in a transparent silicone sheet with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely electro phoretic displays forming images by rearranging charged pigment particles using an applied electric field E Ink technology electro wetting electro fluidic interferometric modulator organic transistors embedded into flexible substrates nano chromics displays NCD and the like.

In another example of a technology that may be employed in implementing the alterations of brightness contrast spatial extent resolution and the like may be suspended particle devices SPD . When a small voltage is applied to an SPD film its microscopic particles which in their stable state are randomly dispersed become aligned and allow light to pass through. The response may be immediate uniform and with stable color throughout the film. Adjustment of the voltage may allow users to control the amount of light glare and heat passing through. The system s response may range from a dark blue appearance with up to full blockage of light in its off state to clear in its on state. In embodiments SPD technology may be an emulsion applied on a plastic substrate creating the active film. This plastic film may be laminated as a single glass pane suspended between two sheets of glass plastic or other transparent materials and the like.

Referring to in certain embodiments the electro optics may be mounted in a monocular or binocular flip up flip down arrangement in two parts 1 electro optics and 2 correction lens. depicts a two part eyepiece where the electro optics are contained within a module that may be electrically connected to the eyepiece via an electrical connector such as a plug pin socket wiring and the like. In this arrangement the lens in the frame may be a correction lens entirely. The interpupillary distance IPD between the two halves of the electro optic module may be adjusted at the bridge to accommodate various IPDs. Similarly the placement of the display may be adjusted via the bridge . depicts the binocular electro optics module where one half is flipped up and the other half is flipped down. The nose bridge may be fully adjustable and elastomeric. This enables 3 point mounting on nose bridge and ears with a head strap to assure the stability of images in the user s eyes unlike the instability of helmet mounted optics that shift on the scalp. Referring to the lens may be ANSI compliant hard coat scratch resistant polycarbonate ballistic lenses may be chromic may have an angular sensitive coating may include a UV sensitive material and the like. In this arrangement the electro optics module may include a CMOS based VIS NIR SWIR black silicon sensor for night vision capability. The electro optics module may feature quick disconnect capability for user flexibility field replacement and upgrade. The electro optics module may feature an integrated power dock.

As in the flip up flip down lens may include a light block . Removable elastomeric night adapters light dams light blocks may be used to shield the flip up flip down lens such as for night operations. The exploded top view of the eyepiece also depicts a headstrap frame and adjustable nose bridge . depicts an exploded view of the electro optic assembly in a front A and side angle B view. A holder holds the see through optic with corrective lens . An O ring and screw secures the holder to the shaft . A spring provides a spring loaded connection between the holder and shaft . The shaft connects to the attachment bracket which secures to the eyepiece using the thumbscrew . The shaft serves as a pivot and an IPD adjustment tool using the IPD adjustment knob . As seen in the knob rotates along adjustment threads . The shaft also features two set screw grooves .

In embodiments a photochromic layer may be included as part of the optics of the eyepiece. Photochromism is the reversible transformation of a chemical species between two forms by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation where the two forms have different absorption spectra such as a reversible change of color darkness and the like upon exposure to a given frequency of light. In an example a photochromic layer may be included between the waveguide and corrective optics of the eyepiece on the outside of the corrective optic and the like. In embodiments a photochromic layer such as used as a darkening layer may be activated with a UV diode or other photochromic responsive wavelength known in the art. In the case of the photochromic layer being activated with UV light the eyepiece optics may also include a UV coating outside the photochromic layer to prevent UV light from the Sun from accidentally activating it.

Photochromics are presently fast to change from light to dark and slow to change from dark to light. This due to the molecular changes that are involved with the photochromic material changing from clear to dark. Photochromic molecules are vibrating back to clear after the UV light such as UV light from the sun is removed. By increasing the vibration of the molecules such as by exposure to heat the optic will clear quicker. The speed at which the photochromic layer goes from dark to light may be temperature dependent. Rapid changing from dark to light is particularly important for military applications where users of sunglasses often go from a bright outside environment to a dark inside environment and it is important to be able to see quickly in the inside environment.

This disclosure provides a photochromic film device with an attached heater that is used to accelerate the transition from dark to clear in the photochromic material. This method relies on the relationship between the speed of transition of photochromic materials from dark to clear wherein the transition is faster at higher temperatures. To enable the heater to increase the temperature of the photochromic material rapidly the photochromic material is provided as a thin layer with a thin heater. By keeping the thermal mass of the photochromic film device low per unit area the heater only has to provide a small amount of heat to rapidly produce a large temperature change in the photochromic material. Since the photochromic material only needs to be at a higher temperature during the transition from dark to clear the heater only needs to be used for short periods of time so the power requirement is low.

The heater may be a thin and transparent heater element such as an ITO heater or any other transparent and electrically conductive film material. When a user needs the eyepiece to go clear quickly the user may activate the heater element by any of the control techniques discussed herein.

In an embodiment the heater element may be used to calibrate the photochromic element to compensate for cold ambient conditions when the lenses might go dark on their own.

In another embodiment a thin coat of photochromic material may be deposited on a thick substrate with the heater element layered on top. For example the cover sunglass lens may comprise an accelerated photochromic solution and still have a separate electrochromic patch over the display area that may optionally be controlled with or without UV light.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 152 215 describes a heater layer combined with a photochromic layer to heat the photochromic material for the purpose of reducing the time to transition from dark to clear. However the photochromic layer is positioned in a wedge which would greatly increase the thermal mass of the device and thereby decrease the rate that the heater could change the temperature of the photochromic material or alternately greatly increase the power required to change the temperature of the photochromic material.

This disclosure includes the use of a thin carrier layer that the photochromic material is applied to. The carrier layer can be glass or plastic. The photochromic material can be applied by vacuum coating by dipping or by thermal diffusion into the carrier layer as is well known in the art. The thickness of the carrier layer can be 150 microns or less. The selection of the thickness of the carrier layer is selected based on the desired darkness of the photochromic film device in the dark state and the desired speed of transition between the dark state and the clear state. Thicker carrier layers can be darker in the dark state while being slower to heat to an elevated temperature due to having more thermal mass. Conversely thinner carrier layers can be less dark in the dark state while being faster to heat to an elevated temperature due to having less thermal mass.

The protective layer shown in is separated from the photochromic film device to keep the thermal mass of the photochromic film device low. In this way the protective layer can be made thicker to provide higher impact strength. The protective layer can be glass or plastic for example the protective layer can be polycarbonate.

The heater can be a transparent conductor that is patterned into a conductive path that is relatively uniform so that the heat generated over the length of the patterned heater is relatively uniform. An example of a transparent conductor that can be patterned is titanium dioxide. A larger area is provided at the ends of the heater pattern for electrical contacts such as is shown in .

As noted in the discussion for the augmented reality glasses may include a lens for each eye of the wearer. The lenses may be made to fit readily into the frame so that each lens may be tailored for the person for whom the glasses are intended. Thus the lenses may be corrective lenses and may also be tinted for use as sunglasses or have other qualities suitable for the intended environment. Thus the lenses may be tinted yellow dark or other suitable color or may be photochromic so that the transparency of the lens decreases when exposed to brighter light. In one embodiment the lenses may also be designed for snap fitting into or onto the frames i.e. snap on lenses are one embodiment. For example the lenses may be made from high quality Schott optical glass and may include a polarizing filter.

Of course the lenses need not be corrective lenses they may simply serve as sunglasses or as protection for the optical system within the frame. In non flip up flip down arrangements it goes without saying that the outer lenses are important for helping to protect the rather expensive waveguides viewing systems and electronics within the augmented reality glasses. At a minimum the outer lenses offer protection from scratching by the environment of the user whether sand brambles thorns and the like in one environment and flying debris bullets and shrapnel in another environment. In addition the outer lenses may be decorative acting to change a look of the composite lens perhaps to appeal to the individuality or fashion sense of a user. The outer lenses may also help one individual user to distinguish his or her glasses from others for example when many users are gathered together.

It is desirable that the lenses be suitable for impact such as a ballistic impact. Accordingly in one embodiment the lenses and the frames meet ANSI Standard Z87.1 2010 for ballistic resistance. In one embodiment the lenses also meet ballistic standard CE EN166B. In another embodiment for military uses the lenses and frames may meet the standards of MIL PRF 31013 standards 3.5.1.1 or 4.4.1.1. Each of these standards has slightly different requirements for ballistic resistance and each is intended to protect the eyes of the user from impact by high speed projectiles or debris. While no particular material is specified polycarbonate such as certain Lexan grades usually is sufficient to pass tests specified in the appropriate standard.

In one embodiment as shown in the lenses snap in from the outside of the frame not the inside for better impact resistance since any impact is expected from the outside of the augmented reality eyeglasses. In this embodiment replaceable lens has a plurality of snap fit arms which fit into recesses of frame . The engagement angle of the arm is greater than 90 while the engagement angle of the recess is also greater than 90 . Making the angles greater than right angles has the practical effect of allowing removal of lens from the frame . The lens may need to be removed if the person s vision has changed or if a different lens is desired for any reason. The design of the snap fit is such that there is a slight compression or bearing load between the lens and the frame. That is the lens may be held firmly within the frame such as by a slight interference fit of the lens within the frame.

The cantilever snap fit of is not the only possible way to removably snap fit the lenses and the frame. For example an annular snap fit may be used in which a continuous sealing lip of the frame engages an enlarged edge of the lens which then snap fits into the lip or possibly over the lip. Such a snap fit is typically used to join a cap to an ink pen. This configuration may have an advantage of a sturdier joint with fewer chances for admission of very small dust and dirt particles. Possible disadvantages include the fairly tight tolerances required around the entire periphery of both the lens and frame and the requirement for dimensional integrity in all three dimensions over time.

It is also possible to use an even simpler interface which may still be considered a snap fit. A groove may be molded into an outer surface of the frame with the lens having a protruding surface which may be considered a tongue that fits into the groove. If the groove is semi cylindrical such as from about 270 to about 300 the tongue will snap into the groove and be firmly retained with removal still possible through the gap that remains in the groove. In this embodiment shown in a lens or replacement lens or cover with a tongue may be inserted into a groove in a frame even though the lens or cover is not snap fit into the frame. Because the fit is a close one it will act as a snap fit and securely retain the lens in the frame.

In another embodiment the frame may be made in two pieces such as a lower portion and an upper portion with a conventional tongue and groove fit. In another embodiment this design may also use standard fasteners to ensure a tight grip of the lens by the frame. The design should not require disassembly of anything on the inside of the frame. Thus the snap on or other lens or cover should be assembled onto the frame or removed from the frame without having to go inside the frame. As noted in other parts of this disclosure the augmented reality glasses have many component parts. Some of the assemblies and subassemblies may require careful alignment. Moving and jarring these assemblies may be detrimental to their function as will moving and jarring the frame and the outer or snap on lens or cover.

In embodiments the flip up flip down arrangement enables a modular design for the eyepiece. For example not only can the eyepiece be equipped with a monocular or binocular module but the lens may also be swapped. In embodiments additional features may be included with the module either associated with one or both displays . Referring to either monocular or binocular versions of the module may be display only monocular binocular or may be equipped with a forward looking camera monocular and binocular . In some embodiments the module may have additional integrated electronics such as a GPS a laser range finder and the like. In the embodiment enabling urban leader tactical response awareness visualization also known as Ultra V is a binocular electro optic module is equipped with stereo forward looking cameras GPS and a laser range finder . These features may enable the Ultra V is embodiment to have panoramic night vision and panoramic night vision with laser range finder and geo location.

In another embodiment an augmented reality eyepiece may include electrically controlled lenses as part of the microprojector or as part of the optics between the microprojector and the waveguide. depicts an embodiment with such liquid lenses .

The glasses may also include at least one camera or optical sensor that may furnish an image or images for viewing by the user. The images are formed by a microprojector on each side of the glasses for conveyance to the waveguide on that side. In one embodiment an additional optical element a variable focus lens may also be furnished. The lens may be electrically adjustable by the user so that the image seen in the waveguides are focused for the user. In embodiments the camera may be a multi lens camera such as an array camera where the eyepiece processor may combine the data from the multiple lenses and multiple viewpoints of the lenses to build a single high quality image. This technology may be referred to as computational imaging since software is used to process the image. Computational imaging may provide image processing advantages such as allowing processing of the composite image as a function of individual lens images. For example since each lens may provide it s own image the processor may provide image processing to create images with special focusing such as foveal imaging where the focus from one of the lens images is clear higher resolution and the like and where the rest of the image is defocused lower resolution and the like. The processor may also select portions of the composite image to store in memory while deleting the rest such as when memory storage is limited and only portions of the composite image are critical to save. In embodiments use of the array camera may provide the ability to alter the focus of an image after the image has been taken. In addition to the imaging advantages of an array camera the array camera may provide a thinner mechanical profile than a traditional single lens assembly thus making it easier to integrate into the eyepiece.

Variable lenses may include the so called liquid lenses furnished by Varioptic S.A. Lyons France or by LensVector Inc. Mountain View Calif. U.S.A. Such lenses may include a central portion with two immiscible liquids. Typically in these lenses the path of light through the lens i.e. the focal length of the lens is altered or focused by applying an electric potential between electrodes immersed in the liquids. At least one of the liquids is affected by the resulting electric or magnetic field potential. Thus electrowetting may occur as described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2010 0007807 assigned to LensVector Inc. Other techniques are described in LensVector Pat. Appl. Publs. 2009 021331 and 2009 0316097. All three of these disclosures are incorporated herein by reference as though each page and figures were set forth verbatim herein.

Other patent documents from Varioptic S.A. describe other devices and techniques for a variable focus lens which may also work through an electrowetting phenomenon. These documents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 245 440 and 7 894 440 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publs. 2010 0177386 and 2010 0295987 each of which is also incorporated herein by reference as though each page and figures were set forth verbatim herein. In these documents the two liquids typically have different indices of refraction and different electrical conductivities e.g. one liquid is conductive such as an aqueous liquid and the other liquid is insulating such as an oily liquid. Applying an electric potential may change the thickness of the lens and does change the path of light through the lens thus changing the focal length of the lens.

The electrically adjustable lenses may be controlled by the controls of the glasses. In one embodiment a focus adjustment is made by calling up a menu from the controls and adjusting the focus of the lens. The lenses may be controlled separately or may be controlled together. The adjustment is made by physically turning a control knob by indicating with a gesture or by voice command. In another embodiment the augmented reality glasses may also include a rangefinder and focus of the electrically adjustable lenses may be controlled automatically by pointing the rangefinder such as a laser rangefinder to a target or object a desired distance away from the user.

As shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7 894 440 discussed above the variable lenses may also be applied to the outer lenses of the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece. In one embodiment the lenses may simply take the place of a corrective lens. The variable lenses with their electric adjustable control may be used instead of or in addition to the image source or projector mounted lenses. The corrective lens inserts provide corrective optics for the user s environment the outside world whether the waveguide displays are active or not.

It is important to stabilize the images presented to the wearer of the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece s that is the images seen in the waveguide. The view or images presented travel from one or two digital cameras or sensors mounted on the eyepiece to digital circuitry where the images are processed and if desired stored as digital data before they appear in the display of the glasses. In any event and as discussed above the digital data is then used to form an image such as by using an LCOS display and a series of RGB light emitting diodes. The light images are processed using a series of lenses a polarizing beam splitter an electrically powered liquid corrective lens and at least one transition lens from the projector to the waveguide.

The process of gathering and presenting images includes several mechanical and optical linkages between components of the augmented reality glasses. It seems clear therefore that some form of stabilization will be required. This may include optical stabilization of the most immediate cause the camera itself since it is mounted on a mobile platform the glasses which themselves are movably mounted on a mobile user. Accordingly camera stabilization or correction may be required. In addition at least some stabilization or correction should be used for the liquid variable lens. Ideally a stabilization circuit at that point could correct not only for the liquid lens but also for any aberration and vibration from many parts of the circuit upstream from the liquid lens including the image source. One advantage of the present system is that many commercial off the shelf cameras are very advanced and typically have at least one image stabilization feature or option. Thus there may be many embodiments of the present disclosure each with a same or a different method of stabilizing an image or a very fast stream of images as discussed below. The term optical stabilization is typically used herein with the meaning of physically stabilizing the camera camera platform or other physical object while image stabilization refers to data manipulation and processing.

One technique of image stabilization is performed on digital images as they are formed. This technique may use pixels outside the border of the visible frame as a buffer for the undesired motion. Alternatively the technique may use another relatively steady area or basis in succeeding frames. This technique is applicable to video cameras shifting the electronic image from frame to frame of the video in a manner sufficient to counteract the motion. This technique does not depend on sensors and directly stabilizes the images by reducing vibrations and other distracting motion from the moving camera. In some techniques the speed of the images may be slowed in order to add the stabilization process to the remainder of the digital process and requiring more time per image. These techniques may use a global motion vector calculated from frame to frame motion differences to determine the direction of the stabilization.

Optical stabilization for images uses a gravity or electronically driven mechanism to move or adjust an optical element or imaging sensor such that it counteracts the ambient vibrations. Another way to optically stabilize the displayed content is to provide gyroscopic correction or sensing of the platform housing the augmented reality glasses e.g. the user. As noted above the sensors available and used on the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece include MEMS gyroscopic sensors. These sensors capture movement and motion in three dimensions in very small increments and can be used as feedback to correct the images sent from the camera in real time. It is clear that at least a large part of the undesired and undesirable movement probably is caused by movement of the user and the camera itself. These larger movements may include gross movements of the user e.g. walking or running riding in a vehicle. Smaller vibrations may also result within the augmented reality eyeglasses that is vibrations in the components in the electrical and mechanical linkages that form the path from the camera input to the image in the waveguide output . These gross movements may be more important to correct or to account for rather than for instance independent and small movements in the linkages of components downstream from the projector. In embodiments the gyroscopic stabilization may stabilize the image when it is subject to a periodic motion. For such periodic motion the gyroscope may determine the periodicity of the user s motion and transmit the information to a processor to correct for the placement of content in the user s view. The gyroscope may utilize a rolling average of two or three or more cycles of periodic motion in determining the periodicity. Other sensors may also be used to stabilize the image or correctly place the image in the user s field of view such as an accelerometer a position sensor a distance sensor a rangefinder a biological sensor a geodetic sensor an optical sensor a video sensor a camera an infrared sensor a light sensor a photocell sensor or an RF sensor. When a sensor detects user head or eye movement the sensor provides an output to a processor which may determine the direction speed amount and rate of the user s head or eye movement. The processor may convert this information into a suitable data structure for further processing by the processor controlling the optical assembly which may be the same processor . The data structure may be one or more vector quantities. For example the direction of the vector may define the orientation of the movement and the length of the vector may define the rate of the movement. Using the processed sensor output the display of content is adjusted accordingly.

Motion sensing may thus be used to sense the motion and correct for it as in optical stabilization or to sense the motion and then correct the images that are being taken and processed as in image stabilization. An apparatus for sensing motion and correcting the images or the data is depicted in . In this apparatus one or more kinds of motion sensors may be used including accelerometers angular position sensors or gyroscopes such as MEMS gyroscopes. Data from the sensors is fed back to the appropriate sensor interfaces such as analog to digital converters ADCs or other suitable interface such as digital signal processors DSPs . A microprocessor then processes this information as discussed above and sends image stabilized frames to the display driver and then to the see through display or waveguide discussed above. In one embodiment the display begins with the RGB display in the microprojector of the augmented reality eyepiece.

In another embodiment a video sensor or augmented reality glasses or other device with a video sensor may be mounted on a vehicle. In this embodiment the video stream may be communicated through a telecommunication capability or an Internet capability to personnel in the vehicle. One application could be sightseeing or touring of an area. Another embodiment could be exploring or reconnaissance or even patrolling of an area. In these embodiments gyroscopic stabilization of the image sensor would be helpful rather than applying a gyroscopic correction to the images or digital data representing the images. An embodiment of this technique is depicted in . In this technique a camera or image sensor is mounted on a vehicle . One or more motion sensors such as gyroscopes are mounted in the camera assembly . A stabilizing platform receives information from the motion sensors and stabilizes the camera assembly so that jitter and wobble are minimized while the camera operates. This is true optical stabilization. Alternatively the motion sensors or gyroscopes may be mounted on or within the stabilizing platform itself. This technique would actually provide optical stabilization stabilizing the camera or image sensor in contrast to digital stabilization correcting the image afterwards by computer processing of the data taken by the camera.

In one technique the key to optical stabilization is to apply the stabilization or correction before an image sensor converts the image into digital information. In one technique feedback from sensors such as gyroscopes or angular velocity sensors is encoded and sent to an actuator that moves the image sensor much as an autofocus mechanism adjusts a focus of a lens. The image sensor is moved in such a way as to maintain the projection of the image onto the image plane which is a function of the focal length of the lens being used. Autoranging and focal length information perhaps from a range finder of the interactive head mounted eyepiece may be acquired through the lens itself. In another technique angular velocity sensors sometimes also called gyroscopic sensors can be used to detect respectively horizontal and vertical movements. The motion detected may then be fed back to electromagnets to move a floating lens of the camera. This optical stabilization technique however would have to be applied to each lens contemplated making the result rather expensive.

Stabilization of the liquid lens is discussed in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2010 0295987 assigned to Varioptic S.A. Lyon France. In theory control of a liquid lens is relatively simple since there is only one variable to control the level of voltage applied to the electrodes in the conducting and non conducting liquids of the lens using for examples the lens housing and the cap as electrodes. Applying a voltage causes a change or tilt in the liquid liquid interface via the electrowetting effect. This change or tilt adjusts the focus or output of the lens. In its most basic terms a control scheme with feedback would then apply a voltage and determine the effect of the applied voltage on the result i.e. a focus or an astigmatism of the image. The voltages may be applied in patterns for example equal and opposite and voltages both positive voltages of differing magnitude both negative voltages of differing magnitude and so forth. Such lenses are known as electrically variable optic lenses or electro optic lenses.

Voltages may be applied to the electrodes in patterns for a short period of time and a check on the focus or astigmatism made. The check may be made for instance by an image sensor. In addition sensors on the camera or in this case the lens may detect motion of the camera or lens. Motion sensors would include accelerometers gyroscopes angular velocity sensors or piezoelectric sensors mounted on the liquid lens or a portion of the optic train very near the liquid lens. In one embodiment a table such as a calibration table is then constructed of voltages applied and the degree of correction or voltages needed for given levels of movement. More sophistication may also be added for example by using segmented electrodes in different portions of the liquid so that four voltages may be applied rather than two. Of course if four electrodes are used four voltages may be applied in many more patterns than with only two electrodes. These patterns may include equal and opposite positive and negative voltages to opposite segments and so forth. An example is depicted in . Four electrodes are mounted within a liquid lens housing not shown . Two electrodes are mounted in or near the non conducting liquid and two are mounted in or near the conducting liquid. Each electrode is independent in terms of the possible voltage that may be applied.

Look up or calibration tables may be constructed and placed in the memory of the augmented reality glasses. In use the accelerometer or other motion sensor will sense the motion of the glasses i.e. the camera on the glasses or the lens itself. A motion sensor such as an accelerometer will sense in particular small vibration type motions that interfere with smooth delivery of images to the waveguide. In one embodiment the image stabilization techniques described here can be applied to the electrically controllable liquid lens so that the image from the projector is corrected immediately. This will stabilize the output of the projector at least partially correcting for the vibration and movement of the augmented reality eyepiece as well as at least some movement by the user. There may also be a manual control for adjusting the gain or other parameter of the corrections. Note that this technique may also be used to correct for near sightedness or far sightedness of the individual user in addition to the focus adjustment already provided by the image sensor controls and discussed as part of the adjustable focus projector.

Another variable focus element uses tunable liquid crystal cells to focus an image. These are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. Nos. 2009 0213321 2009 0316097 and 2010 0007807 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety and relied on. In this method a liquid crystal material is contained within a transparent cell preferably with a matching index of refraction. The cell includes transparent electrodes such as those made from indium tin oxide ITO . Using one spiral shaped electrode and a second spiral shaped electrode or a planar electrode a spatially non uniform magnetic field is applied. Electrodes of other shapes may be used. The shape of the magnetic field determines the rotation of molecules in the liquid crystal cell to achieve a change in refractive index and thus a focus of the lens. The liquid crystals can thus be electromagnetically manipulated to change their index of refraction making the tunable liquid crystal cell act as a lens.

In a first embodiment a tunable liquid crystal cell is depicted in . The cell includes an inner layer of liquid crystal and thin layers of orienting material such as polyimide. This material helps to orient the liquid crystals in a preferred direction. Transparent electrodes are on each side of the orienting material. An electrode may be planar or may be spiral shaped as shown on the right in . Transparent glass substrates contain the materials within the cell. The electrodes are formed so that they will lend shape to the magnetic field. As noted a spiral shaped electrode on one or both sides such that the two are not symmetrical is used in one embodiment. A second embodiment is depicted in . Tunable liquid crystal cell includes central liquid crystal material transparent glass substrate walls and transparent electrodes. Bottom electrode is planar while top electrode is in the shape of a spiral. Transparent electrodes may be made of indium tin oxide ITO .

Additional electrodes may be used for quick reversion of the liquid crystal to a non shaped or natural state. A small control voltage is thus used to dynamically change the refractive index of the material the light passes through. The voltage generates a spatially non uniform magnetic field of a desired shape allowing the liquid crystal to function as a lens.

In one embodiment the camera includes the black silicon short wave infrared SWIR CMOS sensor described elsewhere in this patent. In another embodiment the camera is a 5 megapixel MP optically stabilized video sensor. In one embodiment the controls include a 3 GHz microprocessor or microcontroller and may also include a 633 MHz digital signal processor with a 30 M polygon second graphic accelerator for real time image processing for images from the camera or video sensor. In one embodiment the augmented reality glasses may include a wireless internet radio or telecommunications capability for wideband personal area network PAN local area network LAN a wide local area network WLAN conforming to IEEE 802.11 or reach back communications. The equipment furnished in one embodiment includes a Bluetooth capability conforming to IEEE 802.15. In one embodiment the augmented reality glasses include an encryption system such as a 256 bit Advanced Encryption System AES encryption system or other suitable encryption program for secure communications.

In one embodiment the wireless telecommunications may include a capability for a 3G or 4G network and may also include a wireless internet capability. In order for an extended life the augmented reality eyepiece or glasses may also include at least one lithium ion battery and as discussed above a recharging capability. The recharging plug may comprise an AC DC power converter and may be capable of using multiple input voltages such as 120 or 240 VAC. The controls for adjusting the focus of the adjustable focus lenses in one embodiment comprises a 2D or 3D wireless air mouse or other non contact control responsive to gestures or movements of the user. A 2D mouse is available from Logitech Fremont Calif. USA. A 3D mouse is described herein or others such as the Cideko AVK05 available from Cideko Taiwan R.O.C may be used.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may comprise electronics suitable for controlling the optics and associated systems including a central processing unit non volatile memory digital signal processors 3 D graphics accelerators and the like. The eyepiece may provide additional electronic elements or features including inertial navigation systems cameras microphones audio output power communication systems sensors stopwatch or chronometer functions thermometer vibratory temple motors motion sensor a microphone to enable audio control of the system a UV sensor to enable contrast and dimming with photochromic materials and the like.

In an embodiment the central processing unit CPU of the eyepiece may be an OMAP with dual 1 GHz processor cores. The CPU may include a 633 MHz DSP giving a capability for the CPU of 30 million polygons second.

The system may also provide dual micro SD secure digital slots for provisioning of additional removable non volatile memory.

An on board camera may provide 1.3 MP color and record up to 60 minutes of video footage. The recorded video may be transferred wirelessly or using a mini USB transfer device to off load footage.

The communications system on a chip SOC may be capable of operating with wide local area networks WLAN Bluetooth version 3.0 a GPS receiver an FM radio and the like.

The eyepiece may operate on a 3.6 VDC lithium ion rechargeable battery for long battery life and ease of use. An additional power source may be provided through solar cells on the exterior of the frame of the system. These solar cells may supply power and may also be capable of recharging the lithium ion battery.

The total power consumption of the eyepiece may be approximately 400 mW but is variable depending on features and applications used. For example processor intensive applications with significant video graphics demand more power and will be closer to 400 mW. Simpler less video intensive applications will use less power. The operation time on a charge also may vary with application and feature usage.

The micro projector illumination engine also known herein as the projector may include multiple light emitting diodes LEDs . In order to provide life like color Osram red Cree green and Cree blue LEDs are used. These are die based LEDs. The RGB engine may provide an adjustable color output allowing a user to optimize viewing for various programs and applications.

In embodiments illumination may be added to the glasses or controlled through various means. For example LED lights or other lights may be embedded in the frame of the eyepiece such as in the nose bridge around the composite lens or at the temples.

The intensity of the illumination and or the color of illumination may be modulated. Modulation may be accomplished through the various control technologies described herein through various applications filtering and magnification.

By way of example illumination may be modulated through various control technologies described herein such as through the adjustment of a control knob a gesture eye movement or voice command. If a user desires to increase the intensity of illumination the user may adjust a control knob on the glasses or he may adjust a control knob in the user interface displayed on the lens or by other means. The user may use eye movements to control the knob displayed on the lens or he may control the knob by other means. The user may adjust illumination through a movement of the hand or other body movement such that the intensity or color of illumination changes based on the movement made by the user. Also the user may adjust the illumination through a voice command such as by speaking a phrase requesting increased or decreased illumination or requesting other colors to be displayed. Additionally illumination modulation may be achieved through any control technology described herein or by other means.

Further the illumination may be modulated per the particular application being executed. As an example an application may automatically adjust the intensity of illumination or color of illumination based on the optimal settings for that application. If the current levels of illumination are not at the optimal levels for the application being executed a message or command may be sent to provide for illumination adjustment.

In embodiments illumination modulation may be accomplished through filtering and or through magnification. For example filtering techniques may be employed that allow the intensity and or color of the light to be changed such that the optimal or desired illumination is achieved. Also in embodiments the intensity of the illumination may be modulated by applying greater or less magnification to reach the desired illumination intensity.

The projector may be connected to the display to output the video and other display elements to the user. The display used may be an SVGA 800 600 dots inch SYNDIANT liquid crystal on silicon LCoS display.

The optics system may be contained within a housing fabricated for 6061 T6 aluminum and glass filled ABS PC.

In an embodiment the eyepiece and associated electronics provide night vision capability. This night vision capability may be enabled by a black silicon SWIR sensor. Black silicon is a complementary metal oxide silicon CMOS processing technique that enhances the photo response of silicon over 100 times. The spectral range is expanded deep into the short wave infra red SWIR wavelength range. In this technique a 300 nm deep absorbing and anti reflective layer is added to the glasses. This layer offers improved responsivity as shown in where the responsivity of black silicon is much greater than silicon s over the visible and NIR ranges and extends well into the SWIR range. This technology is an improvement over current technology which suffers from extremely high cost performance issues as well as high volume manufacturability problems. Incorporating this technology into night vision optics brings the economic advantages of CMOS technology into the design.

Unlike current night vision goggles NVGs which amplify starlight or other ambient light from the visible light spectrum SWIR sensors pick up individual photons and convert light in the SWIR spectrum to electrical signals similar to digital photography. The photons can be produced from the natural recombination of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere at night also referred to as Night Glow. Shortwave infrared devices see objects at night by detecting the invisible shortwave infrared radiation within reflected star light city lights or the moon. They also work in daylight or through fog haze or smoke whereas the current NVG Image Intensifier infrared sensors would be overwhelmed by heat or brightness. Because shortwave infrared devices pick up invisible radiation on the edge of the visible spectrum the SWIR images look like the images produced by visible light with the same shadows and contrast and facial details only in black and white dramatically enhancing recognition so people look like people they don t look like blobs often seen with thermal Imagers. One of the important SWIR capabilities is of providing views of targeting lasers on the battlefield. Targeting lasers 1.064 um are not visible with current night vision goggles. With SWIR Electro optics soldiers will be able to view every targeting laser in use including those used by the enemy. Unlike Thermal Imagers which do not penetrate windows on vehicles or buildings the Visible Near Infrared Short Wave Infrared Sensor can see through them day or night giving users an important tactical advantage.

Certain advantages include using active illumination only when needed. In some instances there may be sufficient natural illumination at night such as during a full moon. When such is the case artificial night vision using active illumination may not be necessary. With black silicon CMOS based SWIR sensors active illumination may not be needed during these conditions and is not provided thus improving battery life.

In addition a black silicon image sensor may have over eight times the signal to noise ratio found in costly indium gallium arsenide image sensors under night sky conditions. Better resolution is also provided by this technology offering much higher resolution than available using current technology for night vision. Typically long wavelength images produced by CMOS based SWIR have been difficult to interpret having good heat detection but poor resolution. This problem is solved with a black image silicon SWIR sensor which relies on much shorter wavelengths. SWIR is highly desirable for battlefield night vision glasses for these reasons. illustrates the effectiveness of black silicon night vision technology providing both before and after images of seeing through a dust b fog and c smoke. The images in demonstrate the performance of the new VIS NIR SWIR black silicon sensor. In embodiments the image sensor may be able to distinguish between changes in the natural environment such as disturbed vegetation disturbed ground and the like. For example an enemy combatant may have recently placed an explosive device in the ground and so the ground over the explosive will be disturbed ground and the image sensor along with processing facilities internal or external to the eyepiece may be able to distinguish the recently disturbed ground from the surrounding ground. In this way a soldier may be able to detect the possible placement of an underground explosive device e.g. an improvised explosive device IED from a distance.

Previous night vision systems suffered from blooms from bright light sources such as streetlights. These blooms were particularly strong in image intensifying technology and are also associated with a loss of resolution. In some cases cooling systems are necessary in image intensifying technology systems increasing weight and shortening battery power lifespan. shows the difference in image quality between A a flexible platform of uncooled CMOS image sensors capable of VIS NIR SWIR imaging and B an image intensified night vision system.

These advantages derive from the CMOS compatible processing technique that enhances the photo response of silicon over 100 times and extends the spectral range deep into the short wave infrared region. The difference in responsivity is illustrated in . While typical night vision goggles are limited to the UV visible and near infrared NIR ranges to about 1100 nm 1.1 micrometers the newer CMOS image sensor ranges also include the short wave infrared SWIR spectrum out to as much as 2000 nm 2 micrometers .

The black silicon core technology may offer significant improvement over current night vision glasses. Femtosecond laser doping may enhance the light detection properties of silicon across a broad spectrum. Additionally optical response may be improved by a factor of 100 to 10 000. The black silicon technology is a fast scalable and CMOS compatible technology at a very low cost compared to current night vision systems. Black silicon technology may also provide a low operation bias with 3.3 V typical. In addition uncooled performance may be possible up to 50 C. Cooling requirements of current technology increase both weight and power consumption and also create discomfort in users. As noted above the black silicon core technology offers a high resolution replacement for current image intensifier technology. Black silicon core technology may provide high speed electronic shuttering at speeds up to 1000 frames second with minimal cross talk. In certain embodiments of the night vision eyepiece an OLED display may be preferred over other optical displays such as the LCoS display.

The eyepiece incorporating the VIS NIR SWIR black silicon sensor may provide for better situational awareness SAAS surveillance and real time image enhancement.

In some embodiments the VIS NIR SWIR black silicon sensor may be incorporated into a form factor suitable for night vision only such as a night vision goggle or a night vision helmet. The night vision goggle may include features that make it suitable for the military market such as ruggedization and alternative power supplies while other form factors may be suitable for the consumer or toy market. In one example the night vision goggles may have extended range such as 500 1200 nm and may also useable as a camera.

In some embodiments the VIS NIR SWIR black silicon sensor as well as other outboard sensors may be incorporated into a mounted camera that may be mounted on transport or combat vehicles so that the real time feed can be sent to the driver or other occupants of the vehicle by superimposing the video on the forward view without obstructing it. The driver can better see where he or she is going the gunner can better see threats or targets of opportunity and the navigator can better sense situational awareness SAAS while also looking for threats. The feed could also be sent to off site locations as desired such as higher headquarters of memory storage locations for later use in targeting navigation surveillance data mining and the like.

Further advantages of the eyepiece may include robust connectivity. This connectivity enables download and transmission using Bluetooth Wi Fi Internet cellular satellite 3G FM AM TV and UVB transceiver for sending receiving vast amounts of data quickly. For example the UWB transceiver may be used to create a very high data rate low probability of intercept low probability of detection LPI LPD Wireless Personal Area Network WPAN to connect weapons sights weapons mounted mouse controller E O sensors medical sensors audio video displays and the like. In other embodiments the WPAN may be created using other communications protocols. For example a WPAN transceiver may be a COTS compliant module front end to make the power management of a combat radio highly responsive and to avoid jeopardizing the robustness of the radio. By integrating the ultra wideband UWB transceiver baseband MAC and encryption chips onto a module a physically small dynamic and configurable transceiver to address multiple operational needs is obtained. The WPAN transceivers create a low power encrypted wireless personal area network WPAN between soldier worn devices. The WPAN transceivers can be attached or embedded into nearly any fielded military device with a network interface handheld computers combat displays etc . The system is capable of supporting many users AES encryption robust against jamming and RF interference as well as being ideal for combat providing low probabilities of interception and detection LPI LPD . The WPAN transceivers eliminate the bulk weight and snagability of data cables on the soldier. Interfaces include USB 1.1 USB 2.0 OTG Ethernet 10 100 Base T and RS232 9 pin D Sub. The power output may be 10 20 dBm outputs for a variable range of up to 2 meters. The data capacity may be 768 Mbps and greater. The bandwidth may be 1.7 GHz. Encryption may be 128 bit 192 bit or 256 bit AES. The WPAN transceiver may include Optimized Message Authentication Code MAC generation. The WPAN transceiver may comply to MIL STD 461F. The WPAN transceiver may be in the form of a connector dust cap and may attach to any fielded military device. The WPAN transceiver allows simultaneous video voice stills text and chat eliminates the need for data cables between electronic devices allows hands free control of multiple devices without distraction features an adjustable connectivity range interfaces with Ethernet and USB 2.0 features an adjustable frequency 3.1 to 10.6 GHz and 200 mw peak draw and nominal standby.

For example the WPAN transceiver may enable creating a WPAN between the eyepiece in the form of a GSE stereo heads up combat display glasses a computer a remote computer controller and biometric enrollment devices like that seen in . In another example the WPAN transceiver may enable creating a WPAN between the eyepiece in the form of flip up down heads up display combat glasses the HUD CPU if it is external a weapon fore grip controller and a forearm computer similar to that seen in .

The eyepiece may provide its own cellular connectivity such as though a personal wireless connection with a cellular system. The personal wireless connection may be available for only the wearer of the eyepiece or it may be available to a plurality of proximate users such as in a Wi Fi hot spot e.g. MiFi where the eyepiece provides a local hotspot for others to utilize. These proximate users may be other wearers of an eyepiece or users of some other wireless computing device such as a mobile communications facility e.g. mobile phone . Through this personal wireless connection the wearer may not need other cellular or Internet wireless connections to connect to wireless services. For instance without a personal wireless connection integrated into the eyepiece the wearer may have to find a WiFi connection point or tether to their mobile communications facility in order to establish a wireless connection. In embodiments the eyepiece may be able to replace the need for having a separate mobile communications device such as a mobile phone mobile computer and the like by integrating these functions and user interfaces into the eyepiece. For instance the eyepiece may have an integrated WiFi connection or hotspot a real or virtual keyboard interface a USB hub speakers e.g. to stream music to or speaker input connections integrated camera external camera and the like. In embodiments an external device in connectivity with the eyepiece may provide a single unit with a personal network connection e.g. WiFi cellular connection keyboard control pad e.g. a touch pad and the like.

Communications from the eyepiece may include communication links for special purposes. For instance an ultra wide bandwidth communications link may be utilized when sending and or receiving large volumes of data in a short amount of time. In another instance a near field communications NFC link may be used with very limited transmission range in order to post information to transmit to personnel when they are very near such as for tactical reasons for local directions for warnings and the like. For example a soldier may be able to post hold information securely and transmit only to people very near by with a need to know or need to use the information. In another instance a wireless personal area network PAN may be utilized such as to connect weapons sights weapons mounted mouse controller electro optic sensors medical sensors audio visual displays and the like.

The eyepiece may include MEMS based inertial navigation systems such as a GPS processor an accelerometer e.g. for enabling head control of the system and other functions a gyroscope an altimeter an inclinometer a speedometer odometer a laser rangefinder and a magnetometer which also enables image stabilization.

The eyepiece may include integrated headphones such as the articulating earbud that provide audio output to the user or wearer.

In an embodiment a forward facing camera see integrated with the eyepiece may enable basic augmented reality. In augmented reality a viewer can image what is being viewed and then layer an augmented edited tagged or analyzed version on top of the basic view. In the alternative associated data may be displayed with or over the basic image. If two cameras are provided and are mounted at the correct interpupillary distance for the user stereo video imagery may be created. This capability may be useful for persons requiring vision assistance. Many people suffer from deficiencies in their vision such as near sightedness far sightedness and so forth. A camera and a very close virtual screen as described herein provides a video for such persons the video adjustable in terms of focal point nearer or farther and fully in control by the person via voice or other command. This capability may also be useful for persons suffering diseases of the eye such as cataracts retinitis pigmentosa and the like. So long as some organic vision capability remains an augmented reality eyepiece can help a person see more clearly. Embodiments of the eyepiece may feature one or more of magnification increased brightness and ability to map content to the areas of the eye that are still healthy. Embodiments of the eyepiece may be used as bifocals or a magnifying glass. The wearer may be able to increase zoom in the field of view or increase zoom within a partial field of view. In an embodiment an associated camera may make an image of the object and then present the user with a zoomed picture. A user interface may allow a wearer to point at the area that he wants zoomed such as with the control techniques described herein so the image processing can stay on task as opposed to just zooming in on everything in the camera s field of view.

A rear facing camera not shown may also be incorporated into the eyepiece in a further embodiment. In this embodiment the rear facing camera may enable eye control of the eyepiece with the user making application or feature selection by directing his or her eyes to a specific item displayed on the eyepiece.

A further embodiment of a device for capturing biometric data about individuals may incorporate a microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera into the device. The microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera may be mounted on a handheld device such as the bio print device the bio phone and could also be mounted on glasses used as part of a bio kit to collect biometric data.

A cassegrain reflector is a combination of a primary concave mirror and a secondary convex mirror. These reflectors are often used in optical telescopes and radio antennas because they deliver good light or sound collecting capability in a shorter smaller package.

In a symmetrical cassegrain both mirrors are aligned about the optical axis and the primary mirror usually has a hole in the center allowing light to reach the eyepiece or a camera chip or light detection device such as a CCD chip. An alternate design often used in radio telescopes places the final focus in front of the primary reflector. A further alternate design may tilt the mirrors to avoid obstructing the primary or secondary mirror and may eliminate the need for a hole in the primary mirror or secondary mirror. The microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera may use any of the above variations with the final selection determined by the desired size of the optic device.

The classic cassegrain configuration uses a parabolic reflector as the primary mirror and a hyperbolic mirror as the secondary mirror. Further embodiments of the microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera may use a hyperbolic primary mirror and or a spherical or elliptical secondary mirror. In operation the classic cassegrain with a parabolic primary mirror and a hyperbolic secondary mirror reflects the light back down through a hole in the primary as shown in . Folding the optical path makes the design more compact and in a micro size suitable for use with the bio print sensor and bio print kit described herein. In a folded optic system the beam is bent to make the optical path much longer than the physical length of the system. One common example of folded optics is prismatic binoculars. In a camera lens the secondary mirror may be mounted on an optically flat optically clear glass plate that closes the lens tube. This support eliminates star shaped diffraction effects that are caused by a straight vaned support spider. This allows for a sealed closed tube and protects the primary mirror albeit at some loss of light collecting power.

The cassegrain design also makes use of the special properties of parabolic and hyperbolic reflectors. A concave parabolic reflector will reflect all incoming light rays parallel to its axis of symmetry to a single focus point. A convex hyperbolic reflector has two foci and reflects all light rays directed at one focus point toward the other focus point. Mirrors in this type of lens are designed and positioned to share one focus placing the second focus of the hyperbolic mirror at the same point as where the image is observed usually just outside the eyepiece. The parabolic mirror reflects parallel light rays entering the lens to its focus which is coincident with the focus of the hyperbolic mirror. The hyperbolic mirror then reflects those light rays to the other focus point where the camera records the image.

Further embodiments may utilize microscopic mirrors to form the camera while still providing for a longer optical path through the use of folded optics. The same principles of cassegrain design are used.

Lens provides optics for use in conjunction with the folded optics of the cassegrain design. The lens may be selected from a variety of types and may vary depending on the application. The threads permit a variety of cameras to be interchanged depending on the needs of the user.

Eye control of feature and option selection may be controlled and activated by object recognition software loaded on the system processor. Object recognition software may enable augmented reality combine the recognition output with querying a database combine the recognition output with a computational tool to determine dependencies likelihoods and the like.

Three dimensional viewing is also possible in an additional embodiment that incorporates a 3D projector. Two stacked picoprojectors not shown may be used to create the three dimensional image output.

Referring to a plurality of digital CMOS Sensors with redundant micros and DSPs for each sensor array and projector detect visible near infrared and short wave infrared light to enable passive day and night operations such as real time image enhancement real time keystone correction and real time virtual perspective correction . The eyepiece may utilize digital CMOS image sensors and directional microphones e.g. microphone arrays as described herein such as for visible imaging for monitoring the visible scene e.g. for biometric recognition gesture control coordinated imaging with 2D 3D projected maps IR UV imaging for scene enhancement e.g. seeing through haze smoke in the dark sound direction sensing e.g. the direction of a gunshot or explosion voice detection and the like. In embodiments each of these sensor inputs may be fed to a digital signal processor DSP for processing such as internal to the eyepiece or as interfaced to external processing facilities. The outputs of the DSP processing of each sensor input stream may then be algorithmically combined in a manner to generate useful intelligence data. For instance this system may be useful for a combination of real time facial recognition real time voice detection and analysis through links to a database especially with distortion corrections and contemporaneous GPS location for soldiers service personnel and the like such as in monitoring remote areas of interest e.g. known paths or trails or high security areas.

The augmented reality eyepiece or glasses may be powered by any stored energy system such as battery power solar power line power and the like. A solar energy collector may be placed on the frame on a belt clip and the like. Battery charging may occur using a wall charger car charger on a belt clip in a glasses case and the like. In one embodiment the eyepiece may be rechargeable and be equipped with a mini USB connector for recharging. In another embodiment the eyepiece may be equipped for remote inductive recharging by one or more remote inductive power conversion technologies such as those provided by Powercast Ligonier Pa. USA and Fulton Int l. Inc. Ada Mich. USA which also owns another provider Splashpower Inc. Cambridge UK.

The augmented reality eyepiece also includes a camera and any interface necessary to connect the camera to the circuit. The output of the camera may be stored in memory and may also be displayed on the display available to the wearer of the glasses. A display driver may also be used to control the display. The augmented reality device also includes a power supply such as a battery as shown power management circuits and a circuit for recharging the power supply. As noted elsewhere recharging may take place via a hard connection e.g. a mini USB connector or by means of an inductor a solar panel input and so forth.

The control system for the eyepiece or glasses may include a control algorithm for conserving power when the power source such as a battery indicates low power. This conservation algorithm may include shutting power down to applications that are energy intensive such as lighting a camera or sensors that require high levels of energy such as any sensor requiring a heater for example. Other conservation steps may include slowing down the power used for a sensor or for a camera e.g. slowing the sampling or frame rates going to a slower sampling or frame rate when the power is low or shutting down the sensor or camera at an even lower level. Thus there may be at least three operating modes depending on the available power a normal mode a conserve power mode and an emergency or shutdown mode.

Applications of the present disclosure may be controlled through movements and direct actions of the wearer such as movement of his or her hand finger feet head eyes and the like enabled through facilities of the eyepiece e.g. accelerometers gyros cameras optical sensors GPS sensors and the like and or through facilities worn or mounted on the wearer e.g. body mounted sensor control facilities . In this way the wearer may directly control the eyepiece through movements and or actions of their body without the use of a traditional hand held remote controller. For instance the wearer may have a sense device such as a position sense device mounted on one or both hands such as on at least one finger on the palm on the back of the hand and the like where the position sense device provides position data of the hand and provides wireless communications of position data as command information to the eyepiece. In embodiments the sense device of the present disclosure may include a gyroscopic device e.g. electronic gyroscope MEMS gyroscope mechanical gyroscope quantum gyroscope ring laser gyroscope fiber optic gyroscope accelerometers MEMS accelerometers velocity sensors force sensors pressure sensors optical sensors proximity sensor RFID and the like in the providing of position information. For example a wearer may have a position sense device mounted on their right index finger where the device is able to sense motion of the finger. In this example the user may activate the eyepiece either through some switching mechanism on the eyepiece or through some predetermined motion sequence of the finger such as moving the finger quickly tapping the finger against a hard surface and the like. Note that tapping against a hard surface may be interpreted through sensing by accelerometers force sensors pressure sensors and the like. The position sense device may then transmit motions of the finger as command information such as moving the finger in the air to move a cursor across the displayed or projected image moving in quick motion to indicate a selection and the like. In embodiments the position sense device may send sensed command information directly to the eyepiece for command processing or the command processing circuitry may be co located with the position sense device such as in this example mounted on the finger as part of an assembly including the sensors of the position sense device.

In embodiments the wearer may have a plurality of position sense devices mounted on their body. For instance and in continuation of the preceding example the wearer may have position sense devices mounted on a plurality of points on the hand such as with individual sensors on different fingers or as a collection of devices such as in a glove. In this way the aggregate sense command information from the collection of sensors at different locations on the hand may be used to provide more complex command information. For instance the wearer may use a sensor device glove to play a game where the glove senses the grasp and motion of the user s hands on a ball bat racket and the like in the use of the present disclosure in the simulation and play of a simulated game. In embodiments the plurality of position sense devices may be mounted on different parts of the body allowing the wearer to transmit complex motions of the body to the eyepiece for use by an application.

In embodiments the sense device may have a force sensor pressure sensor and the like such as for detecting when the sense device comes in contact with an object. For instance a sense device may include a force sensor at the tip of a wearer s finger. In this case the wearer may tap multiple tap sequence taps swipe touch and the like to generate a command to the eyepiece. Force sensors may also be used to indicate degrees of touch grip push and the like where predetermined or learned thresholds determine different command information. In this way commands may be delivered as a series of continuous commands that constantly update the command information being used in an application through the eyepiece. In an example a wearer may be running a simulation such as a game application military application commercial application and the like where the movements and contact with objects such as through at least one of a plurality of sense devices are fed to the eyepiece as commands that influence the simulation displayed through the eyepiece. For instance a sense device may be included in a pen controller where the pen controller may have a force sensor pressure sensor inertial measurement unit and the like and where the pen controller may be used to produce virtual writing control a cursor associated with the eyepiece s display act as a computer mouse provide control commands though physical motion and or contact and the like.

In embodiments the sense device may include an optical sensor or optical transmitter as a way for movement to be interpreted as a command. For instance a sense device may include an optical sensor mounted on the hand of the wearer and the eyepiece housing may include an optical transmitter such that when a user moves their hand past the optical transmitter on the eyepiece the motions may be interpreted as commands. A motion detected through an optical sensor may include swiping past at different speeds with repeated motions combinations of dwelling and movement and the like. In embodiments optical sensors and or transmitters may be located on the eyepiece mounted on the wearer e.g. on the hand foot in a glove piece of clothing or used in combinations between different areas on the wearer and the eyepiece and the like.

In one embodiment a number of sensors useful for monitoring the condition of the wearer or a person in proximity to the wearer are mounted within the augmented reality glasses. Sensors have become much smaller thanks to advances in electronics technology. Signal transducing and signal processing technologies have also made great progress in the direction of size reduction and digitization. Accordingly it is possible to have not merely a temperature sensor in the AR glasses but an entire sensor array. These sensors may include as noted a temperature sensor and also sensor to detect pulse rate beat to beat heart variability EKG or ECG respiration rate core body temperature heat flow from the body galvanic skin response or GSR EMG EEG EOG blood pressure body fat hydration level activity level oxygen consumption glucose or blood sugar level body position and UV radiation exposure or absorption. In addition there may also be a retinal sensor and a blood oxygenation sensor such as an Sp0sensor among others. Such sensors are available from a variety of manufacturers including Vermed Bellows Falls Vt. USA VTI Ventaa Finland and ServoFlow Lexington Mass. USA.

In some embodiments it may be more useful to have sensors mounted on the person or on equipment of the person rather than on the glasses themselves. For example accelerometers motion sensors and vibration sensors may be usefully mounted on the person on clothing of the person or on equipment worn by the person. These sensors may maintain continuous or periodic contact with the controller of the AR glasses through a Bluetooth radio transmitter or other radio device adhering to IEEE 802.11 specifications. For example if a physician wishes to monitor motion or shock experienced by a patient during a foot race the sensors may be more useful if they are mounted directly on the person s skin or even on a T shirt worn by the person rather than mounted on the glasses. In these cases a more accurate reading may be obtained by a sensor placed on the person or on the clothing rather than on the glasses. Such sensors need not be as tiny as the sensors which would be suitable for mounting on the glasses themselves and be more useful as seen.

The AR glasses or goggles may also include environmental sensors or sensor arrays. These sensors are mounted on the glasses and sample the atmosphere or air in the vicinity of the wearer. These sensors or sensor array may be sensitive to certain substances or concentrations of substances. For example sensors and arrays are available to measure concentrations of carbon monoxide oxides of nitrogen NO temperature relative humidity noise level volatile organic chemicals VOC ozone particulates hydrogen sulfide barometric pressure and ultraviolet light and its intensity. Vendors and manufacturers include Sensares Crolles FR Cairpol Ales FR Critical Environmental Technologies of Canada Delta B.C. Canada Apollo Electronics Co. Shenzhen China and AV Technology Ltd. Stockport Cheshire UK. Many other sensors are well known. If such sensors are mounted on the person or on clothing or equipment of the person they may also be useful. These environmental sensors may include radiation sensors chemical sensors poisonous gas sensors and the like.

In one embodiment environmental sensors health monitoring sensors or both are mounted on the frames of the augmented reality glasses. In another embodiment the sensors may be mounted on the person or on clothing or equipment of the person. For example a sensor for measuring electrical activity of a heart of the wearer may be implanted with suitable accessories for transducing and transmitting a signal indicative of the person s heart activity.

The signal may be transmitted a very short distance via a Bluetooth radio transmitter or other radio device adhering to IEEE 802.15.1 specifications. Other frequencies or protocols may be used instead. The signal may then be processed by the signal monitoring and processing equipment of the augmented reality glasses and recorded and displayed on the virtual screen available to the wearer. In another embodiment the signal may also be sent via the AR glasses to a friend or squad leader of the wearer. Thus the health and well being of the person may be monitored by the person and by others and may also be tracked over time.

In another embodiment environmental sensors may be mounted on the person or on equipment of the person. For example radiation or chemical sensors may be more useful if worn on outer clothing or a web belt of the person rather than mounted directly on the glasses. As noted above signals from the sensors may be monitored locally by the person through the AR glasses. The sensor readings may also be transmitted elsewhere either on demand or automatically perhaps at set intervals such as every quarter hour or half hour. Thus a history of sensor readings whether of the person s body readings or of the environment may be made for tracking or trending purposes.

In an embodiment an RF micropower impulse radio MIR sensor may be associated with the eyepiece and serve as a short range medical radar. The sensor may operate on an ultra wide band. The sensor may include an RF impulse generator receiver and signal processor and may be useful for detecting and measuring cardiac signals by measuring ion flow in cardiac cells within 3 mm of the skin. The receiver may be a phased array antenna to enable determining a location of the signal in a region of space. The sensor may be used to detect and identify cardiac signals through blockages such as walls water concrete dirt metal wood and the like. For example a user may be able to use the sensor to determine how many people are located in a concrete structure by how many heart rates are detected. In another embodiment a detected heart rate may serve as a unique identifier for a person so that they may be recognized in the future. In an embodiment the RF impulse generator may be embedded in one device such as the eyepiece or some other device while the receiver is embedded in a different device such as another eyepiece or device. In this way a virtual tripwire may be created when a heart rate is detected between the transmitter and receiver. In an embodiment the sensor may be used as an in field diagnostic or self diagnosis tool. EKG s may be analyzed and stored for future use as a biometric identifier. A user may receive alerts of sensed heart rate signals and how many heart rates are present as displayed content in the eyepiece.

In an embodiment a sense device enables simultaneous electric field sensing through the eyepiece. Electric field EF sensing is a method of proximity sensing that allows computers to detect evaluate and work with objects in their vicinity. Physical contact with the skin such as a handshake with another person or some other physical contact with a conductive or a non conductive device or object may be sensed as a change in an electric field and either enable data transfer to or from the eyepiece or terminate data transfer. For example videos captured by the eyepiece may be stored on the eyepiece until a wearer of the eyepiece with an embedded electric field sensing transceiver touches an object and initiates data transfer from the eyepiece to a receiver. The transceiver may include a transmitter that includes a transmitter circuit that induces electric fields toward the body and a data sense circuit which distinguishes transmitting and receiving modes by detecting both transmission and reception data and outputs control signals corresponding to the two modes to enable two way communication. An instantaneous private network between two people may be generated with a contact such as a handshake. Data may be transferred between an eyepiece of a user and a data receiver or eyepiece of the second user. Additional security measures may be used to enhance the private network such as facial or audio recognition detection of eye contact fingerprint detection biometric entry and the like.

In embodiments there may be an authentication facility associated with accessing functionality of the eyepiece such as access to displayed or projected content access to restricted projected content enabling functionality of the eyepiece itself e.g. as through a login to access functionality of the eyepiece either in whole or in part and the like. Authentication may be provided through recognition of the wearer s voice iris retina fingerprint and the like or other biometric identifier. For example the eyepiece or an associated controller may have an IR ultrasonic or capacitive tactile sensor for receiving control input related to authentication or other eyepiece functions. A capacitance sensor can detect a fingerprint and launch an application or otherwise control an eyepiece function. Each finger has a different fingerprint so each finger can be used to control different eyepiece functions or quick launch different applications or provide various levels of authentication. Capacitance does not work with gloves but an ultrasonic sensor does and can be used in the same way to provide biometric authentication or control. Ultrasonic sensors useful in the eyepiece or associated controller include Sonavation s SonicTouch technology used in Sonavation s SonicSlide sensors which works by acoustically measuring the ridges and valleys of the fingerprint to image the fingerprint in 256 shades of gray in order to discern the slightest fingerprint detail. The key imaging component of the SonicSlide sensor is the ceramic Micro Electro Mechanical System MEMS piezoelectric transducer array that is made from a ceramic composite material.

The authentication system may provide for a database of biometric inputs for a plurality of users such that access control may be provided for use of the eyepiece based on policies and associated access privileges for each of the users entered into the database. The eyepiece may provide for an authentication process. For instance the authentication facility may sense when a user has taken the eyepiece off and require re authentication when the user puts it back on. This better ensures that the eyepiece only provides access to those users that are authorized and for only those privileges that the wearer is authorized for. In an example the authentication facility may be able to detect the presence of a user s eye or head as the eyepiece is put on. In a first level of access the user may only be able to access low sensitivity items until authentication is complete. During authentication the authentication facility may identify the user and look up their access privileges. Once these privileges have been determined the authentication facility may then provide the appropriate access to the user. In the case of an unauthorized user being detected the eyepiece may maintain access to low sensitivity items further restrict access deny access entirely and the like.

In an embodiment a receiver may be associated with an object to enable control of that object via touch by a wearer of the eyepiece wherein touch enables transmission or execution of a command signal in the object. For example a receiver may be associated with a car door lock. When a wearer of the eyepiece touches the car the car door may unlock. In another example a receiver may be embedded in a medicine bottle. When the wearer of the eyepiece touches the medicine bottle an alarm signal may be initiated. In another example a receiver may be associated with a wall along a sidewalk. As the wearer of the eyepiece passes the wall or touches the wall advertising may be launched either in the eyepiece or on a video panel of the wall.

In an embodiment when a wearer of the eyepiece initiates a physical contact a WiFi exchange of information with a receiver may provide an indication that the wearer is connected to an online activity such as a game or may provide verification of identity in an online environment. In the embodiment a representation of the person could change color or undergo some other visual indication in response to the contact.

In another example the tactile interface may be one or more vibratory temple motors which may vibrate to alert or notify the user such as to danger left danger right a medical condition and the like. The tactile interface may be mounted on a controller separate from the eyepiece such as a worn controller hand carried controller and the like. If there is an accelerometer in the controller then it may sense the user tapping such as on a keyboard on their hand either on the hand with the controller or tapping with the hand that has the controller and the like. The wearer may then touch the tactile interface in a plurality of ways to be interpreted by the eyepiece as commands such as by tapping one or multiple times on the interface by brushing a finger across the interface by pressing and holding by pressing more than one interface at a time and the like. In embodiments the tactile interface may be attached to the wearer s body e.g. their hand arm leg torso neck their clothing as an attachment to their clothing as a ring as a bracelet as a necklace and the like. For example the interface may be attached on the body such as on the back of the wrist where touching different parts of the interface provides different command information e.g. touching the front portion the back portion the center holding for a period of time tapping swiping and the like . In embodiments user contact with the tactile interface may be interpreted through force pressure movement and the like. For instance the tactile interface may incorporate resistive touch technologies capacitive touch technologies proportional pressure touch technologies and the like. In an example the tactile interface may utilize discrete resistive touch technologies where the application requires the interface to be simple rugged low power and the like. In another example the tactile interface may utilize capacitive tough technologies where more functionality is required through the interface such as though movement swiping multi point contacts and the like.

Alternately the wearer may take the ring controller AA off and place it down on a surface AA e.g. a table top such that the camera AA has a view of the wearer. An image of the wearer AA may then be displayed on the display area AA of the eyepiece and transmitted to others on the videoconference such as along with the images AA of other participants on the videoconference call. In embodiments the camera AA may provide for manual or automatic FOV AA adjustment. For instance the wearer may set the ring controller AA down on a surface AA for use in a video conference call and the FOV AA may be controlled either manually e.g. through button controls voice control other tactile interface or automatically e.g. though face recognition in order for the camera s FOV AA to be directed to the wearer s face. The FOV AA may be enabled to change as the wearer moves such as by tracking by face recognition. The FOV AA may also zoomed in out to adjust to changes in the position of the wearer s face.

In embodiments a camera may be incorporated in a plurality of different mobile devices such as worn on the arm hand wrist finger and the like such as the watch with embedded camera as shown in . As with the ring controller AA any of these mobile devices may include manual and or automatic functions as described for the ring controller AA. In embodiments the ring controller AA may have additional sensors embedded functions control features and the like such as a fingerprint scanner tactile feedback and LCD screen an accelerometer Bluetooth and the like. For instance the ring controller may provide for synchronized monitoring between the eyepiece and other control components such as described herein.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide a system and method for providing an image of the wearer to videoconference participants through the use of an external mirror where the wearer views themselves in the mirror and an image of themselves is captured through an integrated camera of the eyepiece. The captured image may be used directly or the image may be flipped to correct for the image reversal of the mirror. In an example the wearer may enter into a videoconference with a plurality of other people where the wearer may be able to view live video images of the others though the eyepiece. By utilizing an ordinary mirror and an integrated camera in the eyepiece the user may be able to view themselves in the mirror have the image captured by the integrated camera and provide the other people with a image of themselves for purposes of the videoconference. This image may also be available to the wearer as a projected image to the eyepiece such as in addition to the images of the other people involved in the videoconference.

In embodiments a control component may provide a surface sensing component in the control device for detecting motion across a surface may also be provided. The surface sensing component may be disposed on the palmar side of the user s hand. The surface may be at least one of a hard surface a soft surface surface of the user s skin surface of the user s clothing and the like.

The viewed object s identification may be determined by the processor in association with a camera integrated with the eyepiece. The control device may control a function of the eyepiece. The function may be associated with the displayed content. The function may be a mode control of the eyepiece. The control device may be foldable for ease of storage when not worn by the user. In embodiments the control device may be used with external devices such as to control the external device in association with the eyepiece. External devices may be entertainment equipment audio equipment portable electronic devices navigation devices weapons automotive controls and the like.

In embodiments a body worn control device e.g. as worn on a finger attached to the hand at the palm on the arm leg torso and the like may provide 3D position sensor information to the eyepiece. For instance the control device may act as an air mouse where 3D position sensors e.g. accelerometers gyros and the like provide position information when a user commands so such as with the click of a button a voice command a visually detected gesture and the like. The user may be able to use this feature to navigate either a 2D or 3D image being projected to the user via the eyepiece projection system. Further the eyepiece may provide an external relay of the image for display or projection to others such as in the case of a presentation. The user may be able to change the mode of the control device between 2D and 3D in order to accommodate different functions applications user interfaces and the like. In embodiments multiple 3D control devices may be utilized for certain applications such as in simulation applications.

In embodiments a system may comprise an interactive head mounted eyepiece worn by a user wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content wherein the optical assembly comprises a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly and a tactile control interface mounted on the eyepiece that accepts control inputs from the user through at least one of a user touching the interface and the user being proximate to the interface.

In embodiments control of the eyepiece and especially control of a cursor associated with displayed content to the user may be enabled through hand control such as with a worn device as in as a virtual computer mouse A as in and the like. For instance the worn device may transmit commands through physical interfaces e.g. a button scroll wheel and the virtual computer mouse A may be able interpret commands though detecting motion and actions of the user s thumb fist hand and the like. In computing a physical mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. A physical mouse traditionally consists of an object held under one of the user s hands with one or more buttons. It sometimes features other elements such as wheels which allow the user to perform various system dependent operations or extra buttons or features that can add more control or dimensional input. The mouse s motion translates into the motion of a cursor on a display which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface. In the case of the eyepiece the user may be able to utilize a physical mouse a virtual mouse or combinations of the two. In embodiments a virtual mouse may involve one or more sensors attached to the user s hand such as on the thumb A finger A palm A wrist A and the like where the eyepiece receives signals from the sensors and translates the received signals into motion of a cursor on the eyepiece display to the user. In embodiments the signals may be received through an exterior interface such as the tactile interface through a receiver on the interior of the eyepiece at a secondary communications interface on an associated physical mouse or worn interface and the like. The virtual mouse may also include actuators or other output type elements attached to the user s hand such as for haptic feedback to the user through vibration force pressure electrical impulse temperature and the like. Sensors and actuators may be attached to the user s hand by way of a wrap ring pad glove and the like. As such the eyepiece virtual mouse may allow the user to translate motions of the hand into motion of the cursor on the eyepiece display where motions may include slow movements rapid motions jerky motions position change in position and the like and may allow users to work in three dimensions without the need for a physical surface and including some or all of the six degrees of freedom. Note that because the virtual mouse may be associated with multiple portions of the hand the virtual mouse may be implemented as multiple virtual mouse controllers or as a distributed controller across multiple control members of the hand. In embodiments the eyepiece may provide for the use of a plurality of virtual mice such as for one on each of the user s hands one or more of the user s feet and the like.

In embodiments the eyepiece virtual mouse may need no physical surface to operate and detect motion such as through sensors such as one of a plurality of accelerometer types e.g. tuning fork piezoelectric shear mode strain mode capacitive thermal resistive electromechanical resonant magnetic optical acoustic laser three dimensional and the like and through the output signals of the sensor s determine the translational and angular displacement of the hand or some portion of the hand. For instance accelerometers may produce output signals of magnitudes proportional to the translational acceleration of the hand in the three directions. Pairs of accelerometers may be configured to detect rotational accelerations of the hand or portions of the hand. Translational velocity and displacement of the hand or portions of the hand may be determined by integrating the accelerometer output signals and the rotational velocity and displacement of the hand may be determined by integrating the difference between the output signals of the accelerometer pairs. Alternatively other sensors may be utilized such as ultrasound sensors imagers IR RF magnetometer gyro magnetometer and the like. As accelerometers or other sensors may be mounted on various portions of the hand the eyepiece may be able to detect a plurality of movements of the hand ranging from simple motions normally associated with computer mouse motion to more highly complex motion such as interpretation of complex hand motions in a simulation application. In embodiments the user may require only a small translational or rotational action to have these actions translated to motions associated with user intended actions on the eyepiece projection to the user.

In embodiments the virtual mouse may have physical switches associated with it to control the device such as an on off switch mounted on the hand the eyepiece or other part of the body. The virtual mouse may also have on off control and the like through pre defined motions or actions of the hand. For example the operation of the virtual mouse may be enabled through a rapid back and forth motion of the hand. In another example the virtual mouse may be disabled through a motion of the hand past the eyepiece such as in front of the eyepiece. In embodiments the virtual mouse for the eyepiece may provide for the interpretation of a plurality of motions to operations normally associated with physical mouse control and as such familiar to the user without training such as single clicking with a finger double clicking triple clicking right clicking left clicking click and drag combination clicking roller wheel motion and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may provide for gesture recognition such as in interpreting hand gestures via mathematical algorithms.

In embodiments gesture control recognition may be provided through technologies that utilize capacitive changes resulting from changes in the distance of a user s hand from a conductor element as part of the eyepiece s control system and so would require no devices mounted on the user s hand. In embodiments the conductor may be mounted as part of the eyepiece such as on the arm or other portion of the frame or as some external interface mounted on the user s body or clothing. For example the conductor may be an antenna where the control system behaves in a similar fashion to the touch less musical instrument known as the theremin. The theremin uses the heterodyne principle to generate an audio signal but in the case of the eyepiece the signal may be used to generate a control input signal. The control circuitry may include a number of radio frequency oscillators such as where one oscillator operates at a fixed frequency and another controlled by the user s hand where the distance from the hand varies the input at the control antenna. In this technology the user s hand acts as a grounded plate the user s body being the connection to ground of a variable capacitor in an L C inductance capacitance circuit which is part of the oscillator and determines its frequency. In another example the circuit may use a single oscillator two pairs of heterodyne oscillators and the like. In embodiments there may be a plurality of different conductors used as control inputs. In embodiments this type of control interface may be ideal for control inputs that vary across a range such as a volume control a zoom control and the like. However this type of control interface may also be used for more discrete control signals e.g. on off control where a predetermined threshold determines the state change of the control input.

In embodiments the eyepiece may interface with a physical remote control device such as a wireless track pad mouse hand held remote control body mounted remote control remote control mounted on the eyepiece and the like. The remote control device may be mounted on an external piece of equipment such as for personal use gaming professional use military use and the like. For example the remote control may be mounted on a weapon for a soldier such as mounted on a pistol grip on a muzzle shroud on a fore grip and the like providing remote control to the soldier without the need to remove their hands from the weapon. The remote control may be removably mounted to the eyepiece.

In embodiments a remote control for the eyepiece may be activated and or controlled through a proximity sensor. A proximity sensor may be a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. For example a proximity sensor may emit an electromagnetic or electrostatic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation infrared for instance and look for changes in the field or return signal. The object being sensed is often referred to as the proximity sensor s target. Different proximity sensor targets may demand different sensors. For example a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target an inductive proximity sensor requires a metal target. Other examples of proximity sensor technologies include capacitive displacement sensors eddy current magnetic photocell reflective laser passive thermal infrared passive optical CCD reflection of ionizing radiation and the like. In embodiments the proximity sensor may be integral to any of the control embodiments described herein including physical remote controls virtual mouse interfaces mounted on the eyepiece controls mounted on an external piece of equipment e.g. a game controller a weapon and the like.

In embodiments sensors for measuring a user s body motion may be used to control the eyepiece or as an external input such as using an inertial measurement unit IMU a 3 axis magnetometer a 3 axis gyro a 3 axis accelerometer and the like. For instance an sensor may be mounted on the hand s of the user thereby enabling the use of the signals from the sensor for control the eyepiece as described herein. In another instance sensor signals may be received and interpreted by the eyepiece to assess and or utilize the body motions of the user for purposes other than control. In an example sensors mounted on each leg and each arm of the user may provide signals to the eyepiece that allow the eyepiece to measure the gait of the user. The gait of the user may then in turn be used to monitor the gait of the user over time such as to monitor changes in physical behavior improvement during physical therapy changes due to a head trauma and the like. In the instance of monitoring for a head trauma the eyepiece may initially determine a baseline gait profile for the user and then monitor the user over time such as before and after a physical event e.g. a sports related collision an explosion an vehicle accident and the like . In the case of an athlete or person in physical therapy the eyepiece may be used periodically to measure the gait of the user and maintain the measurements in a database for analysis. A running gait time profile may be produced such as to monitor the user s gait for indications of physical traumas physical improvements and the like.

In embodiments control of the eyepiece and especially control of a cursor associated with displayed content to the user may be enabled through the sensing of the motion of a facial feature the tensing of a facial muscle the clicking of the teeth the motion of the jaw and the like of the user wearing the eyepiece through a facial actuation sensor B. For instance as shown in the eyepiece may have a facial actuation sensor as an extension from the eyepiece earphone assembly B from the arm B of the eyepiece and the like where the facial actuation sensor may sense a force a vibration and the like associated with the motion of a facial feature. The facial actuation sensor may also be mounted separate from the eyepiece assembly such as part of a standalone earpiece where the sensor output of the earpiece and the facial actuation sensor may be either transferred to the eyepiece by either wired or wireless communication e.g. Bluetooth or other communications protocol known to the art . The facial actuation sensor may also be attached to around the ear in the mouth on the face on the neck and the like. The facial actuation sensor may also be comprised of a plurality of sensors such as to optimize the sensed motion of different facial or interior motions or actions. In embodiments the facial actuation sensor may detect motions and interpret them as commands or the raw signals may be sent to the eyepiece for interpretation. Commands may be commands for the control of eyepiece functions controls associated with a cursor or pointer as provided as part of the display of content to the user and the like. For example a user may click their teeth once or twice to indicate a single or double click such as normally associated with the click of a computer mouse. In another example the user may tense a facial muscle to indicate a command such as a selection associated with the projected image. In embodiments the facial actuation sensor may utilize noise reduction processing to minimize the background motions of the face the head and the like such as through adaptive signal processing technologies. A voice activity sensor may also be utilized to reduce interference such as from the user from other individuals nearby from surrounding environmental noise and the like. In an example the facial actuation sensor may also improve communications and eliminate noise by detecting vibrations in the cheek of the user during speech such as with multiple microphones to identify the background noise and eliminate it through noise cancellation volume augmentation and the like.

In embodiments the user of the eyepiece may be able to obtain information on some environmental feature location object and the like viewed through the eyepiece by raising their hand into the field of view of the eyepiece and pointing at the object or position. For instance the pointing finger of the user may indicate an environmental feature where the finger is not only in the view of the eyepiece but also in the view of an embedded camera. The system may now be able to correlate the position of the pointing finger with the location of the environmental feature as seen by the camera. Additionally the eyepiece may have position and orientation sensors such as GPS and a magnetometer to allow the system to know the location and line of sight of the user. From this the system may be able to extrapolate the position information of the environmental feature such as to provide the location information to the user to overlay the position of the environmental information onto a 2D or 3D map to further associate the established position information to correlate that position information to secondary information about that location e.g. address names of individuals at the address name of a business at that location coordinates of the location and the like. Referring to in an example the user is looking though the eyepiece C and pointing with their hand C at a house C in their field of view where an embedded camera C has both the pointed hand C and the house C in its field of view. In this instance the system is able to determine the location of the house C and provide location information C and a 3D map superimposed onto the user s view of the environment. In embodiments the information associated with an environmental feature may be provided by an external facility such as communicated with through a wireless communication connection stored internal to the eyepiece such as downloaded to the eyepiece for the current location and the like. In embodiments information provided to the wearer of the eyepiece may include any of a plurality of information related to the scene as viewed by the wearer such as geographic information point of interest information social networking information e.g. Twitter Facebook and the like information related to a person standing in front of the wearer augmented around the person such as floating around the person profile information e.g. such as stored in the wearer s contact list historical information consumer information product information retail information safety information advertisements commerce information security information game related information humorous annotations news related information and the like.

In embodiments the user may be able to control their view perspective relative to a 3D projected image such as a 3D projected image associated with the external environment a 3D projected image that has been stored and retrieved a 3D displayed movie such as downloaded for viewing and the like. For instance and referring again to the user may be able to change the view perspective of the 3D displayed image C such as by turning their head and where the live external environment and the 3D displayed image stay together even as the user turns their head moves their position and the like. In this way the eyepiece may be able to provide an augmented reality by overlaying information onto the user s viewed external environment such as the overlaid 3D displayed map C the location information C and the like where the displayed map information and the like may change as the user s view changes. In another instance with 3D movies or 3D converted movies the perspective of the viewer may be changed to put the viewer into the movie environment with some control of the viewing perspective where the user may be able to move their head around and have the view change in correspondence to the changed head position where the user may be able to walk into the image when they physically walk forward have the perspective change as the user moves the gazing view of their eyes and the like. In addition additional image information may be provided such as at the sides of the user s view that could be accessed by turning the head.

In embodiments the user of one eyepiece may be able to synchronize their view of a projected image with at least the view of a second user of an eyepiece. For instance two separate eyepiece users may wish to view the same 3D map game projection point of interest projection and the like where the two viewers are not only seeing the same projected content but where the projected content s view is synchronized between them. In an example two users may want to jointly view a 3D map of a region and the image is synchronized such that the one user may be able to point at a position on the 3D map that the other user is able to see and interact with. The two users may be able to move around the 3D map and share a virtual physical interaction between the two users and the 3D map and the like. Further a group of eyepiece wearers may be able to jointly interact with a projection as a group. In this way two or more users may be able to have a unified augmented reality experience through the coordination synchronization of their eyepieces. Synchronization of two or more eyepieces may be provided by communication of position information between the eyepieces such as absolute position information relative position information translation and rotational position information and the like such as from position sensors as described herein e.g. gyroscopes IMU GPS and the like . Communications between the eyepieces may be direct through an Internet network through the cell network through a satellite network and the like. Processing of position information contributing to the synchronization may be executed in a master processor in a single eyepiece collectively amongst a group of eyepieces in remote server system and the like or any combination thereof. In embodiments the coordinated synchronized view of projected content between multiple eyepieces may provide an extended augmented reality experience from the individual to a plurality of individuals where the plurality of individuals benefit from the group augmented reality experience. For example a group of concertgoers may synchronize their eyepieces with a feed from the concert producers such that visual effects or audio may be pushed to people with eyepieces by the concert producer performers other audience members and the like. In an example the performer may have a master eyepiece and may control sending content to audience members. In one embodiment the content may be the performer s view of the surrounding environment. The performer may be using the master eyepiece for applications as well such as controlling an external lighting system interacting with an augmented reality drum kit or sampling board calling up song lyrics and the like.

In embodiments the eyepiece may utilize sound projection techniques to realize a direction of sound for the wearer of the eyepiece such as with surround sound techniques. Realization of a direction of sound for a wearer may include the reproduction of the sound from the direction of origin either in real time or as a playback. It may include a visual or audible indicator to provide a direction for the source of sound. Sound projection techniques may be useful to an individual that has their hearing impaired or blocked such as due to the user experiencing hearing loss a user wearing headphones a user wearing hearing protection and the like. In this instance the eyepiece may provide enhanced 3D audible reproduction. In an example the wearer may have headphones on and a gunshot has been fired. In this example the eyepiece may be able to reproduce the 3D sound profile for the sound of the gunshot thus allowing the wearer to respond to the gunshot knowing where the sound came from. In another example a wearer with headphones hearing loss in a loud environment and the like may not otherwise be able to tell what s being said and or the direction of the person speaking but is provided with a 3D sound enhancement from the eyepiece e.g. the wearer is listening to other proximate individuals through headphones and so does not have directionality information . In another example a wearer may be in a loud ambient environment or in an environment where periodic loud noises can occur. In this instance the eyepiece may have the ability to cut off the loud sound to protect the wearer s hearing or the sound could be so loud that the wearer can t tell where the sound came from and further now their ears could be ringing so loud they can t hear anything. To aid in this situation the eyepiece may provide visible auditory vibration and the like queues to the wearer to indicate the direction of the sound source. In embodiments the eyepiece may provide augmented hearing where the wearer s ears are plugged to protect their ears from loud noises but using the ear buds to generate a reproduction of sound to replace what s missing form the natural world. This artificial sound may then be used to give directionality to wirelessly transmitted communication that the operator couldn t hear naturally.

In embodiments an example of a configuration for establishing directionality of a source sound may be point different microphones in different directions. For instance at least one microphone may be used for the voice of the wearer at least one microphone for the surrounding environment at least one pointing down at the ground and potentially in a plurality of different discrete directions. In this instance the microphone pointing down may be subtracted to isolate other sounds which may be combined with 3D sound surround and augmented hearing techniques as described herein.

In an example of a sound augmented system as part of the eyepiece there are a number of users with eyepieces such as in a noisy environment where all the users have plugged ears as implemented through artificial noise blockage through the eyepiece ear buds. One of wearers may yell out that they need some piece of equipment. Because of all the ambient noise and the hearing protection the eyepiece creates no one can hear the request for equipment. Here the wearer making the verbal request has a filtered microphone close to their mouth and they could wirelessly transmit the request to the others where their eyepiece could relay a sound signal to the other user s eyepieces and to the ear on the correct side and the others would know to look to the right or left to see who has made the request. This system could be further enhanced with geo locations of all the wearers and a virtual surround sound system that uses the two ear buds to give the perception of 3D space such as the SRS True Surround Technology .

In embodiments auditory queues could also be computer generated so the communicating user doesn t need to verbalize their communication but can select it from a list of common commands the computer generates the communication based on preconfigured conditions and the like. In an example the wearers may be in a situation where they don t want a display in front of their eyes but want to have ear buds in their ears. In this case if they wanted to notify someone in a group to get up and follow them they could just click a controller a certain number of times or provide a visual hand gesturer with a camera an IMU and the like. The system may choose the follow me command and transmit it to the other users with the communicating user s location for the 3D system to trick them into hearing from where they are actually sitting out of sight of them. In embodiments directional information may be determined and or provided through position information from the users of eyepieces.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide aspects of signals intelligence SIGINT such as in the use of existing WiFi 3G Bluetooth and the like communications signals to gather signals intelligence for devices and users in proximity to the wearer of the eyepiece. These signals may be from other eyepieces such as to gather information about other known friendly users other eyepieces that have been picked up by an unauthorized individual such as through a signal that is generated when an unauthorized user tries to use the eyepiece other communications devices e.g. radios cell phones pagers walky talkies and the like electronic signals emanating from devices that may not be directly used for communications and the like. Information gathered by the eyepiece may be direction information position information motion information number of and or rate of communications and the like. Further information may be gathered through the coordinated operations of multiple eyepieces such as in the triangulation of a signal for determination of the signal s location.

Referring to in embodiments the user of the eyepiece D may be able to use multiple hand finger points from their hand D to define the field of view FOV D of the camera D relative to the see thru view such as for augmented reality applications. For instance in the example shown the user is utilizing their first finger and thumb to adjust the FOV D of the camera D of the eyepiece D. The user may utilize other combinations to adjust the FOV D such as with combinations of fingers fingers and thumb combinations of fingers and thumbs from both hands use of the palm s cupped hand s and the like. The use of multiple hand finger points may enable the user to alter the FOV of the camera D in much the same way as users of touch screens where different points of the hand finger establish points of the FOV to establish the desired view. In this instance however there is no physical contact made between the user s hand s and the eyepiece. Here the camera may be commanded to associate portions of the user s hand s to the establishing or changing of the FOV of the camera. The command may be any command type described herein including and not limited to hand motions in the FOV of the camera commands associated with physical interfaces on the eyepiece commands associated with sensed motions near the eyepiece commands received from a command interface on some portion of the user and the like. The eyepiece may be able to recognize the finger hand motions as the command such as in some repetitive motion. In embodiments the user may also utilize this technique to adjust some portion of the projected image where the eyepiece relates the viewed image by the camera to some aspect of the projected image such as the hand finger points in view to the projected image of the user. For example the user may be simultaneously viewing the external environment and a projected image and the user utilizes this technique to change the projected viewing area region magnification and the like. In embodiments the user may perform a change of FOV for a plurality of reasons including zooming in or out from a viewed scene in the live environment zoom in or out from a viewed portion of the projected image to change the viewing area allocated to the projected image to change the perspective view of the environment or projected image and the like.

In embodiments the eyepiece may enable simultaneous FOVs. For example simultaneous wide medium and narrow camera FOVs may be used where the user can have different FOVs up simultaneously in view i.e. wide to show the entire field perhaps static and narrow to focus on a particular target perhaps moving with the eye or with a cursor .

In embodiments the eyepiece may be able to determine where the user is gazing or the motion of the user s eye by tracking the eye through reflected light off the user s eye. This information may then be used to help correlate the user s line of sight with respect to the projected image a camera view the external environment and the like and used in control techniques as described herein. For instance the user may gaze at a location on the projected image and make a selection such as with an external remote control or with some detected eye movement e.g. blinking . In an example of this technique and referring to transmitted light E such as infrared light may be reflected E from the eye E and sensed at the optical display e.g. with a camera or other optical sensor . The information may then be analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. In embodiments an eye tracking facility may use the corneal reflection and the center of the pupil as features to track over time use reflections from the front of the cornea and the back of the lens as features to track image features from inside the eye such as the retinal blood vessels and follow these features as the eye rotates and the like. Alternatively the eyepiece may use other techniques to track the motions of the eye such as with components surrounding the eye mounted in contact lenses on the eye and the like. For instance a special contact lens may be provided to the user with an embedded optical component such as a mirror magnetic field sensor and the like for measuring the motion of the eye. In another instance electric potentials may be measured and monitored with electrodes placed around the eyes utilizing the steady electric potential field from the eye as a dipole such as with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. In this instance the electric signal may be derived using contact electrodes placed on the skin around the eye on the frame of the eyepiece and the like. If the eye moves from the centre position towards the periphery the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured signal. By analyzing these changes eye movement may be tracked.

In another example of how eye gaze direction of the user and associated control may be applied involves placement by the eyepiece and optional selection by the user of a visual indicator in the user s peripheral vision such as in order to reduce clutter in the narrow portion of the user s visual field around the gaze direction where the eye s highest visual input resides. Since the brain is limited as to how much information it can process at a time and the brain pays the most attention to visual content close to the direction of gaze the eyepiece may provide projected visual indicators in the periphery of vision as cues to the user. This way the brain may only have to process the detection of the indicator and not the information associated with the indicator thus decrease the potential for overloading the user with information. The indicator may be an icon a picture a color symbol a blinking object and the like and indicate an alert an email arriving an incoming phone call a calendar event an internal or external processing facility that requires attention from the user and the like. With the visual indicator in the periphery the user may become aware of it without being distracted by it. The user may then optionally decide to elevate the content associated with the visual cue in order to see more information such as gazing over to the visual indicator and by doing so opening up it s content. For example an icon representing an incoming email may indicate an email being received. The user may notice the icon and choose to ignore it such as the icon disappearing after a period of time if not activated such as by a gaze or some other control facility . Alternately the user may notice the visual indicator and choose to active it by gazing in the direction of the visual indicator. In the case of the email when the eyepiece detects that the user s eye gaze is coincident with the location of the icon the eyepiece may open up the email and reveal it s content. In this way the user maintains control over what information is being paid attention to and as a result minimize distractions and maximize content usage efficiency.

In embodiments the eyepiece may utilize sub conscious control aspects such as images in the wearer s periphery images presented to the user at rates below conscious perception sub conscious perceptions to a viewed scene by the viewer and the like. For instance a wearer may be presented images through the eyepiece that are at a rate the wearer is unaware of but is subconsciously made aware of as presented content such as a reminder an alert e.g. an alert that calls on the wearer to increase a level of attention to something but not so much so that the user needs a full conscious reminder an indication related to the wearer s immediate environment e.g. the eyepiece has detected something in the wearer s field of view that may have some interest to the wearer and to which the indication draws the wearer s attention and the like. In another instance the eyepiece may provide indicators to the wearer through a brain activity monitoring interface where electrical signals within the brain fire before a person realizes they ve recognized an image. For instance the brain activity monitoring interface may include electroencephalogram EEG sensors or the like to monitor brain activity as the wearer is viewing the current environment. When the eyepiece through the brain activity monitoring interface senses that the wearer has become aware of an element of the surrounding environment the eyepiece may provide conscious level feedback to the wearer to make the wearer more aware of the element. For example a wearer may unconsciously become aware of seeing a familiar face in a crowd e.g. a friend a suspect a celebrity and the eyepiece provides a visual or audio indication to the wearer to bring the person more consciously to the attention of the wearer. In another example the wearer may view a product that arouses their attention at a subconscious level and the eyepiece provides a conscious indication to the wearer more information about the product an enhanced view of the product a link to more information about the product and the like. In embodiments the ability for the eyepiece to extend the wearer s reality to a subconscious level may enable the eyepiece to provide the wearer with an augmented reality beyond their normal conscious experience with the world around them.

In embodiments the eyepiece may have a plurality of modes of operation where control of the eyepiece is controlled at least in part by positions shapes motions of the hand and the like. To provide this control the eyepiece may utilize hand recognition algorithms to detect the shape of the hand fingers and to then associate those hand configurations possibly in combination with motions of the hand as commands. Realistically as there may be only a limited number of hand configurations and motions available to command the eyepiece these hand configurations may need to be reused depending upon the mode of operation of the eyepiece. In embodiments certain hand configurations or motions may be assigned for transitioning the eyepiece from one mode to the next thereby allowing for the reuse of hand motions. For instance and referring to the user s hand F may be moved in view of a camera on the eyepiece and the movement may then be interpreted as a different command depending upon the mode such as a circular motion F a motion across the field of view F a back and forth motion F and the like. In a simplistic example suppose there are two modes of operation mode one for panning a view from the projected image and mode two for zooming the projected image. In this example the user may want to use a left to right finger pointed hand motion to command a panning motion to the right. However the user may also want to use a left to right finger pointed hand motion to command a zooming of the image to greater magnification. To allow the dual use of this hand motion for both command types the eyepiece may be configured to interpret the hand motion differently depending upon the mode the eyepiece is currently in and where specific hand motions have been assigned for mode transitions. For instance a clockwise rotational motion may indicate a transition from pan to zoom mode and a counter clockwise rotational motion may indicate a transition from zoom to pan mode. This example is meant to be illustrative and not limiting in anyway where one skilled in the art will recognize how this general technique could be used to implement a variety of command mode structures using the hand s and finger s such as hand finger configurations motions two hand configuration motions and the like.

In embodiments a system may comprise an interactive head mounted eyepiece worn by a user wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content wherein the optical assembly comprises a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly and an integrated camera facility that images a gesture wherein the integrated processor identifies and interprets the gesture as a command instruction. The control instruction may provide manipulation of the content for display a command communicated to an external device and the like.

In embodiments control of the eyepiece may be enabled through eye movement an action of the eye and the like. For instance there may be a camera on the eyepiece that views back to the wearer s eye s where eye movements or actions may be interpreted as command information such as through blinking repetitive blinking blink count blink rate eye open closed gaze tracking eye movements to the side up and down side to side through a sequence of positions to a specific position dwell time in a position gazing toward a fixed object e.g. the corner of the lens of the eyepiece through a certain portion of the lens at a real world object and the like. In addition eye control may enable the viewer to focus on a certain point on the displayed image from the eyepiece and because the camera may be able to correlate the viewing direction of the eye to a point on the display the eyepiece may be able to interpret commands through a combination of where the wearer is looking and an action by the wearer e.g. blinking touching an interface device movement of a position sense device and the like . For example the viewer may be able to look at an object on the display and select that object through the motion of a finger enabled through a position sense device.

In some embodiments the glasses may be equipped with eye tracking devices for tracking movement of the user s eye or preferably both eyes alternatively the glasses may be equipped with sensors for six degree freedom of movement tracking i.e. head movement tracking. These devices or sensors are available for example from Chronos Vision GmbH Berlin Germany and ISCAN Woburn Mass. Retinal scanners are also available for tracking eye movement. Retinal scanners may also be mounted in the augmented reality glasses and are available from a variety of companies such as Tobii Stockholm Sweden and SMI Teltow Germany and ISCAN.

The augmented reality eyepiece also includes a user input interface as shown to allow a user to control the device. Inputs used to control the device may include any of the sensors discussed above and may also include a trackpad one or more function keys and any other suitable local or remote device. For example an eye tracking device may be used to control another device such as a video game or external tracking device. As an example depicts a user with an augmented reality eyepiece equipped with an eye tracking device A discussed elsewhere in this document. The eye tracking device allows the eyepiece to track the direction of the user s eye or preferably eyes and send the movements to the controller of the eyepiece. Control system includes the augmented reality eyepiece and a control device for the weapon. The movements may then be transmitted to the control device for a weapon controlled by the control device which may be within sight of the user. The movement of the user s eyes is then converted by suitable software to signals for controlling movement in the weapon such as quadrant range and azimuth direction . Additional controls may be used in conjunction with eye tracking such as with the user s trackpad or function keys. The weapon may be large caliber such as a howitzer or mortar or may small caliber such as a machine gun.

The movement of the user s eyes is then converted by suitable software to signals for controlling movement of the weapon such as quadrant range and azimuth direction of the weapon. Additional controls may be used for single or continuous discharges of the weapon such as with the user s trackpad or function keys. Alternatively the weapon may be stationary and non directional such as an implanted mine or shape charge and may be protected by safety devices such as by requiring specific encoded commands. The user of the augmented reality device may activate the weapon by transmitting the appropriate codes and commands without using eye tracking features.

In embodiments control of the eyepiece may be enabled though gestures by the wearer. For instance the eyepiece may have a camera that views outward e.g. forward to the side down and interprets gestures or movements of the hand of the wearer as control signals. Hand signals may include passing the hand past the camera hand positions or sign language in front of the camera pointing to a real world object such as to activate augmentation of the object and the like. Hand motions may also be used to manipulate objects displayed on the inside of the translucent lens such as moving an object rotating an object deleting an object opening closing a screen or window in the image and the like. Although hand motions have been used in the preceding examples any portion of the body or object held or worn by the wearer may also be utilized for gesture recognition by the eyepiece.

In embodiments head motion control may be used to send commands to the eyepiece where motion sensors such as accelerometers gyros or any other sensor described herein may be mounted on the wearer s head on the eyepiece in a hat in a helmet and the like. Referring to head motions may include quick motions of the head such as jerking the head in a forward and or backward motion in an up and or down motion in a side to side motion as a nod dwelling in a position such as to the side moving and holding in position and the like. Motion sensors may be integrated into the eyepiece mounted on the user s head or in a head covering e.g. hat helmet by wired or wireless connection to the eyepiece and the like. In embodiments the user may wear the interactive head mounted eyepiece where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. At least one of a plurality of head motion sensing control devices may be integrated or in association with the eyepiece that provide control commands to the processor as command instructions based upon sensing a predefined head motion characteristic. The head motion characteristic may be a nod of the user s head such that the nod is an overt motion dissimilar from ordinary head motions. The overt motion may be a jerking motion of the head. The control instructions may provide manipulation of the content for display be communicated to control an external device and the like. Head motion control may be used in combination with other control mechanisms such as using another control mechanism as discussed herein to activate a command and for the head motion to execute it. For example a wearer may want to move an object to the right and through eye control as discussed herein select the object and activate head motion control. Then by tipping their head to the right the object may be commanded to move to the right and the command terminated through eye control.

In embodiments the eyepiece may be controlled through audio such as through a microphone. Audio signals may include speech recognition voice recognition sound recognition sound detection and the like. Audio may be detected though a microphone on the eyepiece a throat microphone a jaw bone microphone a boom microphone a headphone ear bud with microphone and the like.

In embodiments command inputs may provide for a plurality of control functions such as turning on off the eyepiece projector turn on off audio turn on off a camera turn on off augmented reality projection turn on off GPS interaction with display e.g. select accept function displayed replay of captured image or video and the like interaction with the real world e.g. capture image or video turn a page of a displayed book and the like perform actions with an embedded or external mobile device e.g. mobile phone navigation device music device VoIP and the like browser controls for the Internet e.g. submit next result and the like email controls e.g. read email display text text to speech compose select and the like GPS and navigation controls e.g. save position recall saved position show directions view location on map and the like.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide 3D display imaging to the user such as through conveying a stereoscopic auto stereoscopic computer generated holography volumetric display image stereograms stereoscopes view sequential displays electro holographic displays parallax two view displays and parallax panoramagrams re imaging systems and the like creating the perception of 3D depth to the viewer. Display of 3D images to the user may employ different images presented to the user s left and right eyes such as where the left and right optical paths have some optical component that differentiates the image where the projector facility is projecting different images to the user s left and right eye s and the like. The optical path including from the projector facility through the optical path to the user s eye may include a graphical display device that forms a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions. A processor such as the integrated processor in the eyepiece or one in an external facility may provide 3D image processing as at least a step in the generation of the 3D image to the user.

In embodiments holographic projection technologies may be employed in the presentation of a 3D imaging effect to the user such as computer generated holography CGH a method of digitally generating holographic interference patterns. For instance a holographic image may be projected by a holographic 3D display such as a display that operates on the basis of interference of coherent light. Computer generated holograms have the advantage that the objects which one wants to show do not have to possess any physical reality at all that is they may be completely generated as a synthetic hologram . There are a plurality of different methods for calculating the interference pattern for a CGH including from the fields of holographic information and computational reduction as well as in computational and quantization techniques. For instance the Fourier transform method and point source holograms are two examples of computational techniques. The Fourier transformation method may be used to simulate the propagation of each plane of depth of the object to the hologram plane where the reconstruction of the image may occur in the far field. In an example process there may be two steps where first the light field in the far observer plane is calculated and then the field is Fourier transformed back to the lens plane where the wavefront to be reconstructed by the hologram is the superposition of the Fourier transforms of each object plane in depth. In another example a target image may be multiplied by a phase pattern to which an inverse Fourier transform is applied. Intermediate holograms may then be generated by shifting this image product and combined to create a final set. The final set of holograms may then be approximated to form kinoforms for sequential display to the user where the kinoform is a phase hologram in which the phase modulation of the object wavefront is recorded as a surface relief profile. In the point source hologram method the object is broken down in self luminous points where an elementary hologram is calculated for every point source and the final hologram is synthesized by superimposing all the elementary holograms.

In an embodiment 3 D or holographic imagery may be enabled by a dual projector system where two projectors are stacked on top of each other for a 3D image output. Holographic projection mode may be entered by a control mechanism described herein or by capture of an image or signal such as an outstretched hand with palm up an SKU an RFID reading and the like. For example a wearer of the eyepiece may view a letter X on a piece of cardboard which causes the eyepiece to enter holographic mode and turning on the second stacked projector. Selecting what hologram to display may be done with a control technique. The projector may project the hologram onto the cardboard over the letter X . Associated software may track the position of the letter X and move the projected image along with the movement of the letter X . In another example the eyepiece may scan a SKU such as a SKU on a toy construction kit and a 3 D image of the completed toy construction may be accessed from an online source or non volatile memory. Interaction with the hologram such as rotating it zooming in out and the like may be done using the control mechanisms described herein. Scanning may be enabled by associated bar code SKU scanning software. In another example a keyboard may be projected in space or on a surface. The holographic keyboard may be used in or to control any of the associated applications functions.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may provide for locking the position of a virtual keyboard down relative to a real environmental object e.g. a table a wall a vehicle dashboard and the like where the virtual keyboard then does not move as the wearer moves their head. In an example and referring to the user may be sitting at a table and wearing the eyepiece and wish to input text into an application such as a word processing application a web browser a communications application and the like. The user may be able to bring up a virtual keyboard or other interactive control element e.g. virtual mouse calculator touch screen and the like to use for input. The user may provide a command for bringing up the virtual keyboard and use a hand gesture for indicating the fixed location of the virtual keyboard . The virtual keyboard may then remain fixed in space relative to the outside environment such as fixed to a location on the table where the eyepiece facilities keep the location of the virtual keyboard on the table even when the user turns their head. That is the eyepiece may compensate for the user s head motion in order to keep the user s view of the virtual keyboard located on the table . In embodiments the user may wear the interactive head mounted eyepiece where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. An integrated camera facility may be provided that images the surrounding environment and identifies a user hand gesture as an interactive control element location command such as a hand finger configuration moved in a certain way positioned in a certain way and the like. The location of the interactive control element then may remain fixed in position with respect to an object in the surrounding environment in response to the interactive control element location command regardless of a change in the viewing direction of the user. In this way the user may be able to utilize a virtual keyboard in much the same way they would a physical keyboard where the virtual keyboard remains in the same location. However in the case of the virtual keyboard there are not physical limitations such as gravity to limit where the user may locate the keyboard. For instance the user could be standing next to a wall and place the keyboard location on the wall and the like. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the virtual keyboard technology may be applied to any controller such as a virtual mouse virtual touch pad virtual game interface virtual phone virtual calculator virtual paintbrush virtual drawing pad and the like. For example a virtual touchpad may be visualized through the eyepiece to the user and positioned by the user such as by use of hand gestures and used in place of a physical touchpad.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may use visual techniques to render the projection of an object e.g. virtual keyboard keypad calculator notepad joystick control panel book onto a surface such as by applying distortions like parallax keystone and the like. For example the appearance of a keyboard projected onto a tabletop in front of the user with proper perspective may be aided through applying a keystone effect where the projection as provided through the eyepiece to the user is distorted so that it looks like it is lying down on the surface of the table. In addition these techniques may be applied dynamically to provide the proper perspective even as the user moves around in relationship to the surface.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may provide for gesture recognition that may be used to provide a keyboard and mouse experience with the eyepiece. For instance with images of a keyboard mouse and fingers overlaid on the lower part of the display the system may be capable of tracking finger positions in real time to enable a virtual desktop. Through gesture recognition tracking may be done without wires and external powered devices. In another instance fingertip locations may be tracked through gesture recognition through the eyepiece without wires and external power such as with gloves with passive RFID chips in each fingertip. In this instance each RFID chip may have its own response characteristic enabling a plurality of digits of the fingers to be read simultaneously. The RFID chips may be paired with the eyewear so that they are distinguishable from other RFID chips that may be operating nearby. The eyewear may provide the signals to activate the RFID chips and have two or more receiving antennas. Each receiving antenna may be connected to a phase measurement circuit element that in turn provides input to a location determining algorithm. The location determining algorithm may also provide velocity and acceleration information and the algorithm that ultimately may provide keyboard and mouse information to the eyepiece operating system. In embodiments with two receiving antennas the azimuthal positions of each fingertip can be determined with the phase difference between the receiving antennas. The relative phase difference between RFID chips may then be used to determine the radial positions of the fingertips.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may use visual techniques to render the projection of a previously taken medical scan onto the wearer s body such as an x ray an ultrasound an MRI a PET scan and the like. For example and referring to the eyepiece may have access to an x ray image taken of the wearer s hand. The eyepiece may then utilize its integrated camera to view the wear s hand A and overlay a projected image A of the x ray onto the hand. Further the eyepiece may be able to maintain the image overlay as the wearer moves their hand and gaze relative to one other. In embodiments this technique may also be implemented while the wearer is looking in the mirror where the eyepiece transposes an image on top of the reflected image. This technique may be used as part of a diagnostic procedure for rehabilitation during physical therapy to encourage exercise and diet to explain to a patient a diagnosis or condition and the like. The images may be the images of the wearer generic images from a database of images for medical conditions and the like. The generic overlay may show some type of internal issue that is typical of a physical condition a projection of what the body will look like if a certain routine is followed for a period of time and the like. In embodiments an external control device such as pointer controller may enable the manipulation of the image. Further the overlay of the image may be synchronized between multiple people each wearing an eyepiece as described herein. For instance a patient and a doctor may both project the image onto the patient s hand where the doctor may now explain a physical ailment while the patient views the synchronized images of the projected scan and the doctor s explanation.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may provide for removing the portions of a virtual keyboard projection where intervening obstructions appear e.g. the user s hand getting in the way where it is not desired to project the keyboard onto the user s hand . In an example and referring to the eyepiece may provide a projected virtual keyboard to the wearer such as onto a tabletop. The wearer may then reach over the virtual keyboard to type. As the keyboard is merely a projected virtual keyboard rather than a physical keyboard without some sort of compensation to the projected image the projected virtual computer would be projected onto the back of the user s hand. However as in this example the eyepiece may provide compensation to the projected image such that the portion of the wearer s hand that is obstructing the intended projection of the virtual keyboard onto the table may be removed from the projection. That is it may not be desirable for portions of the keyboard projection to be visualized onto the user s hand and so the eyepiece subtracts the portion of the virtual keyboard projection that is co located with the wearer s hand . In embodiments the user may wear the interactive head mounted eyepiece where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. The displayed content may include an interactive control element e.g. virtual keyboard virtual mouse calculator touch screen and the like . An integrated camera facility may image a user s body part as it interacts with the interactive control element wherein the processor removes a portion of the interactive control element by subtracting the portion of the interactive control element that is determined to be co located with the imaged user body part based on the user s view. In embodiments this technique of partial projected image removal may be applied to other projected images and obstructions and is not meant to be restricted to this example of a hand over a virtual keyboard.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may provide for intervening obstructions for any virtual content that is displayed over real world content. If some reference frame is determined that places the content at some distance then any object that passes between the virtual image and the viewer may be subtracted from the displayed content so as not to create a discontinuity for the user that is expecting the displayed information to exist at a certain distance away. In embodiments variable focus techniques may also be used to increase the perception of a distance hierarchy amongst the viewed content.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may provide for the ability to determine an intended text input from a sequence of character contacts swiped across a virtual keypad such as with the finger a stylus the entire hand and the like. For example and referring to the eyepiece may be projecting a virtual keyboard where the user wishes to input the word wind . Normally the user would discretely press the key positions for w then i then n and finally d and a facility camera accelerometer and the like such as described herein associated with the eyepiece would interpret each position as being the letter for that position. However the system may also be able to monitor the movement or swipe of the user s finger or other pointing device across the virtual keyboard and determine best fit matches for the pointer movement. In the figure the pointer has started at the character w and swept a path though the characters e r t y u i k n b v f and d where it stops. The eyepiece may observe this sequence and determine the sequence such as through an input path analyzer feed the sensed sequence into a word matching search facility and output a best fit word in this case wind as text . In embodiments the eyepiece may monitor the motion of the pointing device across the keypad and determine the word more directly such as though auto complete word matching pattern recognition object recognition and the like where some separator indicates the space between words such as a pause in the motion of the pointing device a tap of the pointing device a swirling motion of the pointing device and the like. For instance the entire swipe path may be used with pattern or object recognition algorithms to associate whole words with the discrete patterns formed by the user s finger as they move through each character to form words with a pause between the movements as demarcations between the words. The eyepiece may provide the best fit word a listing of best fit words and the like. In embodiments the user may wear the interactive head mounted eyepiece where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. The displayed content may comprise an interactive keyboard control element e.g. a virtual keyboard calculator touch screen and the like and where the keyboard control element is associated with an input path analyzer a word matching search facility and a keyboard input interface. The user may input text by sliding a pointing device e.g. a finger a stylus and the like across character keys of the keyboard input interface in a sliding motion through an approximate sequence of a word the user would like to input as text wherein the input path analyzer determines the characters contacted in the input path the word matching facility finds a best word match to the sequence of characters contacted and inputs the best word match as input text. In embodiments the reference displayed content may be something other than a keyboard such as a sketch pad for freehand text or other interface references like a 4 way joystick pad for controlling a game or real robots and aircraft and the like. Another example may be a virtual drum kit such as with colored pads the user taps to make a sound. The eyepiece s ability to interpret patterns of motion across a surface may allow for projecting reference content in order to give the user something to point at and provide them with visual and or audio feedback. In embodiments the motion detected by the eyepiece may be the motion of the user s eye as they look at the surface. For example the eyepiece may have facilities for tracking the eye movement of the user and by having both the content display locations of a projected virtual keyboard and the gazing direction of the user s eye the eyepiece may be able to detect the line of sight motion of the user s eye across the keyboard and then interpret the motions as words as described herein.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide the capability to command the eyepiece via hand gesture air lettering such as the wearer using their finger to air swipe out a letter word and the like in view of an embedded eyepiece camera where the eyepiece interprets the finger motion as letters words symbols for commanding signatures writing emailing texting and the like. For instance the wearer may use this technique to sign a document utilizing an air signature . The wearer may use this technique to compose text such as in an email text document and the like. The wearer eyepiece may recognize a symbol made through the hand motion as a control command. In embodiments the air lettering may be implemented through hand gesture recognition as interpreted by images captured through an eyepiece camera or through other input control devices such as via an inertial measurement unit IMU mounted in a device on the user s finger hand and the like as described herein.

In embodiments eyepiece facilities may provide for presenting displayed content corresponding to an identified marker indicative of the intention to display the content. That is the eyepiece may be commanded to display certain content based upon sensing a predetermined external visual cue. The visual cue may be an image an icon a picture face recognition a hand configuration a body configuration and the like. The displayed content may be an interface device that is brought up for use a navigation aid to help the user find a location once they get to some travel location an advertisement when the eyepiece views a target image an informational profile and the like. In embodiments visual marker cues and their associated content for display may be stored in memory on the eyepiece in an external computer storage facility and imported as needed such as by geographic location proximity to a trigger target command by the user and the like generated by a third party and the like. In embodiments the user may wear the interactive head mounted eyepiece where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user s view of the surrounding environment an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. An integrated camera facility may be provided that images an external visual cue wherein the integrated processor identifies and interprets the external visual cue as a command to display content associated with the visual cue. Referring to in embodiments the visual cue may be included in a sign in the surrounding environment where the projected content is associated with an advertisement. The sign may be a billboard and the advertisement for a personalized advertisement based on a preferences profile of the user. The visual cue may be a hand gesture and the projected content a projected virtual keyboard . For instance the hand gesture may be a thumb and index finger gesture from a first user hand and the virtual keyboard projected on the palm of the first user hand and where the user is able to type on the virtual keyboard with a second user hand. The hand gesture may be a thumb and index finger gesture combination of both user hands and the virtual keyboard projected between the user hands as configured in the hand gesture where the user is able to type on the virtual keyboard using the thumbs of the user s hands. Visual cues may provide the wearer of the eyepiece with an automated resource for associating a predetermined external visual cue with a desired outcome in the way of projected content thus freeing the wearer from searching for the cues themselves.

In embodiments the eyepiece may include a visual recognition language translation facility for providing translations for visually presented content such as for road signs menus billboards store signs books magazines and the like. The visual recognition language translation facility may utilize optical character recognition to identify letters from the content match the strings of letters to words and phrases through a database of translations. This capability may be completely contained within the eyepiece such as in an offline mode or at least in part in an external computing facility such as on an external server. For instance a user may be in a foreign country where the signs menus and the like are not understood by the wearer of the eyepiece but for which the eyepiece is able to provide translations. These translations may appear as an annotation to the user replace the foreign language words such as on the sign with the translation provided through an audio translation to the user and the like. In this way the wearer won t have to take the effort to look up word translations but rather they would be provided automatically. In an example a user of the eyepiece may be Italian and coming to the United States they have the need to interpret the large number of road signs in order to drive around safely. Referring to the Italian user of the eyepiece is viewing a U.S. stop sign A. In this instance the eyepiece may identify the letters on the sign translate the word stop in the Italian for stop arresto and make the stop sign A appear to read the word arresto rather than stop . In embodiments the eyepiece may also provide simple translation messages to the wearer provide audio translations provide a translation dictionary to the wearer and the like.

In one example the eyepiece may be used in an adaptive environment such as for blind users. In embodiments the results of face recognition or object identification may be processed to obtain an audible result and can be presented as audio to a wearer of the glasses through associated earbuds headphones. In other embodiments the results of face recognition or object identification may be translated into haptic vibrations in the glasses or an associated controller. In an example if someone stands in front of a user of the adaptive glasses a camera may image the person and transmit the image to the integrated processor for processing by face recognition software or to face recognition software operating on a server or in the cloud. The results of the face recognition may be presented as written text in the display of the glasses for certain individuals but for blind or poor vision users the result may be processed to obtain audio. In other examples object recognition may determine the user is approaching a curb doorway or other object and the glasses or controller would audibly or haptically warn the user. For poor vision users the text on the display could be magnified or the contrast could be increased.

In embodiments a GPS sensor may be used to determine a location of the user wearing the adaptive display. The GPS sensor may be accessed by a navigation application to audibly announce various points of interest to the user as they are approached or reached. In embodiments the user may be audibly guided to an endpoint by the navigation application.

The eyepiece may be useful for various applications and markets. It should be understood that the control mechanisms described herein may be used to control the functions of the applications described herein. The eyepiece may run a single application at a time or multiple applications may run at a time. Switching between applications may be done with the control mechanisms described herein. The eyepiece may be used in military applications gaming image recognition applications to view order e books GPS Navigation Position Direction Speed and ETA Mobile TV athletics view pacing ranking and competition times receive coaching telemedicine industrial inspection aviation shopping inventory management tracking firefighting enabled by VIS NIRSWIR sensor that sees through fog haze dark outdoor adventure custom advertising and the like. In an embodiment the eyepiece may be used with e mail such as GMAIL in the Internet web browsing viewing sports scores video chat and the like. In an embodiment the eyepiece may be used for educational training purposes such as by displaying step by step guides such as hands free wireless maintenance and repair instructions. For example a video manual and or instructions may be displayed in the field of view. In an embodiment the eyepiece may be used in Fashion Health and Beauty. For example potential outfits hairstyles or makeup may be projected onto a mirror image of a user. In an embodiment the eyepiece may be used in Business Intelligence Meetings and Conferences. For example a user s name tag can be scanned their face run through a facial recognition system or their spoken name searched in database to obtain biographical information. Scanned name tags faces and conversations may be recorded for subsequent viewing or filing.

In an embodiment a Mode may be entered by the eyepiece. In the mode certain applications may be available. For example a consumer version of the eyepiece may have a Tourist Mode Educational Mode Internet Mode TV Mode Gaming Mode Exercise Mode Stylist Mode Personal Assistant Mode and the like.

A user of the augmented reality glasses may wish to participate in video calling or video conferencing while wearing the glasses. Many computers both desktop and laptop have integrated cameras to facilitate using video calling and conferencing. Typically software applications are used to integrate use of the camera with calling or conferencing features. With the augmented reality glasses providing much of the functionality of laptops and other computing devices many users may wish to utilize video calling and video conferencing while on the move wearing the augmented reality glasses.

In an embodiment a video calling or video conferencing application may work with a WiFi connection or may be part of a 3G or 4G calling network associated with a user s cell phone. The camera for video calling or conferencing is placed on a device controller such as a watch or other separate electronic computing device. Placing the video calling or conferencing camera on the augmented reality glasses is not feasible as such placement would provide the user with a view only of themselves and would not display the other participants in the conference or call. However the user may choose to use the forward facing camera to display their surroundings or another individual in the video call.

In operation the video call camera depends on the signal capture which transforms the incident light as well as incident sound into electrons. For light this process is performed by CCD or CMOS chip . The microphone transforms sound into electrical impulses.

The first step in the process of generating an image for a video call is to digitize the image. The CCD or CMOS chip dissects the image and converts it into pixels. If a pixel has collected many photons the voltage will be high. If the pixel has collected few photons the voltage will be low. This voltage is an analog value. During the second step of digitization the voltage is transformed into a digital value by the analog to digital converter which handles image processing. At this point a raw digital image is available.

Audio captured by the microphone is also transformed into a voltage. This voltage is sent to the analog to digital converter where the analog values are transformed into digital values.

The next step is to enhance the signal so that it may be sent to viewers of the video call or conference. Signal enhancement includes creating color in the image using a color filter located in front of the CCD or CMOS chip . This filter is red green or blue and changes its color from pixel to pixel and in an embodiment may be a color filter array or Bayer filter. These raw digital images are then enhanced by the filter to meet aesthetic requirements. Audio data may also be enhanced for a better calling experience.

In the final step before transmission the image and audio data are compressed and output as a digital video stream in an embodiment using a digital video camera. If a photo camera is used single images may be output and in a further embodiment voice comments may be appended to the files. The enhancement of the raw digital data takes place away from the camera and in an embodiment may occur in the device controller or computing device that the augmented reality glasses communicate with during a video call or conference.

Further embodiments may provide for portable cameras for use in industry medicine astronomy microscopy and other fields requiring specialized camera use. These cameras often forgo signal enhancement and output the raw digital image. These cameras may be mounted on other electronic devices or the user s hand for ease of use.

The camera interfaces to the augmented reality glasses and the device controller or computing device using an IEEE 1394 interface bus. This interface bus transmits time critical data such as a video and data whose integrity is critically important including parameters or files to manipulate data or transfer images.

In addition to the interface bus protocols define the behavior of the devices associated with the video call or conference. The camera for use with the augmented reality glasses may in embodiments employ one of the following protocols AV C DCAM or SBP 2.

AV C is a protocol for Audio Video Control and defines the behavior of digital video devices including video cameras and video recorders.

DCAM refers to the 1394 based Digital Camera Specification and defines the behavior of cameras that output uncompressed image data without audio.

SBP 2 refers to Serial Bus Protocol and defines the behavior of mass storage devices such as hard drives or disks.

Devices that use the same protocol are able to communicate with each other. Thus for video calling using the augmented reality glasses the same protocol may be used by the video camera on the device controller and the augmented reality glasses. Because the augmented reality glasses device controller and camera use the same protocol data may be exchanged among these devices. Files that may be transferred among devices include image and audio files image and audio data flows parameters to control the camera and the like.

In an embodiment a user desiring to initiate a video call may select a video call option from a screen presented when the call process is initiated. The user selects by making a gesture using a pointing device or gesture to signal the selection of the video call option. The user then positions the camera located on the device controller wristwatch or other separable electronic device so that the user s image is captured by the camera. The image is processed through the process described above and is then streamed to the augmented reality glasses and the other participants for display to the users.

In embodiments the camera may be mounted on a cell phone personal digital assistant wristwatch pendant or other small portable device capable of being carried worn or mounted. The images or video captured by the camera may be streamed to the eyepiece. For example when a camera is mounted on a rifle a wearer may be able to image targets not in the line of sight and wirelessly receive imagery as a stream of displayed content to the eyepiece.

In embodiments the present disclosure may provide the wearer with GPS based content reception as in . As noted augmented reality glasses of the present disclosure may include memory a global positioning system a compass or other orienting device and a camera. GPS based computer programs available to the wearer may include a number of applications typically available from the Apple Inc. App Store for iPhone use. Similar versions of these programs are available for other brands of smart phone and may be applied to embodiments of the present disclosure. These programs include for example SREngine scene recognition engine NearestTube TAT Augmented ID Yelp Layar and TwittARound as well as other more specialized applications such as RealSki.

SREngine is a scene recognition engine that is able to identify objects viewed by the user s camera. It is a software engine able to recognize static scenes such as scenes of architecture structures pictures objects rooms and the like. It is then able to automatically apply a virtual label to the structures or objects according to what it recognizes. For example the program may be called up by a user of the present disclosure when viewing a street scene such as . Using a camera of the augmented reality glasses the engine will recognize the Fontaines de la Concorde in Paris. The program will then summon a virtual label shown in as part of a virtual image projected onto the lens . The label may be text only as seen at the bottom of the image . Other labels applicable to this scene may include fountain museum hotel or the name of the columned building in the rear. Other programs of this type may include the Wikitude AR Travel Guide Yelp and many others.

NearestTube for example uses the same technology to direct a user to the closest subway station in London and other programs may perform the same function or similar in other cities. Layar is another application that uses the camera a compass or direction and GPS data to identify a user s location and field of view. With this information an overlay or label may appear virtually to help orient and guide the user. Yelp and Monocle perform similar functions but their databases are somewhat more specialized helping to direct users in a similar manner to restaurants or to other service providers.

The user may control the glasses and call up these functions using any of the controls described in this patent. For example the glasses may be equipped with a microphone to pick up voice commands from a user and process them using software contained with a memory of the glasses. The user may then respond to prompts from small speakers or earbuds also contained within the glasses frame. The glasses may also be equipped with a tiny track pad similar to those found on smartphones. The trackpad may allow a user to move a pointer or indicator on the virtual screen within the AR glasses similar to a touch screen. When the user reaches a desired point on the screen the user depresses the track pad to indicate his or her selection. Thus a user may call up a program e.g. a travel guide and then find his or her way through several menus perhaps selecting a country a city and then a category. The category selections may include for example hotels shopping museums restaurants and so forth. The user makes his or her selections and is then guided by the AR program. In one embodiment the glasses also include a GPS locator and the present country and city provides default locations that may be overridden.

In an embodiment the eyepiece s object recognition software may process the images being received by the eyepiece s forward facing camera in order to determine what is in the field of view. In other embodiments the GPS coordinates of the location as determined by the eyepiece s GPS may be enough to determine what is in the field of view. In other embodiments an RFID or other beacon in the environment may be broadcasting a location. Any one or combination of the above may be used by the eyepiece to identify the location and the identity of what is in the field of view.

When an object is recognized the resolution for imaging that object may be increased or images or video may be captured at low compression. Additionally the resolution for other objects in the user s view may be decreased or captured at a higher compression rate in order to decrease the needed bandwidth.

Once determined content related to points of interest in the field of view may be overlaid on the real world image such as social networking content interactive tours local information and the like. Information and content related to movies local information weather restaurants restaurant availability local events local taxis music and the like may be accessed by the eyepiece and projected on to the lens of the eyepiece for the user to view and interact with. For example as the user looks at the Eiffel Tower the forward facing camera may take an image and send it for processing to the eyepiece s associated processor. Object recognition software may determine that the structure in the wearer s field of view is the Eiffel Tower. Alternatively the GPS coordinates determined by the eyepiece s GPS may be searched in a database to determine that the coordinates match those of the Eiffel Tower. In any event content may then be searched relating to the Eiffel Tower visitor s information restaurants in the vicinity and in the Tower itself local weather local Metro information local hotel information other nearby tourist spots and the like. Interacting with the content may be enabled by the control mechanisms described herein. In an embodiment GPS based content reception may be enabled when a Tourist Mode of the eyepiece is entered.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may be used to view streaming video. For example videos may be identified via search by GPS location search by object recognition of an object in the field of view a voice search a holographic keyboard search and the like. Continuing with the example of the Eiffel Tower a video database may be searched via the GPS coordinates of the Tower or by the term Eiffel Tower once it has been determined that is the structure in the field of view. Search results may include geo tagged videos or videos associated with the Eiffel Tower. The videos may be scrolled or flipped through using the control techniques described herein. Videos of interest may be played using the control techniques described herein. The video may be laid over the real world scene or may be displayed on the lens out of the field of view. In an embodiment the eyepiece may be darkened via the mechanisms described herein to enable higher contrast viewing. In another example the eyepiece may be able to utilize a camera and network connectivity such as described herein to provide the wearer with streaming video conferencing capabilities.

As noted the user of augmented reality may receive content from an abundance of sources. A visitor or tourist may desire to limit the choices to local businesses or institutions on the other hand businesses seeking out visitors or tourists may wish to limit their offers or solicitations to persons who are in their area or location but who are visiting rather than local residents. Thus in one embodiment the visitor or tourist may limit his or her search only to local businesses say those within certain geographic limits. These limits may be set via GPS criteria or by manually indicating a geographic restriction. For example a person may require that sources of streaming content or ads be limited to those within a certain radius a set number or km or miles of the person. Alternatively the criteria may require that the sources are limited to those within a certain city or province. These limits may be set by the augmented reality user just as a user of a computer at a home or office would limit his or her searches using a keyboard or a mouse the entries for augmented reality users are simply made by voice by hand motion or other ways described elsewhere in the portions of this disclosure discussing controls.

In addition the available content chosen by a user may be restricted or limited by the type of provider. For example a user may restrict choices to those with a website operated by a government institution .gov or by a non profit institution or organization .org . In this way a tourist or visitor who may be more interested in visiting government offices museums historical sites and the like may find his or her choices less cluttered. The person may be more easily able to make decisions when the available choices have been pared down to a more reasonable number. The ability to quickly cut down the available choices is desirable in more urban areas such as Paris or Washington D.C. where there are many choices.

The user controls the glasses in any of the manners or modes described elsewhere in this patent. For example the user may call up a desired program or application by voice or by indicating a choice on the virtual screen of the augmented reality glasses. The augmented glasses may respond to a track pad mounted on the frame of the glasses as described above. Alternatively the glasses may be responsive to one or more motion or position sensors mounted on the frame. The signals from the sensors are then sent to a microprocessor or microcontroller within the glasses the glasses also providing any needed signal transducing or processing. Once the program of choice has begun the user makes selections and enters a response by any of the methods discussed herein such as signaling yes or no with a head movement a hand gesture a trackpad depression or a voice command.

At the same time content providers that is advertisers may also wish to restrict their offerings to persons who are within a certain geographic area e.g. their city limits. At the same time an advertiser perhaps a museum may not wish to offer content to local persons but may wish to reach visitors or out of towners. In another example advertisements may not be presented when the user is home but may be presented when the user is traveling or away from home. The augmented reality devices discussed herein are desirably equipped with both GPS capability and telecommunications capability and an integrated processor for implementing geographic based rules for advertisement presentation. It will be a simple matter for the museum to provide streaming content within a limited area by limiting its broadcast power. The museum however may provide the content through the Internet and its content may be available world wide. In this instance a user may receive content through an augmented reality device advising that the museum is open today and is available for touring.

The user may respond to the content by the augmented reality equivalent of clicking on a link for the museum. The augmented reality equivalent may be a voice indication a hand or eye movement or other sensory indication of the user s choice or by using an associated body mounted controller. The museum then receives a cookie indicating the identity of the user or at least the user s internet service provider ISP . If the cookie indicates or suggests an internet service provider other than local providers the museum server may then respond with advertisements or offers tailored to visitors. The cookie may also include an indication of a telecommunications link e.g. a telephone number. If the telephone number is not a local number this is an additional clue that the person responding is a visitor. The museum or other institution may then follow up with the content desired or suggested by its marketing department.

Another application of the augmented reality eyepiece takes advantage of a user s ability to control the eyepiece and its tools with a minimum use of the user s hands using instead voice commands gestures or motions. As noted above a user may call upon the augmented reality eyepiece to retrieve information. This information may already be stored in a memory of the eyepiece but may instead be located remotely such as a database accessible over the Internet or perhaps via an intranet which is accessible only to employees of a particular company or organization. The eyepiece may thus be compared to a computer or to a display screen which can be viewed and heard at an extremely close range and generally controlled with a minimal use of one s hands.

Applications may thus include providing information on the spot to a mechanic or electronics technician. The technician can don the glasses when seeking information about a particular structure or problem encountered for example when repairing an engine or a power supply. Using voice commands he or she may then access the database and search within the database for particular information such as manuals or other repair and maintenance documents. The desired information may thus be promptly accessed and applied with a minimum of effort allowing the technician to more quickly perform the needed repair or maintenance and to return the equipment to service. For mission critical equipment such time savings may also save lives in addition to saving repair or maintenance costs.

The information imparted may include repair manuals and the like but may also include a full range of audio visual information i.e. the eyepiece screen may display to the technician or mechanic a video of how to perform a particular task at the same time the person is attempting to perform the task. The augmented reality device also includes telecommunications capabilities so the technician also has the ability to call on others to assist if there is some complication or unexpected difficulty with the task. This educational aspect of the present disclosure is not limited to maintenance and repair but may be applied to any educational endeavor such as secondary or post secondary classes continuing education courses or topics seminars and the like.

In an embodiment a Wi Fi enabled eyepiece may run a location based application for geo location of opted in users. Users may opt in by logging into the application on their phone and enabling broadcast of their location or by enabling geo location on their own eyepiece. As a wearer of the eyepiece scans people and thus their opted in device the application may identify opted in users and send an instruction to the projector to project an augmented reality indicator on an opted in user in the user s field of view. For example green rings may be placed around people who have opted in to have their location seen. In another example yellow rings may indicate people who have opted in but don t meet some criteria such as they do not have a FACEBOOK account or that there are no mutual friends if they do have a FACEBOOK account.

Some social networking career networking and dating applications may work in concert with the location based application. Software resident on the eyepiece may coordinate data from the networking and dating sites and the location based application. For example TwittARound is one such program which makes use of a mounted camera to detect and label location stamped tweets from other tweeters nearby. This will enable a person using the present disclosure to locate other nearby Twitter users. Alternatively users may have to set their devices to coordinate information from various networking and dating sites. For example the wearer of the eyepiece may want to see all E HARMONY users who are broadcasting their location. If an opted in user is identified by the eyepiece an augmented reality indicator may be laid over the opted in user. The indicator may take on a different appearance if the user has something in common with the wearer many things in common with the user and the like. For example and referring to two people are being viewed by the wearer. Both of the people are identified as E HARMONY users by the rings placed around them. However the woman shown with solid rings has more than one item in common with the wearer while the woman shown with dotted rings has no items in common with the wearer. Any available profile information may get accessed and displayed to the user.

In an embodiment when the wearer directs the eyepiece in the direction of a user who has a networking account such as FACEBOOK TWITTER BLIPPY LINKEDIN GOOGLE WIKIPEDIA and the like the user s recent posts or profile information may be displayed to the wearer. For example recent status updates tweets blips and the like may get displayed as mentioned above for TwittARound. In an embodiment when the wearer points the eyepiece in a target user s direction they may indicate interest in the user if the eyepiece is pointed for a duration of time and or a gesture head eye or audio control is activated. The target user may receive an indication of interest on their phone or in their glasses. If the target user had marked the wearer as interesting but was waiting on the wearer to show interest first an indication may immediately pop up in the eyepiece of the target user s interest. A control mechanism may be used to capture an image and store the target user s information on associated non volatile memory or in an online account.

In other applications for social networking a facial recognition program such as TAT Augmented ID from TAT The Astonishing Tribe Malm Sweden may be used. Such a program may be used to identify a person by his or her facial characteristics. This software uses facial recognition software to identify a person. Using other applications such as photo identifying software from Flickr one can then identify the particular nearby person and one can then download information from social networking sites with information about the person. This information may include the person s name and the profile the person has made available on sites such as Facebook Twitter and the like. This application may be used to refresh a user s memory of a person or to identify a nearby person as well as to gather information about the person.

In other applications for social networking the wearer may be able to utilize location based facilities of the eyepiece to leave notes comments reviews and the like at locations in association with people places products and the like. For example a person may be able to post a comment on a place they visited where the posting may then be made available to others through the social network. In another example a person may be able to post that comment at the location of the place such that the comment is available when another person comes to that location. In this way a wearer may be able to access comments left by others when they come to the location. For instance a wearer may come to the entrance to a restaurant and be able to access reviews for the restaurant such as sorted by some criteria e.g. most recent review age of reviewer and the like .

A user may initiate the desired program by voice by selecting a choice from a virtual touchscreen as described above by using a trackpad to select and choose the desired program or by any of the control techniques described herein. Menu selections may then be made in a similar or complementary manner. Sensors or input devices mounted in convenient locations on the user s body may also be used e.g. sensors and a track pad mounted on a wrist pad on a glove or even a discreet device perhaps of the size of a smart phone or a personal digital assistant.

Applications of the present disclosure may provide the wearer with Internet access such as for browsing searching shopping entertainment and the like such as through a wireless communications interface to the eyepiece. For instance a wearer may initiate a web search with a control gesture such as through a control facility worn on some portion of the wearer s body e.g. on the hand the head the foot on some component being used by the wearer e.g. a personal computer a smart phone a music player on a piece of furniture near the wearer e.g. a chair a desk a table a lamp and the like where the image of the web search is projected for viewing by the wearer through the eyepiece. The wearer may then view the search through the eyepiece and control web interaction though the control facility.

In an example a user may be wearing an embodiment configured as a pair of glasses with the projected image of an Internet web browser provided through the glasses while retaining the ability to simultaneously view at least portions of the surrounding real environment. In this instance the user may be wearing a motion sensitive control facility on their hand where the control facility may transmit relative motion of the user s hand to the eyepiece as control motions for web control such as similar to that of a mouse in a conventional personal computer configuration. It is understood that the user would be enabled to perform web actions in a similar fashion to that of a conventional personal computer configuration. In this case the image of the web search is provided through the eyepiece while control for selection of actions to carry out the search is provided though motions of the hand. For instance the overall motion of the hand may move a cursor within the projected image of the web search the flick of the finger s may provide a selection action and so forth. In this way the wearer may be enabled to perform the desired web search or any other Internet browser enabled function through an embodiment connected to the Internet. In one example a user may have downloaded computer programs Yelp or Monocle available from the App Store or a similar product such as NRU near you an application from Zagat to locate nearby restaurants or other stores Google Earth Wikipedia or the like. The person may initiate a search for example for restaurants or other providers of goods or services such as hotels repairmen and the like or information. When the desired information is found locations are displayed or a distance and direction to a desired location is displayed. The display may take the form of a virtual label co located with the real world object in the user s view.

Other applications from Layar Amsterdam the Netherlands include a variety of layers tailored for specific information desired by a user. A layer may include restaurant information information about a specific company real estate listings gas stations and so forth. Using the information provided in a software application such as a mobile application and a user s global positioning system GPS information may be presented on a screen of the glasses with tags having the desired information. Using the haptic controls or other control discussed elsewhere in this disclosure a user may pivot or otherwise rotate his or her body and view buildings tagged with virtual tags containing information. If the user seeks restaurants the screen will display restaurant information such as name and location. If a user seeks a particular address virtual tags will appear on buildings in the field of view of the wearer. The user may then make selections or choices by voice by trackpad by virtual touch screen and so forth.

Applications of the present disclosure may provide a way for advertisements to be delivered to the wearer. For example advertisements may be displayed to the viewer through the eyepiece as the viewer is going about his or her day while browsing the Internet conducting a web search walking though a store and the like. For instance the user may be performing a web search and through the web search the user is targeted with an advertisement. In this example the advertisement may be projected in the same space as the projected web search floating off to the side above or below the view angle of the wearer. In another example advertisements may be triggered for delivery to the eyepiece when some advertising providing facility perhaps one in proximity to the wearer senses the presence of the eyepiece e.g. through a wireless connection RFID and the like and directs the advertisement to the eyepiece. In embodiments the eyepiece may be used for tracking of advertisement interactions such as the user seeing or interacting with a billboard a promotion an advertisement and the like. For instance user s behavior with respect to advertisements may be tracked such as to provide benefits rewards and the like to the user. In an example the user may be paid five dollars in virtual cash whenever they see a billboard. The eyepiece may provide impression tracking such as based on seeing branded images e.g. based on time geography and the like. As a result offers may be targeted based on the location and the event related to the eyepiece such as what the user saw heard interacted with and the like. In embodiments ad targeting may be based on historical behavior such as based on what the user has interacted with in the past patterns of interactions and the like.

For example the wearer may be window shopping in Manhattan where stores are equipped with such advertising providing facilities. As the wearer walks by the stores the advertising providing facilities may trigger the delivery of an advertisement to the wearer based on a known location of the user determined by an integrated location sensor of the eyepiece such as a GPS. In an embodiment the location of the user may be further refined via other integrated sensors such as a magnetometer to enable hyperlocal augmented reality advertising. For example a user on a ground floor of a mall may receive certain advertisements if the magnetometer and GPS readings place the user in front of a particular store. When the user goes up one flight in the mall the GPS location may remain the same but the magnetometer reading may indicate a change in elevation of the user and a new placement of the user in front of a different store. In embodiments one may store personal profile information such that the advertising providing facility is able to better match advertisements to the needs of the wearer the wearer may provide preferences for advertisements the wearer may block at least some of the advertisements and the like. The wearer may also be able to pass advertisements and associated discounts on to friends. The wearer may communicate them directly to friends that are in close proximity and enabled with their own eyepiece they may also communicate them through a wireless Internet connection such as to a social network of friends though email SMS and the like. The wearer may be connected to facilities and or infrastructure that enables the communication of advertisements from a sponsor to the wearer feedback from the wearer to an advertisement facility the sponsor of the advertisement and the like to other users such as friends and family or someone in proximity to the wearer to a store such as locally on the eyepiece or in a remote site such as on the Internet or on a user s home computer and the like. These interconnectivity facilities may include integrated facilities to the eyepiece to provide the user s location and gaze direction such as through the use of GPS 3 axis sensors magnetometer gyros accelerometers and the like for determining direction speed attitude e.g. gaze direction of the wearer. Interconnectivity facilities may provide telecommunications facilities such as cellular link a WiFi MiFi bridge and the like. For instance the wearer may be able to communicate through an available WiFi link through an integrated MiFi or any other personal or group cellular link to the cellular system and the like. There may be facilities for the wearer to store advertisements for a later use. There may be facilities integrated with the wearer s eyepiece or located in local computer facilities that enable caching of advertisements such as within a local area where the cached advertisements may enable the delivery of the advertisements as the wearer nears the location associated with the advertisement. For example local advertisements may be stored on a server that contains geo located local advertisements and specials and these advertisements may be delivered to the wearer individually as the wearer approaches a particular location or a set of advertisements may be delivered to the wearer in bulk when the wearer enters a geographic area that is associated with the advertisements so that the advertisements are available when the user nears a particular location. The geographic location may be a city a part of the city a number of blocks a single block a street a portion of the street sidewalk and the like representing regional local hyper local areas. Note that the preceding discussion uses the term advertisement but one skilled in the art will appreciate that this can also mean an announcement a broadcast a circular a commercial a sponsored communication an endorsement a notice a promotion a bulletin a message and the like.

As illustrated in the augmented reality enabled device such as the camera lens provided in the eyepiece may be utilized to receive and or view graffiti slogans drawings and the like that may be displayed on the roadside or on top side front of the buildings and shops. The roadside billboards and the graffiti may have a visual e.g. a code a shape or wireless indicator that may link the advertisement or advertisement database to the billboard. When the wearer nears and views the billboard a projection of the billboard advertisement may then be provided to the wearer. In embodiments one may also store personal profile information such that the advertisements may better match the needs of the wearer the wearer may provide preferences for advertisements the wearer may block at least some of the advertisements and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may have brightness and contrast control over the eyepiece projected area of the billboard so as to improve readability for the advertisement such as in a bright outside environment.

In other embodiments users may post information or messages on a particular location based on its GPS location or other indicator of location such as a magnetometer reading. The intended viewer is able to see the message when the viewer is within a certain distance of the location as explained with . In a first step of the method a user decides the location where the message is to be received by persons to whom the message is sent. The message is then posted to be sent to the appropriate person or persons when the recipient is close to the intended viewing area. Location of the wearers of the augmented reality eyepiece is continuously updated by the GPS system which forms a part of the eyepiece. When the GPS system determines that the wearer is within a certain distance of the desired viewing area e.g. 10 meters the message is then sent 2007 to the viewer. In one embodiment the message then appears as e mail or a text message to the recipient or if the recipient is wearing an eyepiece the message may appear in the eyepiece. Because the message is sent to the person based on the person s location in one sense the message may be displayed as graffiti on a building or feature at or near the specified location. Specific settings may be used to determine if all passersby to the viewing area can see the message or if only a specific person or group of people or devices with specific identifiers. For example a soldier clearing a village may virtually mark a house as cleared by associating a message or identifier with the house such as a big X marking the location of the house. The soldier may indicate that only other American soldiers may be able to receive the location based content. When other American soldiers pass the house they may receive an indication automatically such as by seeing the virtual X on the side of the house if they have an eyepiece or some other augmented reality enabled device or by receiving a message indicating that the house has been cleared. In another example content related to safety applications may be streamed to the eyepiece such as alerts target identification communications and the like.

Embodiments may provide for a way to view information associated with products such as in a store. Information may include nutritional information for food products care instructions for clothing products technical specifications for consumer electronics products e coupons promotions price comparisons with other like products price comparisons with other stores and the like. This information may be projected in relative position with the product to the periphery of sight to the wearer in relation to the store layout and the like. The product may be identified visually through a SKU a brand tag and the like transmitted by the product packaging such as through an RFID tag on the product transmitted by the store such as based on the wearer s position in the store in relative position to the products and the like.

For example a viewer may be walking though a clothing store and as they walk are provided with information on the clothes on the rack where the information is provided through the product s RFID tag. In embodiments the information may be delivered as a list of information as a graphic representation as audio and or video presentation and the like. In another example the wearer may be food shopping and advertisement providing facilities may be providing information to the wearer in association with products in the wearer s proximity the wearer may be provided information when they pick up the product and view the brand product name SKU and the like. In this way the wearer may be provided a more informative environment in which to effectively shop.

One embodiment may allow a user to receive or share information about shopping or an urban area through the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as the camera lens fitted in the eyepiece of exemplary sunglasses. These embodiments will use augmented reality AR software applications such as those mentioned above in conjunction with searching for providers of goods and services. In one scenario the wearer of the eyepiece may walk down a street or a market for shopping purposes. Further the user may activate various modes that may assist in defining user preferences for a particular scenario or environment. For example the user may enter navigation mode through which the wearer may be guided across the streets and the market for shopping of the preferred accessories and products. The mode may be selected and various directions may be given by the wearer through various methods such as through text commands voice commands and the like. In an embodiment the wearer may give a voice command to select the navigation mode which may result in the augmented display in front of the wearer. The augmented information may depict information pertinent to the location of various shops and vendors in the market offers in various shops and by various vendors current happy hours current date and time and the like. Various sorts of options may also be displayed to the wearer. The wearer may scroll the options and walk down the street guided through the navigation mode. Based on options provided the wearer may select a place that suits him the best for shopping based on such as offers and discounts and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may provide the ability to search browse select save share receive advertisements and the like for items of purchase such as viewed through the eyepiece. For example the wearer may search for an item across the Internet and make a purchase without making a phone call such as through an application store commerce application and the like.

The wearer may give a voice command to navigate toward the place and the wearer may then be guided toward it. The wearer may also receive advertisements and offers automatically or based on request regarding current deals promotions and events in the interested location such as a nearby shopping store. The advertisements deals and offers may appear in proximity of the wearer and options may be displayed for purchasing desired products based on the advertisements deals and offers. The wearer may for example select a product and purchase it through a Google checkout. A message or an email may appear on the eyepiece similar to the one depicted in with information that the transaction for the purchase of the product has been completed. A product delivery status information may also be displayed. The wearer may further convey or alert friends and relatives regarding the offers and events through social networking platforms and may also ask them to join.

In embodiments the user may wear the head mounted eyepiece wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user may view a surrounding environment and displayed content. The displayed content may comprise one or more local advertisements. The location of the eyepiece may be determined by an integrated location sensor and the local advertisement may have a relevance to the location of the eyepiece. By way of example the user s location may be determined via GPS RFID manual input and the like. Further the user may be walking by a coffee shop and based on the user s proximity to the shop an advertisement similar to that depicted in showing the store s brand such as the band for a fast food restaurant or coffee may appear in the user s field of view. The user may experience similar types of local advertisements as he or she moves about the surrounding environment.

In other embodiments the eyepiece may contain a capacitive sensor capable of sensing whether the eyepiece is in contact with human skin. Such sensor or group of sensors may be placed on the eyepiece and or eyepiece arm in such a manner that allows detection of when the glasses are being worn by a user. In other embodiments sensors may be used to determine whether the eyepiece is in a position such that they may be worn by a user for example when the earpiece is in the unfolded position. Furthermore local advertisements may be sent only when the eyepiece is in contact with human skin in a wearable position a combination of the two actually worn by the user and the like. In other embodiments the local advertisement may be sent in response to the eyepiece being powered on or in response to the eyepiece being powered on and worn by the user and the like. By way of example an advertiser may choose to only send local advertisements when a user is in proximity to a particular establishment and when the user is actually wearing the glasses and they are powered on allowing the advertiser to target the advertisement to the user at the appropriate time.

In accordance with other embodiments the local advertisement may be displayed to the user as a banner advertisement two dimensional graphic text and the like. Further the local advertisement may be associated with a physical aspect of the user s view of the surrounding environment. The local advertisement may also be displayed as an augmented reality advertisement wherein the advertisement is associated with a physical aspect of the surrounding environment. Such advertisement may be two or three dimensional. By way of example a local advertisement may be associated with a physical billboard as described further in wherein the user s attention may be drawn to displayed content showing a beverage being poured from a billboard onto an actual building in the surrounding environment. The local advertisement may also contain sound that is displayed to the user through an earpiece audio device or other means. Further the local advertisement may be animated in embodiments. For example the user may view the beverage flow from the billboard onto an adjacent building and optionally into the surrounding environment. Similarly an advertisement may display any other type of motion as desired in the advertisement. Additionally the local advertisement may be displayed as a three dimensional object that may be associated with or interact with the surrounding environment. In embodiments where the advertisement is associated with an object in the user s view of the surrounding environment the advertisement may remain associated with or in proximity to the object even as the user turns his head. For example if an advertisement such as the coffee cup as described in is associated with a particular building the coffee cup advertisement may remain associated with and in place over the building even as the user turns his head to look at another object in his environment.

In other embodiments local advertisements may be displayed to the user based on a web search conducted by the user where the advertisement is displayed in the content of the web search results. For example the user may search for happy hour as he is walking down the street and in the content of the search results a local advertisement may be displayed advertising a local bar s beer prices.

Further the content of the local advertisement may be determined based on the user s personal information. The user s information may be made available to a web application an advertising facility and the like. Further a web application advertising facility or the user s eyepiece may filter the advertising based on the user s personal information. Generally for example a user may store personal information about his likes and dislikes and such information may be used to direct advertising to the user s eyepiece. By way of specific example the user may store data about his affinity for a local sports team and as advertisements are made available those advertisements with his favorite sports team may be given preference and pushed to the user. Similarly a user s dislikes may be used to exclude certain advertisements from view. In various embodiments the advertisements may be cashed on a server where the advertisement may be accessed by at least one of an advertising facility web application and eyepiece and displayed to the user.

In various embodiments the user may interact with any type of local advertisement in numerous ways. The user may request additional information related to a local advertisement by making at least one action of an eye movement body movement and other gesture. For example if an advertisement is displayed to the user he may wave his hand over the advertisement in his field of view or move his eyes over the advertisement in order to select the particular advertisement to receive more information relating to such advertisement. Moreover the user may choose to ignore the advertisement by any movement or control technology described herein such as through an eye movement body movement other gesture and the like. Further the user may chose to ignore the advertisement by allowing it to be ignored by default by not selecting the advertisement for further interaction within a given period of time. For example if the user chooses not to gesture for more information from the advertisement within five seconds of the advertisement being displayed the advertisement may be ignored by default and disappear from the users view. Furthermore the user may select to not allow local advertisements to be displayed whereby said user selects such an option on a graphical user interface or by turning such feature off via a control on said eyepiece.

In other embodiments the eyepiece may include an audio device. Accordingly the displayed content may comprise a local advertisement and audio such that the user is also able to hear a message or other sound effects as they relate to the local advertisement. By way of example and referring again to while the user sees the beer being poured he will actually be able to hear an audio transmission corresponding to the actions in the advertisement. In this case the user may hear the bottle open and then the sound of the liquid pouring out of the bottle and onto the rooftop. In yet other embodiments a descriptive message may be played and or general information may be given as part of the advertisement. In embodiments any audio may be played as desired for the advertisement.

In accordance with another embodiment social networking may be facilitated with the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. This may be utilized to connect several users or other persons that may not have the augmented reality enabled device together who may share thoughts and ideas with each other. For instance the wearer of the eyepiece may be sitting in a school campus along with other students. The wearer may connect with and send a message to a first student who may be present in a coffee shop. The wearer may ask the first student regarding persons interested in a particular subject such as environmental economics for example. As other students pass through the field of view of the wearer the camera lens fitted inside the eyepiece may track and match the students to a networking database such as Google me that may contain public profiles. Profiles of interested and relevant persons from the public database may appear and pop up in front of the wearer on the eyepiece. Some of the profiles that may not be relevant may either be blocked or appear blocked to the user. The relevant profiles may be highlighted for quick reference of the wearer. The relevant profiles selected by the wearer may be interested in the subject environmental economics and the wearer may also connect with them. Further they may also be connected with the first student. In this manner a social network may be established by the wearer with the use of the eyepiece enabled with the feature of the augmented reality. The social networks managed by the wearer and the conversations therein may be saved for future reference.

The present disclosure may be applied in a real estate scenario with the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in an eyepiece. The wearer in accordance with this embodiment may want to get information about a place in which the user may be present at a particular time such as during driving walking jogging and the like. The wearer may for instance want to understand residential benefits and loss in that place. He may also want to get detailed information about the facilities in that place. Therefore the wearer may utilize a map such as a Google online map and recognize the real estate that may be available there for lease or purchase. As noted above the user may receive information about real estate for sale or rent using mobile Internet applications such as Layar. In one such application information about buildings within the user s field of view is projected onto the inside of the glasses for consideration by the user. Options may be displayed to the wearer on the eyepiece lens for scrolling such as with a trackpad mounted on a frame of the glasses. The wearer may select and receive information about the selected option. The augmented reality enabled scenes of the selected options may be displayed to the wearer and the wearer may be able to view pictures and take a facility tour in the virtual environment. The wearer may further receive information about real estate agents and fix an appointment with one of those. An email notification or a call notification may also be received on the eyepiece for confirmation of the appointment. If the wearer finds the selected real estate of worth a deal may be made and that may be purchased by the wearer.

In accordance with another embodiment customized and sponsored tours and travels may be enhanced through the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. For instance the wearer as a tourist may arrive in a city such as Paris and wants to receive tourism and sightseeing related information about the place to accordingly plan his visit for the consecutive days during his stay. The wearer may put on his eyepiece or operate any other augmented reality enabled device and give a voice or text command regarding his request. The augmented reality enabled eyepiece may locate wearer position through geo sensing techniques and decide tourism preferences of the wearer. The eyepiece may receive and display customized information based on the request of the wearer on a screen. The customized tourism information may include information about art galleries and museums monuments and historical places shopping complexes entertainment and nightlife spots restaurants and bars most popular tourist destinations and centers attractions of tourism most popular local cultural regional destinations and attractions and the like without limitations. Based on user selection of one or more of these categories the eyepiece may prompt the user with other questions such as time of stay investment in tourism and the like. The wearer may respond through the voice command and in return receive customized tour information in an order as selected by the wearer. For example the wearer may give a priority to the art galleries over monuments. Accordingly the information may be made available to the wearer. Further a map may also appear in front of the wearer with different sets of tour options and with different priority rank such as 

The wearer for instance may select the first option since it is ranked as highest in priority based on wearer indicated preferences. Advertisements related to sponsors may pop up right after selection. Subsequently a virtual tour may begin in the augmented reality manner that may be very close to the real environment. The wearer may for example take a 30 seconds tour to a vacation special to the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas. The virtual 3D tour may include a quick look at the rooms beach public spaces parks facilities and the like. The wearer may also experience shopping facilities in the area and receive offers and discounts in those places and shops. At the end of the day the wearer might have experienced a whole day tour sitting in his chamber or hotel. Finally the wearer may decide and schedule his plan accordingly.

Another embodiment may allow information concerning auto repairs and maintenance services with the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. The wearer may receive advertisements related to auto repair shops and dealers by sending a voice command for the request. The request may for example include a requirement of oil change in the vehicle car. The eyepiece may receive information from the repair shop and display to the wearer. The eyepiece may pull up a 3D model of the wearer s vehicle and show the amount of oil left in the car through an augmented reality enabled scene view. The eyepiece may show other relevant information also about the vehicle of the wearer such as maintenance requirements in other parts like brake pads. The wearer may see 3D view of the wearing brake pads and may be interested in getting those repaired or changed. Accordingly the wearer may schedule an appointment with a vendor to fix the problem via using the integrated wireless communication capability of the eyepiece. The confirmation may be received through an email or an incoming call alert on the eyepiece camera lens.

In accordance with another embodiment gift shopping may benefit through the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. The wearer may post a request for a gift for some occasion through a text or voice command. The eyepiece may prompt the wearer to answer his preferences such as type of gifts age group of the person to receive the gift cost range of the gift and the like. Various options may be presented to the user based on the received preferences. For instance the options presented to the wearer may be Cookie basket Wine and cheese basket Chocolate assortment Golfer s gift basket and the like.

The available options may be scrolled by the wearer and the best fit option may be selected via the voice command or text command. For example the wearer may select the Golfer s gift basket. A 3D view of the Golfer s gift basket along with a golf course may appear in front of the wearer. The virtual 3D view of the Golfer s gift basket and the golf course enabled through the augmented reality may be perceived very close to the real world environment. The wearer may finally respond to the address location and other similar queries prompted through the eyepiece. A confirmation may then be received through an email or an incoming call alert on the eyepiece camera lens.

Another application that may appeal to users is mobile on line gaming using the augmented reality glasses. These games may be computer video games such as those furnished by Electronic Arts Mobile UbiSoft and Activision Blizzard e.g. World of Warcraft WoW . Just as games and recreational applications are played on computers at home rather than computers at work augmented reality glasses may also use gaming applications. The screen may appear on an inside of the glasses so that a user may observe the game and participate in the game. In addition controls for playing the game may be provided through a virtual game controller such as a joystick control module or mouse described elsewhere herein. The game controller may include sensors or other output type elements attached to the user s hand such as for feedback from the user through acceleration vibration force pressure electrical impulse temperature electric field sensing and the like. Sensors and actuators may be attached to the user s hand by way of a wrap ring pad glove bracelet and the like. As such an eyepiece virtual mouse may allow the user to translate motions of the hand wrist and or fingers into motions of the cursor on the eyepiece display where motions may include slow movements rapid motions jerky motions position change in position and the like and may allow users to work in three dimensions without the need for a physical surface and including some or all of the six degrees of freedom.

As seen in gaming application implementations may use both the internet and a GPS. In one embodiment a game is downloaded from a customer database via a game provider perhaps using their web services and the internet as shown to a user computer or augmented reality glasses. At the same time the glasses which also have telecommunication capabilities receive and send telecommunications and telemetry signals via a cellular tower and a satellite. Thus an on line gaming system has access to information about the user s location as well as the user s desired gaming activities.

Games may take advantage of this knowledge of the location of each player. For example the games may build in features that use the player s location via a GPS locator or magnetometer locator to award points for reaching the location. The game may also send a message e.g. display a clue or a scene or images when a player reaches a particular location. A message for example may be to go to a next destination which is then provided to the player. Scenes or images may be provided as part of a struggle or an obstacle which must be overcome or as an opportunity to earn game points. Thus in one embodiment augmented reality eyepieces or glasses may use the wearer s location to quicken and enliven computer based video games.

One method of playing augmented reality games is depicted in . In this method a user logs into a website whereby access to a game is permitted. The game is selected. In one example the user may join a game if multiple player games are available and desired alternatively the user may create a custom game perhaps using special roles the user desired. The game may be scheduled and in some instances players may select a particular time and place for the game distribute directions to the site where the game will be played etc. Later the players meet and check into the game with one or more players using the augmented reality glasses. Participants then play the game and if applicable the game results and any statistics scores of the players game times etc. may be stored. Once the game has begun the location may change for different players in the game sending one player to one location and another player or players to a different location. The game may then have different scenarios for each player or group of players based on their GPS or magnetometer provided locations. Each player may also be sent different messages or images based on his or her role his or her location or both. Of course each scenario may then lead to other situations other interactions directions to other locations and so forth. In one sense such a game mixes the reality of the player s location with the game in which the player is participating.

Games can range from simple games of the type that would be played in a palm of a player s hand such as small single player games. Alternatively more complicated multi player games may also be played. In the former category are games such as SkySiege AR Drone and Fire Fighter 360. In addition multiplayer games are also easily envisioned. Since all players must log into the game a particular game may be played by friends who log in and specify the other person or persons. The location of the players is also available via GPS or other method. Sensors in the augmented reality glasses or in a game controller as described above such as accelerometers gyroscopes or even a magnetic compass may also be used for orientation and game playing. An example is AR Invaders available for iPhone applications from the App Store. Other games may be obtained from other vendors and for non iPhone type systems such as Layar of Amsterdam and Paris SA Paris France supplier of AR Drone AR Flying Ace and AR Pursuit.

In embodiments games may also be in 3D such that the user can experience 3D gaming. For example when playing a 3D game the user may view a virtual augmented reality or other environment where the user is able to control his view perspective. The user may turn his head to view various aspects of the virtual environment or other environment. As such when the user turns his head or makes other movements he may view the game environment as if he were actually in such environment. For example the perspective of the user may be such that the user is put into a 3D game environment with at least some control over the viewing perspective where the user may be able to move his head and have the view of the game environment change in correspondence to the changed head position. Further the user may be able to walk into the game when he physically walks forward and have the perspective change as the user moves. Further the perspective may also change as the user moves the gazing view of his eyes and the like. Additional image information may be provided such as at the sides of the user s view that could be accessed by turning the head.

In embodiments the 3D game environment may be projected onto the lenses of the glasses or viewed by other means. Further the lenses may be opaque or transparent. In embodiments the 3D game image may be associated with and incorporate the external environment of the user such that the user may be able to turn his head and the 3D image and external environment stay together. Further such 3D gaming image and external environment associations may change such that the 3D image associates with more than one object or more than one part of an object in the external environment at various instances such that it appears to the user that the 3D image is interacting with various aspects or objects of the actual environment. By way of example the user may view a 3D game monster climb up a building or on to an automobile where such building or automobile is an actual object in the user s environment. In such a game the user may interact with the monster as part of the 3D gaming experience. The actual environment around the user may be part of the 3D gaming experience. In embodiments where the lenses are transparent the user may interact in a 3D gaming environment while moving about his or her actual environment. The 3D game may incorporate elements of the user s environment into the game it may be wholly fabricated by the game or it may be a mixture of both.

In embodiments the 3D images may be associated with or generated by an augmented reality program 3D game software and the like or by other means. In embodiments where augmented reality is employed for the purpose of 3D gaming a 3D image may appear or be perceived by the user based on the user s location or other data. Such an augmented reality application may provide for the user to interact with such 3D image or images to provide a 3D gaming environment when using the glasses. As the user changes his location for example play in the game may advance and various 3D elements of the game may become accessible or inaccessible to the viewer. By way of example various 3D enemies of the user s game character may appear in the game based on the actual location of the user. The user may interact with or cause reactions from other users playing the game and or 3D elements associated with the other users playing the game. Such elements associated with users may include weapons messages currency a 3D image of the user and the like. Based on a user s location or other data he or she may encounter view or engage by any means other users and 3D elements associated with other users. In embodiments 3D gaming may also be provided by software installed in or downloaded to the glasses where the user s location is or is not used.

In embodiments the lenses may be opaque to provide the user with a virtual reality or other virtual 3D gaming experience where the user is put into the game where the user s movements may change the viewing perspective of the 3D gaming environment for the user. The user may move through or explore the virtual environment through various body head and or eye movements use of game controllers one or more touch screens or any of the control techniques described herein which may allow the user to navigate manipulate and interact with the 3D environment and thereby play the 3D game.

In various embodiments the user may navigate interact with and manipulate the 3D game environment and experience 3D gaming via body hand finger eye or other movements through the use of one or more wired or wireless controllers one or more touch screens any of the control techniques described herein and the like.

In embodiments internal and external facilities available to the eyepiece may provide for learning the behavior of a user of the eyepiece and storing that learned behavior in a behavioral database to enable location aware control activity aware control predictive control and the like. For example a user may have events and or tracking of actions recorded by the eyepiece such as commands from the user images sensed through a camera GPS location of the user sensor inputs over time triggered actions by the user communications to and from the user user requests web activity music listened to directions requested recommendations used or provided and the like. This behavioral data may be stored in a behavioral database such as tagged with a user identifier or autonomously. The eyepiece may collect this data in a learn mode collection mode and the like. The eyepiece may utilize past data taken by the user to inform or remind the user of what they did before or alternatively the eyepiece may utilize the data to predict what eyepiece functions and applications the user may need based on past collected experiences. In this way the eyepiece may act as an automated assistant to the user for example launching applications at the usual time the user launches them turning off augmented reality and the GPS when nearing a location or entering a building streaming in music when the user enters the gym and the like. Alternately the learned behavior and or actions of a plurality of eyepiece users may be autonomously stored in a collective behavior database where learned behaviors amongst the plurality of users are available to individual users based on similar conditions. For example a user may be visiting a city and waiting for a train on a platform and the eyepiece of the user accesses the collective behavior database to determine what other users have done while waiting for the train such as getting directions searching for points of interest listening to certain music looking up the train schedule contacting the city website for travel information connecting to social networking sites for entertainment in the area and the like. In this way the eyepiece may be able to provide the user with an automated assistant with the benefit of many different user experiences. In embodiments the learned behavior may be used to develop preference profiles recommendations advertisement targeting social network contacts behavior profiles for the user or groups of users and the like for to the user.

In an embodiment the augmented reality eyepiece or glasses may include one or more acoustic sensors for detecting sound . An example is depicted above in . In one sense acoustic sensors are similar to microphones in that they detect sounds. Acoustic sensors typically have one or more frequency bandwidths at which they are more sensitive and the sensors can thus be chosen for the intended application. Acoustic sensors are available from a variety of manufacturers and are available with appropriate transducers and other required circuitry. Manufacturers include ITT Electronic Systems Salt Lake City Utah USA Meggitt Sensing Systems San Juan Capistrano Calif. USA and National Instruments Austin Tex. USA. Suitable microphones include those which comprise a single microphone as well as those which comprise an array of microphones or a microphone array.

Acoustic sensors may include those using micro electromechanical systems MEMS technology. Because of the very fine structure in a MEMS sensor the sensor is extremely sensitive and typically has a wide range of sensitivity. MEMS sensors are typically made using semiconductor manufacturing techniques. An element of a typical MEMS accelerometer is a moving beam structure composed of two sets of fingers. One set is fixed to a solid ground plane on a substrate the other set is attached to a known mass mounted on springs that can move in response to an applied acceleration. This applied acceleration changes the capacitance between the fixed and moving beam fingers. The result is a very sensitive sensor. Such sensors are made for example by STMicroelectronics Austin Tex. and Honeywell International Morristown N.J. USA.

In addition to identification sound capabilities of the augmented reality devices may also be applied to locating an origin of a sound. As is well known at least two sound or acoustic sensors are needed to locate a sound. The acoustic sensor will be equipped with appropriate transducers and signal processing circuits such as a digital signal processor for interpreting the signal and accomplishing a desired goal. One application for sound locating sensors may be to determine the origin of sounds from within an emergency location such as a burning building an automobile accident and the like. Emergency workers equipped with embodiments described herein may each have one or more than one acoustic sensors or microphones embedded within the frame. Of course the sensors could also be worn on the person s clothing or even attached to the person. In any event the signals are transmitted to the controller of the augmented reality eyepiece. The eyepiece or glasses are equipped with GPS technology and may also be equipped with direction finding capabilities alternatively with two sensors per person the microcontroller can determine a direction from which the noise originated.

If there are two or more firefighters or other emergency responders their location is known from their GPS capabilities. Either of the two or a fire chief or the control headquarters then knows the position of two responders and the direction from each responder to the detected noise. The exact point of origin of the noise can then be determined using known techniques and algorithms. See e.g. Acoustic Vector Sensor Beamforming and Capon Direction Estimation M. Hawkes and A. Nehorai IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing vol. 46 no. 9 September 1998 at 2291 2304 see also Cram r Rao Bounds for Direction Finding by an Acoustic Vector Sensor Under Nonideal Gain Phase Responses Noncollocation or Nonorthogonal Orientation P. K. Tam and K. T. Wong IEEE Sensors Journal vol. 9. No. 8 August 2009 at 969 982. The techniques used may include timing differences differences in time of arrival of the parameter sensed acoustic velocity differences and sound pressure differences. Of course acoustic sensors typically measure levels of sound pressure e.g. in decibels and these other parameters may be used in appropriate types of acoustic sensors including acoustic emission sensors and ultrasonic sensors or transducers.

The appropriate algorithms and all other necessary programming may be stored in the microcontroller of the eyepiece or in memory accessible to the eyepiece. Using more than one responder or several responders a likely location may then be determined and the responders can attempt to locate the person to be rescued. In other applications responders may use these acoustic capabilities to determine the location of a person of interest to law enforcement. In still other applications a number of people on maneuvers may encounter hostile fire including direct fire line of sight or indirect fire out of line of sight including high angle fire . The same techniques described here may be used to estimate a location of the hostile fire. If there are several persons in the area the estimation may be more accurate especially if the persons are separated at least to some extent over a wider area. This may be an effective tool to direct counter battery or counter mortar fire against hostiles. Direct fire may also be used if the target is sufficiently close.

An example using embodiments of the augmented reality eyepieces is depicted in . In this example B numerous soldiers are on patrol each equipped with augmented reality eyepieces and are alert for hostile fire. The sounds detected by their acoustic sensors or microphones may be relayed to a squad vehicle as shown to their platoon leader or to a remote tactical operations center TOC or command post CP . Alternatively or in addition to these the signals may also be sent to a mobile device such as an airborne platform as shown. Communications among the soldiers and the additional locations may be facilitated using a local area network or other network. In addition all the transmitted signals may be protected by encryption or other protective measures. One or more of the squad vehicle the platoon commander the mobile platform the TOC or the CP will have an integration capability for combining the inputs from the several soldiers and determining a possible location of the hostile fire. The signals from each soldier will include the location of the soldier from a GPS capability inherent in the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece. The acoustic sensors on each soldier may indicate a possible direction of the noise. Using signals from several soldiers the direction and possibly the location of the hostile fire may be determined. The soldiers may then neutralize the location.

In addition to microphones the augmented reality eyepiece may be equipped with ear buds which may be articulating ear buds as mentioned else where herein and may be removably attached or may be equipped with an audio output jack . The eyepiece and ear buds may be equipped to deliver noise cancelling interference allowing the user to better hear sounds delivered from the audio video communications capabilities of the augmented reality eyepiece or glasses and may feature automatic gain control. The speakers or ear buds of the augmented reality eyepiece may also connect with the full audio and visual capabilities of the device with the ability to deliver high quality and clear sound from the included telecommunications device. As noted elsewhere herein this includes radio or cellular telephone smart phone audio capabilities and may also include complementary technologies such as Bluetooth capabilities or related technologies such as IEEE 802.11 for wireless personal area networks WPAN .

Another aspect of the augmented audio capabilities includes speech recognition and identification capabilities. Speech recognition concerns understanding what is said while speech identification concerns understanding who the speaker is. Speech identification may work hand in hand with the facial recognition capabilities of these devices to more positively identify persons of interest. As described elsewhere in this document a camera connected as part of the augmented reality eyepiece can unobtrusively focus on desired personnel such as a single person in a crowd or multiple faces in a crowd. Using the camera and appropriate facial recognition software an image of the person or people may be taken. The features of the image are then broken down into any number of measurements and statistics and the results are compared to a database of known persons. An identity may then be made. In the same manner a voice or voice sampling from the person of interest may be taken. The sample may be marked or tagged e.g. at a particular time interval and labeled e.g. a description of the person s physical characteristics or a number. The voice sample may be compared to a database of known persons and if the person s voice matches then an identification may be made. In embodiments multiple individuals of interest may by selected such as for biometric identification. The multiple selection may be through the use of a cursor a hand gesture an eye movement and the like. As a result of the multiple selection information concerning the selected individuals may be provided to the user such as through the display through audio and the like.

In embodiments where the camera is used for biometric identification of multiple people in a crowd control technologies described herein may be used to select faces or irises for imaging. For example a cursor selection using the hand worn control device may be used to select multiple faces in a view of the user s surrounding environment. In another example gaze tracking may be used to select which faces to select for biometric identification. In another example the hand worn control device may sense a gesture used to select the individuals such as pointing at each individual.

In one embodiment important characteristics of a particular person s speech may be understood from a sample or from many samples of the person s voice. The samples are typically broken into segments frames and subframes. Typically important characteristics include a fundamental frequency of the person s voice energy formants speaking rate and the like. These characteristics are analyzed by software which analyses the voice according to certain formulae or algorithms. This field is constantly changing and improving. However currently such classifiers may include algorithms such as neural network classifiers k classifiers hidden Markov models Gaussian mixture models and pattern matching algorithms among others.

A general template for speech recognition and speaker identification is depicted in . A first step is to provide a speech signal. Ideally one has a known sample from prior encounters with which to compare the signal. The signal is then digitized in step and is partitioned in step into fragments such as segments frames and subframes. Features and statistics of the speech sample are then generated and extracted in step . The classifier or more than one classifier is then applied in step to determine general classifications of the sample. Post processing of the sample may then be applied in step e.g. to compare the sample to known samples for possible matching and identification. The results may then be output in step . The output may be directed to the person requesting the matching and may also be recorded and sent to other persons and to one or more databases.

In an embodiment the audio capabilities of the eyepiece include hearing protection with the associated earbuds. The audio processor of the eyepiece may enable automatic noise suppression such as if a loud noise is detected near the wearer s head. Any of the control technologies described herein may be used with automatic noise suppression.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may include a nitinol head strap. The head strap may be a thin band of curved metal which may either pull out from the arms of the eyepiece or rotate out and extend out to behind the head to secure the eyepiece to the head. In one embodiment the tip of the nitinol strap may have a silicone cover such that the silicone cover is grasped to pull out from the ends of the arms. In embodiments only one arm has a nitinol band and it gets secured to the other arm to form a strap. In other embodiments both arms have a nitinol band and both sides get pulled out to either get joined to form a strap or independently grasp a portion of the head to secure the eyepiece on the wearer s head. In embodiments the eyepiece may have interchangeable equipment to attach the eyepiece to an individual s head such as a joint where a head strap glasses arms helmet strap helmet snap connection and the like may be attached. For example there may be a joint in the eyepiece near the user s temple where the eyepiece may attach to a strap and where the strap may be disconnected so the user may attach arms to make the eyepiece take the form of glasses attach to a helmet and the like. In embodiments the interchangeable equipment attaching the eyepiece to the user s head or to a helmet may include an embedded antenna. For example a Nitinol head strap may have an embedded antenna inside such as for a particular frequency for a plurality of frequencies and the like. In addition the arm strap and the like may contain RF absorbing foam in order to aid in the absorption of RF energy while the antenna is used in transmission.

Referring to the eyepiece may include one or more adjustable wrap around extendable arms . The adjustable wrap around extendable arms may secure the position of the eyepiece to the user s head. One or more of the extendable arms may be made out of a shape memory material. In embodiments one or both of the arms may be made of nitinol and or any shape memory material. In other instances the end of at least one of the wrap around extendable arms may be covered with silicone. Further the adjustable wrap around extendable arms may extend from the end of an eyepiece arm . They may extend telescopically and or they may slide out from an end of the eyepiece arms. They may slide out from the interior of the eyepiece arms or they may slide along an exterior surface of the eyepiece arms . Further the extendable arms may meet and secure to each other. The extendable arms may also attach to another portion of the head mounted eyepiece to create a means for securing the eyepiece to the user s head. The wrap around extendable arms may meet to secure to each other interlock connect magnetically couple or secure by other means so as to provide a secure attachment to the user s head. In embodiments the adjustable wrap around extendable arms may also be independently adjusted to attach to or grasp portions of the user s head. As such the independently adjustable arms may allow the user increased customizability for a personalized fit to secure the eyepiece to the user s head. Further in embodiments at least one of the wrap around extendable arms may be detachable from the head mounted eyepiece. In yet other embodiments the wrap around extendable arms may be an add on feature of the head mounted eyepiece. In such instances the user may chose to put extendable non extendable or other arms on to the head mounted eyepiece. For example the arms may be sold as a kit or part of a kit that allows the user to customize the eyepiece to his or her specific preferences. Accordingly the user may customize that type of material from which the adjustable wrap around extendable arm is made by selecting a different kit with specific extendable arms suited to his preferences. Accordingly the user may customize his eyepiece for his particular needs and preferences.

In yet other embodiments an adjustable strap may be attached to the eyepiece arms such that it extends around the back of the user s head in order to secure the eyepiece in place. The strap may be adjusted to a proper fit. It may be made out of any suitable material including but not limited to rubber silicone plastic cotton and the like.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may be secured to the user s head by a plurality of other structures such a rigid arm a flexible arm a gooseneck flex arm a cable tensioned system and the like. For instance a flexible arm may be constructed from a flexible tubing such as in a gooseneck configuration where the flexible arm may be flexed into position to adjust to the fit of a given user and where the flexible arm may be reshaped as needed. In another instance a flexible arm may be constructed from a cable tensioned system such as in a robotic finger configuration having multiple joints connecting members that are bent into a curved shape with a pulling force applied to a cable running through the joints and members. In this case the cable driven system may implement an articulating ear horn for size adjustment and eyepiece headwear retention. The cable tensioned system may have two or more linkages the cable may be stainless steel Nitinol based electro actuated ratcheted wheel adjusted and the like.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may include security features such as M Shield Security Secure content DSM Secure Runtime IPSec and the like. Other software features may include User Interface Apps Framework BSP Codecs Integration Testing System Validation and the like.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may be able to access a 3G access point that includes a 3G radio an 802.11b connection and a Bluetooth connection to enable hopping data from a device to a 3G enable embodiment of the eyepiece.

The present disclosure also relates to methods and apparatus for the capture of biometric data about individuals. The methods and apparatus provide wireless capture of fingerprints iris patterns facial structure and other unique biometric features of individuals and then send the data to a network or directly to the eyepiece. Data collected from an individual may also be compared with previously collected data and used to identify a particular individual.

In embodiments the eyepiece may be associated with mobile biometric devices such as a biometric flashlight a biometric phone a biometric camera a pocket biometric device an arm strap biometric device and the like where the mobile biometrics device may act as a stand alone device or in communications with the eyepiece such as for control of the device display of data from the device storage of data linking to an external system linking to other eyepieces and or other mobile biometrics devices and the like. The mobile biometrics device may enable a soldier or other non military personnel to collect or utilize existing biometrics to profile an individual. The device may provide for tracking monitoring and collecting biometric records such as including video voice gait face iris biometrics and the like. The device may provide for geo location tags for collected data such as with time date location data taking personnel the environment and the like. The device may be able to capture and record fingerprints palm prints scars marks tattoos audio video annotations and the like such as utilizing a thin film sensor recording collecting identifying and verifying face fingerprint iris latent fingerprints latent palm prints voice pocket litter and other identifying visible marks and environmental data. The device may be able to read prints wet or dry. The device may include a camera such as with IR illumination UV illumination and the like with a capability to see through dust smoke haze and the like. The camera may support dynamic range extension adaptive defect pixel correction advanced sharpness enhancement geometric distortion correction advanced color management hardware based face detection video stabilization and the like. In embodiments the camera output may be transmitted to the eyepiece for presentation to the soldier. The device may accommodate a plurality of other sensors such as described herein including an accelerometer compass ambient light proximity barometric and temperature sensors and the like depending on requirements. The device may also have a mosaic print sensor as described herein producing high resolution images of the whorls and pores of an individual s fingerprint multiple finger prints simultaneously palm print and the like. A soldier may utilize a mobile biometrics device to more easily collect personnel information such as for document and media exploitation DOMEX . For instance during an interview enrollment interrogations and the like operators may photograph and read identifying data or pocket litter e.g. passport ID cards personal documents cell phone directories pictures take biometric data and the like into a person of interest profile that may be entered into a searchable secure database. In embodiments biometric data may be filed using the most salient image plus manual entry enabling partial data capture. Data may be automatically geo located time date stamped filed into a digital dossier and the like such as with a locally or network assigned global unique identifier GUID . For instance a face image may be captured at the scene of an IED bombing the left iris image may be captured at a scene of a suicide bombing latent fingerprints may be lifted from a sniper rifle each taken from a different mobile biometrics device at different locations and times and together identifying a person of interest from the multiple inputs such as at a random vehicle inspection point.

A further embodiment of the eyepiece may be used to provide biometric data collection and result reporting. Biometric data may be visual biometric data such as facial biometric data or iris biometric data or may be audio biometric data. depicts an embodiment providing biometric data capture. The assembly incorporates the eyepiece discussed above in connection with . Eyepiece provides an interactive head mounted eyepiece that includes an optical assembly. Other eyepieces providing similar functionality may also be used. Eyepieces may also incorporate global positioning system capability to permit location information display and reporting.

The optical assembly allows a user to view the surrounding environment including individuals in the vicinity of the wearer. An embodiment of the eyepiece allows a user to biometrically identify nearby individuals using facial images and iris images or both facial and iris images or audio samples. The eyepiece incorporates a corrective element that corrects a user s view of the surrounding environment and also displays content provided to the user through in integrated processor and image source. The integrated image source introduces the content to be displayed to the user to the optical assembly.

The eyepiece also includes an optical sensor for capturing biometric data. The integrated optical sensor in an embodiment may incorporate a camera mounted on the eyepiece. This camera is used to capture biometric images of an individual near the user of the eyepiece. The user directs the optical sensor or the camera toward a nearby individual by positioning the eyepiece in the appropriate direction which may be done just by looking at the individual. The user may select whether to capture one or more of a facial image an iris image or an audio sample.

The biometric data that may be captured by the eyepiece illustrated in includes facial images for facial recognition iris images for iris recognition and audio samples for voice identification. The eyepiece incorporates multiple microphones in an endfire array disposed along both the right and left temples of the eyepiece. The microphone arrays are specifically tuned to enable capture of human voices in an environment with a high level of ambient noise. The microphones may be directional steerable and covert. Microphones provide selectable options for improved audio capture including omni directional operation or directional beam operation. Directional beam operation allows a user to record audio samples from a specific individual by steering the microphone array in the direction of the subject individual. Adaptive microphone arrays may be created that will allow the operator to steer the directionality of the microphone array in three dimensions where the directional beam may be adjusted in real time to maximize signal or minimize interfering noise for a non stationary target. Array processing may allow summing of cardioid elements by analog or digital means where there may be switching between omni and directional array operations. In embodiments beam forming array steering adaptive array processing speech source location and the like may be performed by the on board processor. In an embodiment the microphone may be capable of 10 dB directional recording.

Audio biometric capture is enhanced by incorporating phased array audio and video tracking for audio and video capture. Audio tracking allows for continuing to capture an audio sample when the target individual is moving in an environment with other noise sources. In embodiments the user s voice may be subtracted from the audio track so as to enable a clearer rendition of the target individual such as for distinguishing what is being said to provide better location tracking to provide better audio tracking and the like.

To provide power for the display optics and biometric data collection the eyepiece also incorporates a lithium ion battery that is capable of operating for over twelve hours on a single charge. In addition the eyepiece also incorporates a processor and solid state memory for processing the captured biometric data. The processor and memory are configurable to function with any software or algorithm used as part of a biometric capture protocol or format such as the .wav format.

A further embodiment of the eyepiece assembly provides an integrated communications facility that transmits the captured biometric data to a remote facility that stores the biometric data in a biometric data database. The biometric data database interprets the captured biometric data interprets the data and prepares content for display on the eyepiece.

In operation a wearer of the eyepiece desiring to capture biometric data from a nearby observed individual positions himself or herself so that the individual appears in the field of view of the eyepiece. Once in position the user initiates capture of biometric information. Biometric information that may be captured includes iris images facial images and audio data.

In operation a wearer of the eyepiece desiring to capture audio biometric data from a nearby observed individual positions himself or herself so that the individual appears is near the eyepiece specifically near the microphone arrays located in the eyepiece temples. Once in position the user initiates capture of audio biometric information. This audio biometric information consists of a recorded sample of the target individual speaking. Audio samples may be captured in conjunction with visual biometric data such as iris and facial images.

To capture an iris image the wearer user observes the desired individual and positions the eyepiece such that the optical sensor assembly or camera may collect an image of the biometric parameters of the desired individual. Once captured the eyepiece processor and solid state memory prepare the captured image for transmission to the remote computing facility for further processing.

The remote computing facility receives the transmitted biometric image and compares the transmitted image to previously captured biometric data of the same type. Iris or facial images are compared with previously collected iris or facial images to determine if the individual has been previously encountered and identified.

Once the comparison has been made the remote computing facility transmits a report of the comparison to the wearer user s eyepiece for display. The report may indicate that the captured biometric image matches previously captured images. In such cases the user receives a report including the identity of the individual along with other identifying information or statistics. Not all captured biometric data allows for an unambiguous determination of identity. In such cases the remote computing facility provides a report of findings and may request the user to collect additional biometric data possibly of a different type to aid in the identification and comparison process. Visual biometric data may be supplemented with audio biometric data as a further aid to identification.

Facial images are captured in a similar manner as iris images. The field of view is necessarily larger due to the size of the images collected. This also permits to user to stand further off from the subject whose facial biometric data is being captured.

In operation the user may have originally captured a facial image of the individual. However the facial image may be incomplete or inconclusive because the individual may be wearing clothing or other apparel such as a hat that obscures facial features. In such a case the remote computing facility may request that a different type of biometric capture be used and additional images or data be transmitted. In the case described above the user may be directed to obtain an iris image to supplement the captured facial image. In other instances the additional requested data may be an audio sample of the individual s voice.

The multiple microphones may be arranged in a composite microphone array. Instead of using one standard high quality microphone to capture an audio sample the eyepiece temple pieces house multiple microphones of different character. For example this may be provided when the user is generating a biometric fingerprint of someone s voice for future capture and comparison. One example of multiple microphone use uses microphones from cut off cell phones to reproduce the exact electrical and acoustic properties of the individual s voice. This sample is stored for future comparison in a database. If the individual s voice is later captured the earlier sample is available for comparison and will be reported to the eyepiece user as the acoustic properties of the two samples will match.

In an embodiment the integrated camera may continuously record a video file and the integrated microphone may continuously record an audio file. The integrated processor of the eyepiece may enable event tagging in long sections of the continuous audio or video recording. For example a full day of passive recording may be tagged whenever an event conversation encounter or other item of interest takes place. Tagging may be accomplished through the explicit press of a button a noise or physical tap a hand gesture or any other control technique described herein. A marker may be placed in the audio or video file or stored in a metadata header. In embodiments the marker may include the GPS coordinate of the event conversation encounter or other item of interest. In other embodiments the marker may be time synced with a GPS log of the day. Other logic based triggers can also tag the audio or video file such as proximity relationships to other users devices locations or the like. Event tags may be active event tags that the user triggers manually passive event tags that occur automatically such as through preprogramming through an event profile management facility and the like a location sensitive tag triggered by the user s location and the like. The event that triggers the event tag may be triggered by a sound a sight a visual marker received from a network connection an optical trigger an acoustic trigger a proximity trigger a temporal trigger a geo spatial trigger and the like. The event trigger may generate feedback to the user such as an audio tone a visual indicator a message and the like store information such as storing a file document entry in a listing an audio file a video file and the like generate an informational transmission and the like.

In an embodiment the eyepiece may be used as SigInt Glasses. Using one or more of an integrated WiFi 3G or Bluetooth radios the eyepiece may be used to conspicuously and passively gather signals intelligence for devices and individuals in the user s proximity. Signals intelligence may be gathered automatically or may be triggered when a particular device ID is in proximity when a particular audio sample is detected when a particular geo location has been reached and the like.

In one embodiment the laser range finder may be a 1.55 micron eye safe laser range finder.

The eyepiece may utilize GPS and inertial navigation e.g. utilizing an inertial measurement unit as described herein such as described herein to provide positional and directional accuracy. However the eyepiece may utilize additional sensors and associated algorithms to enhance positional and directional accuracy such as with a 3 axis digital compass inclinometer accelerometer gyroscope and the like. For instance a military operation may require greater positional accuracy then is available from GPS and so other navigation sensors may be utilized in combination to increase the positional accuracy of GPS.

The tactical glasses may feature enhanced resolution such as 1280 1024 pixels and may also feature auto focus.

This provides valuable situational and environmental data can be rapidly disseminated to all networked personnel as well as command posts CPs and tactical operations centers TOCs .

In embodiments the eyepiece may be able to sense lasers such as used in battlefield targeting. For instance sensors in the eyepiece may be able to detect laser light in typical military use laser transmission bands such as 1064 nm 1550 nm and the like. In this way the eyepiece may be able to detect whether their position is being targeted if another location is being targeted the location of a spotter using the laser as a targeting aid and the like. Further since the eyepiece may be able to sense laser light such as directly or reflected the soldier may not only detect enemy laser sources that have been directed or reflected to their position but may supply the laser source themselves in order to locate optical surfaces e.g. binoculars in the battlefield scene. For example the soldier scans the field with a laser and watches with the eyepiece for a reflected return of the laser as a possible location of an enemy viewing though binoculars. In embodiments the eyepiece may continuously scan the surrounding environment for laser light and provide feedback and or action as a result of a detection such as an audible alarm to the soldier a location indicted through a visual indicator on the eyepiece display and the like.

The discussion above pertains to methods of gathering biometric data such as fingerprints or palm prints using a platen or touch screen as shown in FIGS. and . This disclosure also includes methods and systems for touchless or contactless fingerprinting using polarized light. In one embodiment fingerprints may be taken by persons using a polarized light source and retrieving images of the fingerprints using reflected polarized light in two planes. In another embodiment fingerprints may be taken by persons using a light source and retrieving images of the fingerprints using multispectral processing e.g. using two imagers at two different locations with different inputs. The different inputs may be caused by using different filters or different sensors imagers. Applications of this technology may include biometric checks of unknown persons or subjects in which the safety of the persons doing the checking may be at issue.

In this method an unknown person or subject may approach a checkpoint for example to be allowed further travel to his or her destination. As depicted in the system shown in the person P and an appropriate body part such as a hand a palm P or other part are illuminated by a source of polarized light . As is well known to those with skill in optical arts the source of polarized light may simply be a lamp or other source of illumination with a polarizing filter to emit light that is polarized in one plane. The light travels to the person in an area which has been specified for non contact fingerprinting so that the polarized light impinges on the fingers or other body part of the person P. The incident polarized light is then reflected from the fingers or other body part and passes in all directions from the person. Two imagers or cameras receive the reflected light after the light has passed through optical elements such as a lens and a polarizing filter . The cameras or imagers may be mounted on the augmented reality glasses as discussed above with respect to .

The light then passes from palm or finger or fingers of the person of interest to two different polarizing filters and then to the imagers or cameras . Light which has passed through the polarizing filters may have a 90 orientation difference horizontal and vertical or other orientation difference such as 30 45 60 or 120 . The cameras may be digital cameras with appropriate digital imaging sensors to convert the incident light into appropriate signals. The signals are then processed by appropriate processing circuitry such as digital signal processors. The signals may then be combined in a conventional manner such as by a digital microprocessor with memory . The digital processor with appropriate memory is programmed to produce data suitable for an image of a palm fingerprint or other image as desired. The digital data from the imagers may then be combined in this process for example using the techniques of U.S. Pat. No. 6 249 616 and others. As noted above in the present disclosure the combined image may then be checked against a database to determine an identity of the person. The augmented reality glasses may include such a database in the memory or may refer the signals data elsewhere for comparison and checking.

A process for taking contactless fingerprints palm prints or other biometric prints is disclosed in the flowchart of . In one embodiment a polarized light source is provided . In a second step the person of interest and the selected body part is positioned for illumination by the light. In another embodiment it may be possible to use incident white light rather than using a polarized light source. When the image is ready to be taken light is reflected from the person to two cameras or imagers. A polarizing filter is placed in front of each of the two cameras so that the light received by the cameras is polarized in two different planes such as in a horizontal and vertical plane. Each camera then detects the polarized light. The cameras or other sensors then convert the incidence of light into signals or data suitable for preparation of images. Finally the images are then combined to form a very distinct reliable print. The result is an image of very high quality that may be compared to digital databases to identify the person and to detect persons of interest.

It should be understood that while digital cameras are used in this contactless system other imagers may be used such as active pixel imagers CMOS imagers imagers that image in multiple wavelengths CCD cameras photo detector arrays TFT imagers and so forth. It should also be understood that while polarized light has been used to create two different images other variations in the reflected light may also be used. For example rather than using polarized light white light may be used and then different filters applied to the imagers such as a Bayer filter a CYGM filter or an RGBE filter. In other embodiments it may be possible to dispense with a source of polarized light and instead use natural or white light rather than a source of polarized light.

The use of touchless or contactless fingerprinting has been under development for some time as evidenced by earlier systems. For example U.S. Pat. Appl. 2002 0106115 used polarized light in a non contact system but required a metallic coating on the fingers of the person being fingerprinted. Later systems such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 651 594 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2008 0219522 required contact with a platen or other surface. The contactless system described herein does not require contact at the time of imaging nor does it require prior contact e.g. placing a coating or a reflective coating on the body part of interest. Of course the positions of the imagers or cameras with respect to each other should be known for easier processing.

In use the contactless fingerprint system may be employed at a checkpoint such as a compound entrance a building entrance a roadside checkpoint or other convenient location. Such a location may be one where it is desirable to admit some persons and to refuse entrance or even detain other persons of interest. In practice the system may make use of an external light source such as a lamp if polarized light is used. The cameras or other imagers used for the contactless imaging may be mounted on opposite sides of one set of augmented reality glasses for one person . For example a two camera version is shown in with two cameras mounted on frame . In this embodiment the software for at least processing the image may be contained within a memory of the augmented reality glasses. Alternatively the digital data from the cameras imagers may be routed to a nearby datacenter for appropriate processing. This processing may include combining the digital data to form an image of the print. The processing may also include checking a database of known persons to determine whether the subject is of interest.

Alternatively one camera on each of two persons may be used as seen in the camera in . In this configuration the two persons would be relatively near so that their respective images would be suitably similar for combining by the appropriate software. For example the two cameras in may be mounted on two different pairs of augmented reality glasses such as on two soldiers manning a checkpoint. Alternatively the cameras may be mounted on a wall or on stationary parts of the checkpoint itself. The two images may then be combined by a remote processor with memory such as a computer system at the building checkpoint.

As discussed above persons using the augmented reality glasses may be in constant contact with each other through at least one of many wireless technologies especially if they are both on duty at a checkpoint. Accordingly the data from the single cameras or from the two camera version may be sent to a data center or other command post for the appropriate processing followed by checking the database for a match of the palm print fingerprint iris print and so forth. The data center may be conveniently located near the checkpoint. With the availability of modern computers and storage the cost of providing multiple datacenters and wirelessly updating the software will not be a major cost consideration in such systems.

The touchless or contactless biometric data gathering discussed above may be controlled in several ways such as the control techniques discussed else in this disclosure. For example in one embodiment a user may initiate a data gathering session by pressing a touch pad on the glasses or by giving a voice command. In another embodiment the user may initiate a session by a hand movement or gesture or using any of the control techniques described herein. Any of these techniques may bring up a menu from which the user may select an option such as begin data gathering session terminate data gathering session or continue session. If a data gathering session is selected the computer controlled menu may then offer menu choices for number of cameras which cameras and so forth much as a user selects a printer. There may also be modes such as a polarized light mode a color filter mode and so forth. After each selection the system may complete a task or offer another choice as appropriate. User intervention may also be required such as turning on a source of polarized light or other light source applying filters or polarizers and so forth.

After fingerprints palm prints iris images or other desired data has been acquired the menu may then offer selections as to which database to use for comparison which device s to use for storage etc. The touchless or contactless biometric data gathering system may be controlled by any of the methods described herein.

While the system and sensors have obvious uses in identifying potential persons of interest there are positive battlefield uses as well. The fingerprint sensor may be used to call up a soldier s medical history giving information immediately on allergies blood type and other time sensitive and treatment determining data quickly and easily thus allowing proper treatment to be provided under battlefield conditions. This is especially helpful for patients who may be unconscious when initially treated and who may be missing identification tags.

A further embodiment of a device for capturing biometric data from individuals may incorporate a server to store and process biometric data collected. The biometric data captured may include a hand image with multiple fingers a palm print a face camera image an iris image an audio sample of an individual s voice and a video of the individual s gait or movement. The collected data must be accessible to be useful.

Processing of the biometric data may be done locally or remotely at a separate server. Local processing may offer the option to capture raw images and audio and make the information available on demand from a computer host over a WiFi or USB link. As an alternative another local processing method processes the images and then transmits the processed data over the Internet. This local processing includes the steps of finding the finger prints rating the finger prints finding the face and then cropping it finding and then rating the iris and other similar steps for audio and video data. While processing the data locally requires more complex code it does offer the advantage of reduced data transmission over the Internet.

A scanner associated with the biometric data collection devices may use code that is compliant with the USB Image Device protocol that is a commonly used scanner standard. Other embodiments may use different scanner standards depending on need.

When a WiFi network is used to transfer the data the Bio Print device which is further described herein can function or appear like a web server to the network. Each of the various types of images may be available by selecting or clicking on a web page link or button from a browser client. This web server functionality may be part of the Bio Print device specifically included in the microcomputer functionality.

A web server may be a part of the Bio Print microcomputer host allowing for the Bio Print device to author a web page that exposes captured data and also provides some controls. An additional embodiment of the browser application could provide controls to capture high resolution hand prints face images iris images set the camera resolution set the capture time for audio samples and also enable a streaming connection using a web cam Skype or similar mechanism. This connection could be attached to the audio and face camera.

A further embodiment provides a browser application that gives access to images and audio captured via file transfer protocol FTP or other protocol. A still further embodiment of the browser application may provide for automatic refreshes at a selectable rate to repeatedly grab preview images.

An additional embodiment provides local processing of captured biometric data using a microcomputer and provides additional controls to display a rating of the captured image allowing a user to rate each of the prints found retrieve faces captured and also to retrieve cropped iris images and allow a user to rate each of the iris prints.

Yet another embodiment provides a USB port compatible with the Open Multimedia Application Platform OMAP3 system. OMAP3 is a proprietary system on a chip for portable multimedia applications. The OMAP3 device port is equipped with a Remote Network Driver Interface Specification RNDIS a proprietary protocol that may be used on top of USB. These systems provide the capability that when a Bio Print device is plugged into a Windows PC USB host port the device shows up as an IP interface. This IP interface would be the same as over WiFi TCP IP web server . This allows for moving data off the microcomputer host and provides for display of the captured print.

An application on the microcomputer may implement the above by receiving data from an FPGA over the USB bus. Once received JPEG content is created. This content may be written over a socket to a server running on a laptop or be written to a file. Alternately the server could receive the socket stream pop the image and leave it open in a window thus creating a new window for each biometric capture. If the microcomputer runs Network File System NFS a protocol for use with Sun based systems or SAMBA a free software reimplementation that provides file and print services for Windows clients the files captured may be shared and accessed by any client running NFS or System Management Bus SMB a PC communication bus implementation. In this embodiment a JPEG viewer would display the files. The display client could include a laptop augmented reality glasses or a phone running the Android platform.

An additional embodiment provides for a server side application offering the same services described above.

An alternative embodiment to a server side application displays the results on the augmented reality glasses.

A further embodiment provides the microcomputer on a removable platform similar to a mass storage device or streaming camera. The removable platform also incorporates an active USB serial port.

In embodiments the eyepiece may include audio and or visual sensors to capture sounds and or visuals from 360 degrees around the wearer of an eyepiece. This may be from sensors mounted on the eyepiece itself or coupled to sensors mounted on a vehicle that the wearer is in. For instance sound sensors and or cameras may be mounted to the outside of a vehicle where the sensors are communicatively coupled to the eyepiece to provide a surround sound and or sight view of the surrounding environment. In addition the sound system of the eyepiece may provide sound protection canceling augmentation and the like to help improve the hearing quality of the wearer while they are surrounded by extraneous or loud noise. In an example a wearer may be coupled to cameras mounted on the vehicle they are driving. These cameras may then be in communication with the eyepiece and provide a 360 degree view around the vehicle such as provided in a projected graphical image through the eyepiece display to the wearer.

In an example and referring to control aspects of the eyepiece may include a remote device in the form of a watch controller such as including a receiver and or transmitter for interfacing with the eyepiece for messaging and or controlling the eyepiece when the user is not wearing the eyepiece.

In embodiments feedback to the wearer related to external devices and applications may include visual display heads up display bulls eye or target tracking display tonal output or sound warning performance or rating indicator score mission accomplished indication action complete indication play of content display of information reports data mining recommendations targeted advertisements and the like.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a head nod from a soldier as movement to initiate a silent command such as during a combat engagement through a graphical user interface for reflecting modes and or interfaces in which the control input is reflected a military application on the eyepiece that uses the commands and or responds to the control input an audio system controller to communicate and or connect from the eyepiece interface to an external system or device and the like. For instance the soldier may be controlling a secure communications device through the eyepiece during a combat engagement and wish to change some aspect of communications such as a channel a frequency an encoding level and the like without making a sound and with minimal motion so as to minimize the chance of being heard or seen. In this instance a nod of the soldier s head may be programmed to indicate the change such as a quick nod forward to indicate the beginning of a transmission a quick nod backward to indicate the end of a transmission and the like. In addition the eyepiece may be projecting a graphical user interface to the soldier for the secure communications device such as showing what channel is active what alternative channels are available others in their team that are currently transmitting and the like. The nod of the soldier may then be interpreted by processing facilities of the eyepiece as a change command the command transmitted to the audio system controller and the graphical user interface for the communications device showing the change. Further certain nods body motions may be interpreted as specific commands to be transmitted such that the eyepiece sends a pre established communication without the soldier needing to be audible. That is the soldier may be able to send pre canned communications to their team though body motions for example as determined together with the team prior to the engagement . In this way a soldier wearing and utilizing the facilities of the eyepiece may be able to connect and interface with the external secure communications device in a completely stealthy manner maintaining silent communications with their team during engagement even when out of sight with the team. In embodiments other movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected applications on platform that can use commands and or respond to inputs communication or connection from the on platform interface to external systems and devices and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of motion and position sensors as sensing inputs an augmented reality interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected to a soldier a motion sensor and range finder for a weapon system as external devices to be controlled and information collected from feedback to the soldier related to the external devices and the like. For instance a soldier wearing the eyepiece may be monitoring military movements within an environment with the motion sensor and when the motion sensor is triggered an augmented reality interface may be projected to the wearer that helps identify a target such as a person vehicle and the like for further monitoring and or targeting. In addition the range finder may be able to determine the range to the object and feedback that information to the soldier for use in targeting such as manually with the soldier executing a firing action or automatically with the weapon system receiving the information for targeting and the soldier providing a command to fire . In embodiments the augmented reality interface may provide information to the soldier about the target such as the location of the object on a 2D or 3D projected map identity of the target from previously collected information e.g. as stored in an object database including face recognition object recognition coordinates of the target night vision imaging of the target and the like. In embodiments the triggering of the motion detector may be interpreted by processing facilities of the eyepiece as a warning event the command may be transmitted to the range finder to determine the location of the object as well as to the speakers of the ear phones of the eyepiece to provide an audio warning to the soldier that a moving object has been sensed in the area being monitored. The audio warning plus visual indicators to the soldier may serve as inputs to the soldier that attention should be paid to the moving object such as if the object has been identified as an object of interest to the soldier such as through an accessed database for known combatants known vehicle types and the like. For instance the soldier may be at a guard post monitoring the perimeter around the post at night. In this case the environment may be dark and the soldier may have fallen into a low attentive state as it may be late at night with all environmental conditions quiet. The eyepiece may then act as a sentry augmentation device watching from the soldier s personal perspective as opposed to some external monitoring facility for the guard post . When the eyepiece senses movement the soldier may be instantly alerted as well as guided to the location range identity and the like of the motion. In this way the soldier may be able to react to avoid personal danger to target fire to the located movement and the like as well as alert the post to potential danger. Further if a firelight were to ensue the soldier may have improved reaction time as a result of the warning from the eyepiece with better decision making though information about the target and minimizing the danger of being injured or the guard post from being infiltrated. In embodiments other sensing inputs and or sensing devices command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected useful external devices to be controlled feedback related to external devices and or external applications and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In embodiments the eyepiece may enable remote control of vehicles such as a truck robot drone helicopter watercraft and the like. For instance a soldier wearing the eyepiece may be able to command through an internal communications interface for control of the vehicle. Vehicle control may be provided through voice commands body movement e.g. a soldier instrumented with movement sensors that are in interactive communication with the eyepiece and interfaced through the eyepiece to control the vehicle keyboard interface and the like. In an example a soldier wearing an eyepiece may provide remote control to a bomb disposal robot or vehicle where commands are generated by the soldier though a command interface of the eyepiece such as described herein. In another example a soldier may command an aircraft such as a remote control drone remote control tactical counter rotating helicopter and the like. Again the soldier may provide control of the remote control aircraft through control interfaces as described herein.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a wearable sensor set as an action capture input for a soldier utilizing a robot control interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected a drone or other robotic device as an external device to be controlled and the like. For instance the soldier wearing the eyepiece may be instrumented with a sensor set for the control of a military drone such as with motion sensor inputs to control motion of the drone hand recognition control for manipulation of control features of the drone e.g. such as through a graphical user interface displayed through the eyepiece voice command inputs for control of the drone and the like. In embodiments control of the drone through the eyepiece may include control of flight control of on board interrogation sensors e.g. visible camera IR camera radar threat avoidance and the like. The soldier may be able to guide the drone to its intended target using body mounted sensors and picturing the actual battlefield through a virtual 2D 3D projected image where flight camera monitoring controls are commanded though body motions of the soldier. In this way the soldier may be able to maintain an individualistic full visual immersion of the flight and environment of the drone for greater intuitive control. The eyepiece may have a robot control interface for managing and reconciling the various control inputs from the soldier worn sensor set and for providing an interface for control of the drone. The drone may then be controlled remotely through physical action of the soldier such as through a wireless connection to a military control center for drone control and management. In another similar example a soldier may control a bomb disarming robot that may be controlled through a soldier worn sensor set and associated eyepiece robot control interface. For instance the soldier may be provided with a graphical user interface that provides a 2D or 3D view of the environment around the bomb disarming robot and where the sensor pack provides translation of the motion of the soldier e.g. arms hands and the like to motions of the robot. In this way the soldier may be able to provide a remote control interface to the robot to better enable sensitive control during the delicate bomb disarming process. In embodiments other user action capture inputs and or devices command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected useful external devices to be controlled and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of an event indication to the soldier as they enter a location a predictive learning based user interface as a command and control mode and or interface in which the input occurrence of the event is reflected a weapons control system as an external device to be controlled and the like. For instance an eyepiece may be programmed to learn the behavior of a soldier such as what the soldier typically does when they enter a particular environment with a particular weapons control system e.g. does the wearer turn on the system arm the system bring up visual displays for the system and the like. From this learned behavior the eyepiece may be able to make a prediction of what the soldier wants in the way of an eyepiece control function. For example the soldier may be thrust into a combat situation and needs the immediate use of a weapons control system. In this case the eyepiece may sense the location and or the identity of the weapons system as the soldier approaches and configure enable the weapons system to how the soldier typically configures the system when they are near the weapons control system such as in previous uses of the weapons system where the eyepiece was in a learning mode and commanding the weapons control system to turn on the system as last configured. In embodiments the eyepiece may sense the location and or identity of the weapons system through a plurality of methods and systems such as through a vision system recognizing the location an RFID system a GPS system and the like. In embodiments the commanding of the weapons control system may be through a graphical user interface that provides the soldier with a visual for fire control of the weapon system an audio voice command system interface that provides choices to the soldier and voice recognition for commanding pre determined automatic activation of a function and the like. In embodiments there may be a profile associated with such learned commanding where the soldier is able to modify the learned profile and or set preferences within the learned profile to help optimize automated actions and the like. For example the soldier may have separate weapon control profiles for weapons readiness i.e. while on post and awaiting action and for active weapons engagement with the enemy. The soldier may need to modify a profile to adjust to changing conditions associated with use of the weapon system such as a change in fire command protocols ammunition type added capabilities of the weapon system and the like. In embodiments other events and or data feeds command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected useful external devices to be controlled and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of an individual responsibility event for a soldier such as deployed in a theater of action and managing their time as an event and or data feed a voice recognition system as a user action capture input device an auditory command interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected video based communications as an application on the eyepiece that is used to respond to the input from the soldier and the like. For instance a soldier wearing the eyepiece may get a visual indication projected to them of a scheduled event for a group video supported communication between commanders. The soldier may then use a voice command to an auditory command interface on the eyepiece to bring up the contact information for the call and voice command the group video communication to be initiated. In this way the eyepiece may serve as a personal assistant for the soldier bringing up scheduled events and providing the soldier with a hands free command interface to execute the scheduled events. In addition the eyepiece may provide for the visual interface for the group video communication where the images of the other commanders are projected to the soldier through the eyepiece and where an external camera is providing the soldier s video image through communicative connection to the eyepiece such as with an external device with a camera using a mirror with the internally integrated camera and the like as described herein . In this way the eyepiece may provide a fully integrated personal assistant and phone video based communications platform subsuming the functions of other traditionally separate electronics devices such as the radio mobile phone a video phone a personal computer a calendar a hands free command and control interface and the like. In embodiments other events and or data feeds user action capture inputs and or devices command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected applications on platform that can use commands and or respond to inputs and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a security event to a soldier as an event and or data feed a camera and touch screen as user action capture input devices an information processing fingerprint capture facial recognition application on the eyepiece to respond to the inputs a graphical user interface for communications and or connection between the eyepiece and external systems and devices and an external information processing fingerprint capture facial recognition application and database for access to external security facilities and connectivity and the like. For instance a soldier may receive a security event while on post at a military checkpoint where a plurality of individuals is to be security checked and or identified. In this case there may be a need for recording the biometrics of the individuals such as because they don t show up in a security database because of suspicious behavior because they fit the profile of a member of a combatant and the like. The soldier may then use biometric input devices such as a camera for photographing faces and a touch screen for recording fingerprints where the biometric inputs are managed though an internal information processing fingerprint capture and facial recognition application on the eyepiece. In addition the eyepiece may provide a graphical user interface as a communications connection to an external information processing fingerprint capture and facial recognition application where the graphical user interface provides data capture interfaces external database access people of interest database and the like. The eyepiece may provide for an end to end security management facility including monitoring for people of interest input devices for taking biometric data displaying inputs and database information connectivity to external security and database applications and the like. For instance the soldier may be checking people through a military checkpoint and the soldier has been commanded to collect facial images such as with iris biometrics for anyone that meets a profile and is not currently in a security database. As individuals approach the soldier as in a line to pass through the checkpoint the soldier s eyepiece takes high resolution images of each individual for facial and or iris recognition such as checked though a database accessible though a network communication link. A person may be allowed to pass the checkpoint if they do not meet the profile e.g. a young child or is in the database with an indication that they are not considered a threat. A person may not be allowed to pass through the checkpoint and is pulled aside if the individual is indicated to be a threat or meets the profile and is not in the database. If they need to be entered into the security database the soldier may be able to process the individual directly through facilities of the eyepiece or with the eyepiece controlling an external device such as for collecting personal information for the individual taking a close up image of the individual s face and or iris recording fingerprints and the like such as described herein. In embodiments other events and or data feeds user action capture inputs and or devices applications on platform that can use commands and or respond to inputs communication or connection from the on platform interface to external systems and devices applications for external devices and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a finger movement as a user action for a soldier initiating an eyepiece command a clickable icon as a command and control mode and or interface in which the user action can be reflected an application on the eyepiece e.g. weapons control troop movements intelligence data feed and the like a military application tracking API as a communication and or connection from the eyepiece application to an external system an external personnel tracking application feedback to military personnel and the like. For instance a system for monitoring a soldier s selection of an on eyepiece application may be implemented through an API such that the monitoring provides a service to the military for monitoring and tracking application usage feedback to the soldier as to other applications available to them based on the monitored behavior and the like. In the course of a day the soldier may select an application for use and or download such as through a graphical user interface where clickable icons are presented and to which the soldier may be able to select the icon based on a finger movement control implementation facility such as a camera or inertial system through which the soldier s finger action is used as a control input in this case to select the clickable icon . The selection may then be monitored through the military application tracking API that sends the selection or stored number of selections such as transmitting stored selections over a period of time to the external personnel tracking application. The soldier s application selections in this case virtual clicks may then be analyzed for the purpose of optimizing usage such as through increasing bandwidth change of available applications improvement to existing applications and the like. Further the external personnel tracking application may utilize the analysis to determine what the wearer s preferences are in terms of applications use and send the wearer feedback in the form of recommendations of applications the wearer may be interested in a preference profile a list of what other similar military users are utilizing and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may provide services to improve the soldier s experience with the eyepiece such as with recommendations for usage that the soldier may benefit from and the like while aiding in guiding the military use of the eyepiece and applications thereof. For instance a soldier that is new to using the eyepiece may not fully utilize its capabilities such as in use of augmented reality interfaces organizational applications mission support and the like. The eyepiece may have the capability to monitor the soldier s utilization compare the utilization to utilization metrics such as stored in an external eyepiece utilization facility and provide feedback to the soldier in order to improve use and associated efficiency of the eyepiece and the like. In embodiments other user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected applications on platform that can use commands and or respond to inputs communication or connection from the on platform interface to external systems and devices applications for external devices feedback related to external devices and or external applications and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of body movement e.g. kinetic sensor and touch sensors as user action capture sensing devices head and hand movement as user actions for controlling and or initiating commands a virtual reality interface as a command and control interface through which the inputs can be reflected an information display as an application on the eyepiece that can respond to the inputs a combat simulator as an external device to be controlled through a combat simulation application and the activation of the combat simulator content to the soldier with performance rating score and the like as feedback to the user related to the external device and application. For instance a soldier may be able to interact with an artificial reality enhanced combat simulator where the wearer s body movements are interpreted as control inputs such as though body movement sensors touch sensors and the like. In this way movements of the wearer s body may be fed into the combat simulator rather than using more traditional control inputs such as a handheld controller. Thus the soldier s experience may be more realistic such as to provide better muscle memory from the simulated combat exercise such as when engaged in defensive avoidance in a firelight and the like and where the eyepiece provides a full immersion experience for the soldier without the need for external devices that would normally not be used by the soldier in a live action. Body motion control inputs may feed into a virtual reality interface and information display application on the eyepiece to provide the user with the visual depiction of the simulated combat environment. In embodiments the combat simulator may be run entirely on board the eyepiece as a local application interfaced to an external combat simulator facility local to the wearer interfaced to a networked combat simulator facility e.g. a massively multiplayer combat simulator an individual combat simulator a group combat simulator through a local network connection and the like. In the case where the eyepiece is interfacing and controlling a hybrid local external combat simulator environment the eyepiece application portion of simulation execution may provide the visual environment and information display to the soldier and the external combat simulator facility may provide the combat simulator application execution. It would be clear to one skilled in the art that many different partitioning configurations between the processing provided by the eyepiece and processing provided by external facilities may be implemented. Further the combat simulator implementation may extend to external facilities across a secure network. External facilities whether local or across the secure network may then provide feedback to the soldier such as in providing at least a portion of the executed content e.g. the locally provided projection combined with content from the external facilities and other soldiers performance indications scores rankings and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may provide a soldier environment where the eyepiece interfaces with external control inputs and external processing facilities to create the next generation of combat simulator platform. In embodiments other sensing inputs and or sensing devices user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected applications on platform that can use commands and or respond to inputs useful external devices to be controlled feedback related to external devices and or external applications and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of IR thermal force carbon monoxide and the like sensors as inputs microphone as an additional input device voice commands as an action by a soldier to initiate commands a heads up display as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected an instructional guidance application to provide guidance while reducing the need for the soldier to use their hands such as in emergency repair in the field maintenance assembly and the like a visual display that provides feedback to the soldier based on the actions of the soldier and the sensor inputs and the like. For instance a soldier s vehicle may have been damaged in a firefight leaving the soldier s stranded without immediate transport capabilities. The soldier may be able to bring up an instructional guidance application as running through the eyepiece to provide hands free instruction and computer based expert knowledge access to diagnosing the problem with the vehicle. In addition the application may provide a tutorial for procedures not familiar to the soldier such as restoring basic and temporary functionality of the vehicle. The eyepiece may also be monitoring various sensor inputs relevant to the diagnosis such as an IR thermal force ozone carbon monoxide and the like sensors so that the sensor input may be accessible to the instructional application and or directly accessible to the soldier. The application may also provide for a microphone through which voice commands may be accepted a heads up display for the display of instruction information 2D or 3D depiction of the portion of the vehicle under repair and the like. In embodiments the eyepiece may be able to provide a hands free virtual assistant to the soldier to assist them in the diagnosis and repair of the vehicle in order to re establish a means for transport allowing the soldier to re engage the enemy or move to safety. In embodiments other sensing inputs and or sensing devices user action capture inputs and or devices user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands command and or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected applications on platform that can use commands and or respond to inputs feedback related to external devices and or external applications and the like as described herein may also be applied.

In an example control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of the eyepiece entering an activity state such as a military engagement activity mode e.g. the soldier commanding the eyepiece into a military engagement mode or the eyepiece sensing it is in proximity to a military activity perhaps even a predetermined or targeted engagement area through a received mission directive which may have further been developed in part through self monitoring and learning the wearer s general engagement assignment. Continuing with this example entering an activity state e.g. a military engagement activity state such as while driving in a vehicle into an encounter with the enemy or into hostile territory may be combined with an object detector as a sensing input or sensing device a head mounted camera and or eye gaze detection system as a user action capture input eye movement as a user movement or action for controlling or initiating commands a 3D navigation interface as a command and control mode and or interface in which the inputs can be reflected an engagement management application on board the eyepiece as an application for coordinating command inputs and user interface a navigation system controller to communicate or connect with external systems or devices a vehicle navigation system as an external device to be controlled and or interfaced with a military planning and execution facility as an external application for processing user actions with regard to a military directive bulls eye or target tracking system as feedback to the wearer as to enemy targeting opportunities within sight while driving and the like. For instance a soldier may enter a hostile environment while driving their vehicle and the eyepiece detecting the presence of the enemy engagement area e.g. through GPS direct viewing targets through an integrated camera and the like may enter a military engagement activity state such as enabled and or approved by the soldier . The eyepiece may then detect an enemy vehicle hostile dwelling and the like with an object detector that locates an enemy targeting opportunity such as through a head mounted camera. Further an eye gaze detection system on the eyepiece may monitor where the soldier is looking and possibly highlight information about a target at the location of the wearer s gaze such as enemy personnel enemy vehicle enemy weapons as well as friendly forces where friend and foe are identified and differentiated. The soldier s eye movement may also be tracked such as for changing targets of interest or for command inputs e.g. a quick nod indicating a selection command a downward eye movement indicating a command for additional information and the like . The eyepiece may invoke a 3D navigation interface projection to assist in providing the soldier with information associated with their surroundings and a military engagement application for coordinating the military engagement activity state such as taking inputs from the soldier providing outputs to the 3D navigation interface interfacing with external devices and applications and the like. The eyepiece may for instance utilize a navigation system controller to interface with a vehicle navigation system and thus may include the vehicle navigation system into the military engagement experience.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide a user with various forms of guidance in responding to medical situations. As a first example the user may use the eyepiece for training purposes to simulate medical situations that may arise in combat training on or off duty and the like. The simulation may be geared towards a medical professional or non medical personnel.

By way of example a low level combat soldier may use the eyepiece to view a medical simulation as part of a training module to provide training for response to medical situations on the battlefield. The eyepiece may provide an augmented environment where the user views injuries overlaid on another solider to simulate those common or capable of being found on the battlefield. The soldier may then be prompted through a user interface to respond to the situation as presented. The user may be given step by step instructions of a course of action in providing emergency medical care on the field or the user may carry out actions in response to the situation that are then corrected until the appropriate response is given.

Similarly the eyepiece may provide a training environment for a medical professional. The eyepiece may present the user with a medical emergency or situation requiring a medical response for the purpose of training the medical professional. The eyepiece may play out common battle field scenarios for which the user must master appropriate responses and lifesaving techniques.

By way of example the user may be presented with an augmented reality of a wounded soldier with a gunshot wound to the soldier s body. The medical professional may then act out the steps he feels to be the appropriate response for the situation select steps through a user interface of the eyepiece that he feels are appropriate for the situation input the steps into a user interface of the eyepiece and the like. The user may act out the response through use of sensors and or an input device or he may input the steps of his response into a user interface via eye movements hand gestures and the like. Similarly he may select the appropriate steps as presented to him through the user interface via eye movements hand gestures and the like. As actions are carried out and the user makes decisions about treatment the user may be presented with additional guidance and instruction based on his performance. For example if the user is presented with a soldier with a gunshot wound to the chest and the user begins to lift the soldier to a dangerous position the user may be given a warning or prompt to change his course of treatment. Alternatively the user may be prompted with the correct steps in order to practice proper procedure. Further the trainee may be presented with an example of a medical chart for the wounded soldier in the training situation where the user may have to base his decisions at least in part on what is contained in the medical chart. In various embodiments the user s actions and performance may be recorded and or documented by the eyepiece for further critiquing and instruction after the training session has paused or otherwise stopped.

In embodiments the eyepiece may provide a user with various forms of guidance in responding to actual medical situations in combat. By way of example a non trained soldier may be prompted with step by step life saving instructions for fellow soldiers in medical emergencies when a medic is not immediately present. When a fellow soldier is wounded the user may input the type of injury the eyepiece may detect the injury or a combination of these may occur. From there the user may be provided with life saving instruction with which to treat the wounded soldier. Such instruction may be presented in the form of augmented reality in a step wise process of instructions for the user. Further the eyepiece may provide augmented visual aids to the user regarding location of vital organs near the wounded soldier s injury an anatomical overlay of the soldier s body and the like. Further the eyepiece may take video of the situation that is then sent back to a medic not in the field or on his way to the field thereby allowing the medic to walk the untrained user through an appropriate lifesaving technique on the battlefield. Further the wounded soldier s eyepiece may send vital information such as information collected through integral or associated sensors about the wounded soldier to the treating soldier s eyepiece to be sent to the medic or it may be sent directly to the medic in a remote location such that the treating soldier may provide the wounded solider with medical help based on the information gathered from the wounded soldier s eyepiece.

In other embodiments when presented with a medical emergency on the battlefield a trained medic may use the eyepiece to provide an anatomical overlay of the soldier s body so that he may respond more appropriately to the situation at hand. By way of example only and not to limit the present invention if the wounded soldier is bleeding from a gunshot wound to the leg the user may be presented with an augmented reality view of the soldier s arteries such that the user may determine whether an artery has been hit and how severe the wound may be. The user may be presented with the proper protocol via the eyepiece for the given wound so that he may check each step as he moves through treatment. Such protocol may also be presented to the user in an augmented reality video audio or other format. The eyepiece may provide the medic with protocols in the form of augmented reality instructions in a step wise process. In embodiments the user may also be presented with an augmented reality overlay of the wounded soldier s organs in order to guide the medic through any procedure such that the medic does not do additional harm to the soldier s organs during treatment. Further the eyepiece may provide augmented visual aids to the user regarding location of vital organs near the wounded soldier s injury an anatomical overlay of the soldier s body and the like.

In embodiments the eyepiece may be used to scan the retina of the wounded soldier in order to pull up his medical chart on the battlefield. This may alert the medic to possible allergies to medication or other important issues that may provide a benefit during medical treatment.

Further if the wounded soldier is wearing the eyepiece the device may send information to the medic s glasses including the wounded soldier s heart rate blood pressure breathing stress and the like. The eyepiece may also help the user observe the walking gait of a soldier to determine if the soldier has a head injury and they may help the user determine the location of bleeding or an injury.

In embodiments the augmented reality eyepiece AR of the present invention e.g. AR eyepiece in is adapted to determine and or compensate for the vergence of the user s eyes. Vergence is the simultaneous rotation of the user s eyes around a vertical axis to move their respective optical axes in opposite directions to obtain or maintain binocular vision. When a person looks at a closer object the person s eyes move their respective optical axes inwardly toward the nose a composite motion that is known as convergence. To look at a farther object the person s eyes move their respective optical axes outwardly away from the nose a composite motion that is known as divergence. The person s eyes diverge until their respective optical axes are essentially parallel to each other when the person is fixating on a point at infinity or very far away. Vergence works in conjunction with eye accommodation to permit a person to maintain a clear image of an object as the object moves relative to the person. Vergence compensation becomes important in situations where a virtual image i.e. an AR image such as a label or other information is to be placed near to or overlap a real image or when a virtual image of an object is to be superimposed upon a real image of the object in order to make the placement of the virtual image correct with respect to the real image. Methods of the present invention for vergence compensation and or determination are described in the following paragraphs 00829 through 00850 and are collectively referred to as vergence methods.

The vergence methods may include a determination of the distance an object of interest from the user of the AR eyepiece and subsequent use of that distance to determine the vergence angle i.e the angle formed by the intersection of the optical axes of the user s eyes as they look at the object. The vergence angle is then used to determine the correct placement of the AR image with respect to the object which may be in front of behind or at the matched to the object. For example in a first set of vergence method embodiments a single autofocus digital camera having a output signal is mounted in the AR eyepiece at some convenient location e.g. in the bridge section or near one of the temples. The output of the camera is provided to a microprocessor within the AR eyepiece and or transmitted to a remote processor. In either case its signals relating to its autofocus capabilities are used to determine the distance to objects which the user may see when the user is looking straight ahead. This distance along with the interpupilary distance of the user s eyes is to determine the vergence and the correct placement of a virtual image e.g. a label which may be desired for those objects. The distance and or the vergence angle may also be used to determine the level of focus of the virtual object is to have to be properly observable by the user. Optionally additional information about that particular user s vergence characteristics may be input and stored in memory associated with the microprocessor and used to adjust the determination of the vergence.

In a second set of vergence method embodiments an electronic range finder that is independent of a camera is incorporated into the AR eyepiece at some convenient location e.g. in the bridge section or near one of the temples. In these embodiments the output of the electronic range finder is used in the same manner as was the output of the autofocus camera described with regard to the first set of vergence method embodiments.

In a third set of vergence method embodiments the AR eyepiece includes a plurality of range finding devices which may be autofocus cameras and or electronic range finders. All of the plurality of devices may be aligned so as to determine the distance of objects in the same direction or one or more of the devices may be aligned differently from the other devices so that information about the distance to a variety of objects is obtainable. The outputs from one or more of the devices are input and analyzed in the same manner as was the output of the autofocus camera described with regard to the first set of vergence methods.

In a fourth set of vergence method embodiments one or more range finding devices are employed in the manner discussed above. Additionally the AR eyepiece includes one or more eye tracking devices which are configured to track the movement and or viewing direction of one or both of the user s eyes. The output of the eye tracking devices is provided to a microprocessor within the AR eyepiece or may be transmitted to a remote processor. This output is used to determine the direction the user is viewing and when eye tracking information from both eyes is available to determine the vergence of the user s eyes. This direction and if available vergence information is then used alone or in conjunction with the vergence information determined from the range finding devices to determine placement and optionally the level of focus of one or more virtual images related to one or more objects which the user may be viewing.

In a fifth set of vergence methods one or more range finding device is directed away from the direction that is straight ahead of the user of the AR eyepiece. Distances to objects detected by the range finder device are used to display virtual images of the object in the manner described above. Although the user may or may not be aware of the virtual images when he is looking straight ahead the user will be aware of the virtual images when the user looks in the direction of the objects to which they are related.

A calibration sequence may be used with any of the vergence method embodiments. The calibration sequence may employ steps of mechanical calibration nature of an electronic calibration nature or both. During the calibration sequence the interpupilarly distance of the user may be determined. Also the user may be requested to look at a series of real or virtual objects having range of real or virtual distances e.g. from near to far and the vergence of the eyes is measured either mechanically or electronically or both. The information from this calibration sequence may then be employed in the determinations of vergence focusing and or virtual image placement when the AR eyepieces are in use. The calibration sequence is preferably employed when a user first puts on the AR eyepiece but may be employed anytime the user believes that a recalibration would be helpful. Information correlating the user to that obtained during a calibration sequence may be stored for use whenever that particular user identifies himself to the AR eyepiece as its user e.g. using any of the techniques described in this document.

It is to be noted that some range finding devices use range determining methodologies in which information received from a device s sensors is mapped upon a space representing rectilinear or non rectilinear grid. The information from the various sectors of the grid is inter compared to determine the range distance. In the vergence method embodiments the raw sensor information the mapping information the calculated distance or any combination of these may be used in the determination of the placement and or focus of the virtual image or images.

It is to be understood that the vergence method embodiments include the placement of a virtual image for one of the user s eyes or for both of the user s eyes. In some embodiments one virtual image is provided to the user s left eye and a different virtual image is provided to the user s right eye. In cases where multiple images are placed before the user whether or not the images are the same or different the placement may be simultaneous at different times or interlaced in time e.g. the images are shown at a predetermined flicker rate or rates e.g. 30 60 and or 180 Hz with the image for the left eye being present when the image for the right eye is not and vice versa. In some embodiments a virtual image is shown only to the person s dominant eye and in others a virtual image is shown only to the person s non dominant eye. In some embodiments which employ images which are interlaced in time virtual images of various objects which are located at various distances from the user are displayed in the manner described above when the user looks from the real image of one object to the real image of another object only the virtual image corresponding to the real image of the object being viewed will be seen by the user s brain.

In embodiments the invention provides methods for providing a depth cue with augmented reality virtual objects or virtual information that can convey a wide range of perceived depth to a broad range of individuals with different eye characteristics. These depth cue method embodiments of the present invention use differences in the lateral positioning or disparity of the augmented reality images provided to the two eyes of the individual to provide differences in the vergence of the virtual objects or virtual information that convey a sense of depth. One advantage of these methods is that the lateral shifting of the augmented reality images can be different for different portions of the augmented reality images so that the perceived depth is different for those portions. In addition the lateral shifting can be done through image processing of the portions of the augmented reality images. The user can experience a full range of perceived depth through this method from as near as the individual can focus to infinity regardless of the individual s age.

In order to better understand these depth cue method embodiments of the present invention it is useful to keep in mind that in some aspects of augmented reality head mounted displays are used to add images of virtual objects or virtual information that are associated with the view of a scene as seen by a user. To add additional effects to the perception of the augmented it is useful to place the virtual objects or virtual information at a perceived depth in the scene. As an example a virtual label can be placed onto an object in a scene such as the name of a building. The perceived association of the virtual label with the building is enhanced if the label and the building are perceived by the user to be at the same depth in the scene. Head mounted displays with see through capabilities are well suited to providing augmented reality information such as labels and objects because they provide the user with a clear view of the environment. However for the augmented reality information to be of value it must be easily associated with the objects in the environment and as such the positioning of the augmented reality information relative to the objects in the see through view is important. While horizontal and vertical positioning of augmented reality information is relatively straight forward if the head mounted display has a camera that can be calibrated to the see through view the depth positioning is more complicated. U.S. Pat. No. 6 690 393 describes a method for positioning 2D labels in a 3D virtual world. However this method is not directed at displays with a see through view where the majority of the image the user sees is not provided digitally and as such the 3D location of objects is not known. U.S. Pat. No. 7 907 166 describes a robotic surgical system using a stereo viewer in which telestration graphics are overlaid onto stereo images of an operating site. However similar to the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 690 393 this system uses captured images which are then manipulated to add graphics and as such does not address the unique situation with see through displays wherein the majority of the image is not provided digitally and the relative locations of objects that the user sees are not known. Another prior art method for augmented reality is to adjust the focus of the virtual objects or virtual information so that the user perceives differences in focus depth that provide a depth cue to the user. As the user has to refocus his her eyes to look at objects in the scene and to look at the virtual objects or virtual information the user perceives an associated depth. However the range of depth that can be associated with focus is limited by the accommodation that the user s eyes are capable of. This accommodation can be limited in some individuals particularly if the individual is older when eyes lose much of their accommodation range. In addition the accommodation range is different depending on whether the user is near sighted or far sighted. These factors make the result of using focus cues unreliable for a large population of user s with different ages and different eye characteristics. Therefore the need persists beyond what is available in the prior art for a widely useable method for associating depth information with augmented reality.

Some of the depth cue method embodiments of the present invention are described in this and the following paragraphs 0XXX through 0XYZ . Head mounted displays with see through capabilities provide a clear view of the scene in front of the user while also providing the ability to display an image where the user sees a combined image comprised of the see through view with the display image overlaid. The methods are entail the displaying of 3D labels and other 3D information using the see through display to aid the user in interpreting the environment surrounding the user. A stereo pair of images of the 3D labels and other 3D information may be presented to the left and right eyes of the user to position the 3D labels and other 3D information at different depths in the scene as perceived by the user. In this way the 3D labels and other 3D information can be more easily associated with the see through view and the surrounding environment.

To make it easier to associate labels or other information with the desired objects or aspects of the environment it is advantageous to present the labels or other information as three dimensional 3D labels or other 3D information so that the information is perceived by the user to be at different depths. This may be done by presenting 3D labels or other 3D information in overlaid images to the two eyes of the user with a lateral shift in position between the images that are overlaid onto the see through image so that the overlaid images have a perceived depth. This lateral shifting between images is also known as disparity to those skilled in stereo imaging and it causes the user to change the relative pointing of his her eyes to align the images visually and this induces a perception of depth. The images with disparity are images of the 3D labels or other 3D information that are overlaid onto the see through view of the scene seen by the user. By providing 3D labels with a large disparity the user must align the optical axes of his her eyes somewhat to bring the labels in the stereo images into alignment which gives a perception of the labels being located close to the user. The 3D labels that have a small disparity or no disparity can be visually aligned with the user s eyes looking straight ahead and this gives the perception of the 3D labels being located at a distance.

For example for 7 mm focal length cameras which are separated by 120 mm and used in conjunctions with image sensors having center to center pixel distances of 2.2 micron the disparities expressed in number of pixels a visual target point is shifted when one display is compared to the other are given Table 1 for some representative distances given in meters .

It is noted that sometimes in the art the disparity values for stereo images are described using numbers which range from negative to positive wherein zero disparity is defined for an object at a selected distance from the observer which the observer would perceive as being in the mid ground. The above recited equations must be adapted to account for this shift of the zero point. When disparity values are described in this way the disparities of a close object and a far object may be the same in magnitude and but opposite in sign.

While the present disclosure includes many embodiments shown and described in detail various modifications and improvements thereon will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly the spirit and scope of the present invention is not to be limited by the foregoing examples but is to be understood in the broadest sense allowable by law.
