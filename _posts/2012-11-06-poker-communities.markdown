The present invention relates to methods for improving social interactions in online games and more particularly methods computer programs and systems for providing play areas to online communities.

Online games that allow players to interact with other players have become popular. Some online games such as online poker fantasy games online chess etc. may have millions of players playing the game simultaneously although the players may be organized in groups that play in playing areas e.g. a poker table that host a limited number of players at a time. Online game operators also referred to as social game operators harness the power of online social networks to design games that allow players to interact with their friends within the games.

In some online poker games users can play with their friends by going to an online poker game and selecting to play in the same table as one or more friends. However there is no way to restrict the players that may access the poker table. This means that online poker players may have to play with any type of poker player at all times.

Methods devices systems and computer programs are presented for providing play areas to player communities. It should be appreciated that the present embodiments can be implemented in numerous ways such as a method an apparatus a system a device or a computer program on a computer readable medium. Several embodiments are described below.

In one embodiment a method includes an operation for identifying attributes of players in the online game. A characteristic that is common to a subset of players is determined in the online game where the characteristic is based on the attributes of players in the online game. The method further includes an operation for creating a playing area in the online game such that the subset of players are allowed to play in the playing area but players in the online game that are outside the subset of players are disallowed from playing in the playing area. The subset of players is then enabled to play in the playing area with other players from the subset of players.

In another embodiment a method includes an operation for determining a first subset of players in the game that have a common first characteristic the first common characteristic being based on attributes of players in the game. In addition the method includes an operation for determining a second subset of players in the game that have a common second characteristic. A playing area is created in the game where a first team integrated by members of the first subset of players competes against a second team integrated by members of the second subset of players. The first team and the second team are enabled to compete in the playing area.

In yet another embodiment a method includes an operation for identifying attributes of players in an online poker game and another operation for determining a characteristic that is common to a subset of players in the online poker game the characteristic being based on the attributes of players in the online poker game. A first poker table is created where the subset of players is allowed to play in the first poker table but players in the game outside the subset of players are disallowed from playing in the first poker table. The subset of players is then enabled to play in the first poker table.

Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The following embodiments describe methods systems and computer programs for providing playing areas to communities of players in an online game. It will be apparent that the present embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present embodiments.

In one embodiment the poker game is played with virtual chips which may be purchased with real cash and may be won or lost while playing the online poker game. The virtual chips may also be utilized to buy items in the online game area. Menu area gives the player options to buy items in the gift shop buy chips with legal currency manage the player s profile etc. In addition the player may buy a second type of virtual currency to buy items in the game or gain access to special features.

Webpage shows the lobby of a poker game which includes several options for the player. From the lobby the player is able to select a poker table to play poker with other players. Player status area provides information about the player such as the amount of chips available for playing the casino that the player is in etc. Additional information may also be found in the top information bar such as level achieved by the player.

The poker table selection area provides the user options to select a poker table. The poker table selection area includes options for playing Texas Hold Them poker playing in a tournament playing in a VIP table reserved for special players e.g. players with a minimum number of poker chips and playing in a community table. In the poker table selection area the tab for playing Texas Hold Them poker is selected and a list of poker tables is provided. Each poker table includes a name the betting stakes minimum and maximum buy in to sit down at the table and the number of players sitting at the table together with the maximum number of players for the table e.g. 4 5 which means that 4 players are playing poker in a poker table that holds a maximum of 5 players . In addition option button enables the player to select tables that play at a first speed e.g. Normal or tables that play at a second speed e.g. Fast .

An option to let the game select a table for the player is also provided in webpage . In addition a friend board lists friends of the player that are currently playing poker. The friends of the player may be friends from the social network or friends from within the game network. If the player selects one of the people listed in friend board the player will be taken to the same poker table where the friend is currently playing. In addition webpage may include other areas with additional game related information such as announcement or promotional area .

It is noted that the some of the embodiments described herein are described with reference to a poker game. However the principles presented herein to provide user communities within a game may be used for any game. For example online communities may be utilized in any casino online game e.g. Black Jack Roulette Craps Slots machines Hi Lo games etc. . In addition the embodiments presented here may also be used in non casino games such as battle games adventure games construction games etc. The embodiments illustrated herein should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment the attribute or attributes used to create a community are obtained from attributes from the user profiles. The attribute or attributes may be from profiles in the social network or from the profile created in the game or from a combination of attributes from the profile in the social network and the game profile.

As used herein a characteristic of a community determines which users belong to a community. The characteristic is defined as the attributes or combination of attributes with their respective values and the rules for combining the attributes if more than one attribute is used . For example a community may be created based on two attributes a relationship status of married and an age status between 30 and 40. The attributes used for creating this community are relationship status and age. The attribute values are married and between 30 and 40. The characteristic of this community includes the attributes of marital status and age the attribute values of married and between 30 and 40 and a logical connector of AND to combine the attribute values. The logical connector for combining attributes may be any logical connector or combinations thereof. For example the logical connectors may be one or more of logical AND logical OR logical NOT logical XOR etc.

In one embodiment the community may be created based on the single attribute. For example city of residence high school attended etc. In one embodiment a user must match exactly the attribute value to belong to the community e.g. school attended Stanford University and in another embodiment the user must match a value from a range of possible values e.g. age between 20 and 30 years old .

Some communities utilize a combination of attributes to determine which players belong to the community. For example a community may be formed for Stanford University singles which requires that the player must have a relationship status equal to single and have attended Stanford University.

Communities may be formed in many ways such as by age geography gender religion political affiliation being linked to a famous entity on the social network e.g. people that like the 49ers football team sports interests music affiliations etc.

The communities may be created automatically by the system based on attributes found in the profiles of users. The communities may also be created by game designers that specify characteristics for creating communities. In addition some communities may also be created by users which submit request to the game for creating a particular community. The game utilizes community creation rules to accept or deny community requests. More details with reference to the creation of communities are given below with reference to .

In one embodiment once a community is created the game network sends invitations to the members of the community to join the game to play in that community. In webpage the user has selected the Community tab within table selection area and the game displays a list of community poker tables where the player may play poker.

In one embodiment the community tab includes two types of tables. The first type of poker table is a community room table and the second type of poker table is a competition poker table. The community room table lists poker tables where the user can play and the competition table lists poker tables where the player may play as a team with other players against a second team.

The game also provides competitions between communities. For example a poker table may define a competition between Stanford and Yale alumni. This type of competition is referred to herein as a swarm community team playing rivalries competitions etc. Therefore a swarm community poker table may include players from two or more communities.

Competition table lists the swarm communities where the player may compete as a team against other teams. In one embodiment an indicator e.g. boldface font is provided to the user to let the user know in which team the user would play.

In one embodiment the community poker table may include some marks designs decorations etc. associated with the attribute or attributes that define the community. For example webpage includes the name of the table embedded within the poker table . In addition a community information area describes information about the community. Other embodiments may include other special decorations to customize the look of the poker table and its environment based on the community. The special decorations may include logos specially decorated playing cards signs on the walls or floors surrounding the poker table a custom dealer etc.

The poker table is surrounded by players . When a player enters the poker room the player selects an empty seat to sit in that spot. For each player the game displays the amount of chips available to the player at the table the amount bet in this hand and for the player playing the game the cards held by the player . The total amount of the pot is presented in the center of the table .

A chat area enables the users to exchange text messages. The messages may be sent to the whole table or to a particular player. In addition webpage includes a betting area for entering bets folding or checking during play.

In one embodiment the game allows players to get guest passes. A guest pass allows a player that is not part of a community to play in the community poker table or in a swarm community. In order to get a guest pass in one embodiment a player belonging to the community requests the guest pass from the game for a specific player and if approved the game sends the guest pass to the invited guest. The guest pass is useful to allow players to play with their friends in their preferred community tables. For example a player may invite his wife to play in his alumni table. In one embodiment the guest pass has a limited duration of time and in another embodiment a player is limited to the number of guest pass requests per period of time. However in one embodiment a player may buy guest passes using virtual currency or real currency.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts decorations etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment a leaderboard not shown is displayed describing the contribution to the team by players. For example the leaderboard may display the top 10 chip winners for a team although other types of leaderboards are also possible.

Additionally the poker table may include indicators that show to which community each player belongs. For example webpage includes logos and associated with the communities competing in the poker table.

In one embodiment the rivalry poker table includes half the players from one side and the other half from the other side. Of course since players only sit at the table one at a time one side may have one more player than the other side at certain times. In this case a player for the team having more players would not be able to sit at the table until the other team as a player to the table. In another embodiment there are no limits to the number of players from a team that can sit on the table. For example 2 players from one team may play against 4 players from the other team.

Once the players are in the game each player tries to win the most chips for her side. Competition leaderboards in the game display the status of the competitions including scores time left until the end of competition number of players stakes betting limits player leaderboards etc.

An invitation area includes one or more players that may be invited e.g. sent an invitation to play in the game. The members listed in the invitation area may be friends of the player or may be other random members of the community that are not socially linked with the player.

In one embodiment the game may create special events that have a limited duration. For example a poker night may be a competition lasting 12 hours between Stanford and Berkeley alumni. The competition may take place for example the day before the game between Stanford and Berkeley football teams. In one embodiment the game designers create a plurality of swarm communities based on common existing rivalries in real life.

In one embodiment the game provider may add additional poker tables as the community tables get full. That is a new community poker table is added when the current community poker table is full in order to allow more players in the community to play.

In one embodiment special events may be created for communities or swarm communities to raise funds for some cause e.g. charity school political party etc. . For example the game provider may give a percentage of earnings in a community poker table to the organization that created the specific event. For example a charity organization may create a poker night and the profits all of the profits or some of the profits of the poker night will go to the charity organization.

In one embodiment a special event may require the purchase of a special event virtual currency and regular currency may not be used in the special event. This guarantees that players joining the special event contribute to the event by having to buy new currency and not by using the poker chips that may have been accumulated over time.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts decorations virtual currencies seating charts leaderboards etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

Player P plays games utilizing client device executing a computer program.

In one embodiment game manager provides services to play an online poker game. In addition the game manager manages the game data stored for running the player s games although other modules may also access and change some of the game data. In one embodiment the functionality implemented by game manager includes presenting the game board to the player e.g. view of the lobby or the poker room presenting options to the player for purchasing virtual currency adding attributes to the profile purchase game assets betting synchronizing game operations with client managing communications with client etc.

Social manager manages the social interactions of the players which include determining the social links established within the social network. A player profile database includes the attributes added to the profile of players in the social network. The social network provides access to the player profiles via Application Programming Interfaces APIs or some other communication mechanisms.

The game network includes a plurality of games which are provided by the respective game managers . Game network manager manages the game network which includes providing common utilities to all the games provided by the same game publisher. The game network manager manages the addition and modifications to the player profiles entered into the game network. The player profile database includes the attributes entered by the players in the game network. In one embodiment there may be additional game profiles associated with respective games. Embodiments described herein may utilize the attributes entered by players in the game network or in the social network.

Community manager manages the creation of user communities for one or more games. Community manager access profile information from player profiles in the game network and player profiles from the social network. Community manager uses community creation rules to determine the creation of communities for the game network.

The community creation rules may include instructions from a game administrator to manually create communities. For example the game administrator may enter commands to create community community community etc. In addition the game administrator may provide rules to the community manager so users may request the creation of communities. The user created communities may be used to organize special events swarm communities around rivalries etc. In another embodiment the community manager utilizes logic to create communities by a computer program. For example community manager analyzes attributes entered by players in their profiles identifying characteristics that affect a plurality of players to create communities based on the identified characteristics.

The rules for user created communities may include one or more of listing a plurality of users for the community defining one or more attribute values to create a community defining an open community to be used in a special event for fund raising enable the combination of attribute values to create a community logic rules to identify which user created communities are possible e.g. a community must have a minimum number of players or a community may not exceed a predetermined number of players rules for blacklisting users e.g. ejecting players from a community for bad online behavior rules for reporting bad behavior in the community etc. In addition community creation rules may also include rules or policies for enabling guests into a community.

In one embodiment the community creation rules may also include data regarding special decorations or characteristics for community playing area e.g. poker room . In one embodiment a special lobby is created for one or more of the communities . The special lobby may include leaderboard information and other community related information.

To request the creation of a user created community a player may send a request to the game network manager to add a new community. The game network manager in cooperation with community manager provides an interface to the requester for creating a community. In one embodiment the interface includes the selection of one or more attributes from player profiles their respective allowed values for the attributes and how to combine the attributes if more than one attribute is provided.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different game modules different data modules combine the functionality of one or more modules into a single module etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment the attributes may include one or more of city of residence school attended age relationship status employer interests or relative relationship e.g. cousin . In another embodiment the characteristic is defined by a single attribute and a single value for the attribute e.g. marital status equal to married .

From operation the method flows to operation where a playing area is created in the game for the community. In one embodiment the playing area is a poker table but other playing areas may be created for other games e.g. blackjack table roulette table battleground etc. . The subset of players identified by the characteristic are allowed to play in the playing area and the players in the game that are not in the subset of players are disallowed from playing in the playing area.

From operation the method flows to operation where the subset of players previously identified in operation is enabled i.e. allowed to play in the playing area.

From operation the method flows to operation where a second subset of players is determined by the game. The second subset of players has a second characteristic which is based on attributes of the players in the game.

From operation the method flows to operation where a playing area is created in the game. The playing area provides an arena for two or more teams of players to compete. In one embodiment a first team and a second team are formed in the playing area. The first team is integrated by members of the first subset of players and the second team is integrated by members of the second subset of players.

From operation the method flows to operation where the first team and the second team are enabled to compete in the playing area. In one embodiment the game is a game of online poker and the playing area is a poker table.

Each game server has access to one or more game databases for keeping game data. In addition a single database can store game data for one or more online games. Each game server may also include one or more levels of caching. Game data cache is a game data cache for the game data stored in game databases . For increased performance caching may be performed in several levels of caching. For instance data more frequently used is stored in a high priority cache while data requiring less access during a session will be cached and updated less frequently.

The number of game servers changes over time as the gaming platform is an extensible platform that changes the number of game servers according to the load on the gaming infrastructure. As a result the number of game servers will be higher during peak playing times and the number of game servers will be lower during off peak hours. In one embodiment the increase or decrease of bandwidth is executed automatically based on current line usage or based on historical data.

One or more social network management servers provide support for the social features incorporated into the online games. The social network management servers access social data from one or more social networks via Application Programming Interfaces API made available by the social network providers. An example of a social network is Facebook but it is possible to have other embodiments implemented in other social networks. Each social network includes social data and this social data or a fraction of the social data is made available via API . As in the case of the game servers the number of social network management servers that are active at a point in time changes according to the load on the infrastructure. As the demand for social data increases the number of social network management servers increases. Social network management servers cache user data in database and social data in database . The social data may include the social networks where a player is present the social relationships for the player the frequency of interaction of the player with the social network and with other players etc. Additionally the user data kept in database may include the player s name demographics e mail games played frequency of access to the game infrastructure etc.
