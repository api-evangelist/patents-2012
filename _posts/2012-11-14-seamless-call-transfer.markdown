This invention relates generally to the call transfer and more specifically to the seamless transfer of a call during virtual desktop authentication.

Many virtual desktop environments include telephonic features. Such features may include facilitating phone calls call holding call forwarding emergency calling and directory services. In some systems in order to obtain a complete feature set for a telephone system a thin client hosting a virtual desktop environment may connect to remote computer systems.

In accordance with the present disclosure a seamless call transfer apparatus is provided which substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages and problems associated with previous systems and methods.

According to a particular embodiment a seamless call transfer apparatus is provided which includes a network interface a memory including an application and a processor capable of executing the application to implement various features. In particular the application can request access to a remote computer system for registration with a call manager determine whether a call associated with the apparatus is active automatically initiate suspension of the call in response to determining that the call is active and request registration of a telephone associated with the call and resume the suspended call. The registration may result in associating a new telephone number with the telephone.

Particular embodiments of the present invention may provide one or more technical advantages. For example certain embodiments may provide seamless transfer of an active call during an hosted virtual desktop authentication process such that the call is not lost or dropped. Particular embodiments may allow for a client or telephone associated with the client to acquire a new directory number managed by a call manager even though an active call is taking place. In addition certain embodiments may minimize the undesired latency associated with the seamless call transfer.

Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art in the following figures descriptions and claims. Moreover while specific advantages have been enumerated above various embodiments may include all some or none of the enumerated advantages.

Desktop virtualization is an information technology concept that abstracts the traditional computer desktop environment experienced by the user from the physical machine actually executing the corresponding applications and hosting the data files. Desktop virtualization may be implemented in a client server relationship. While the server may have significant computing resources in terms of processing power memory and communication bandwidth the clients may have significantly less computing resources. For this reason such clients may be referred to as thin clients. In such a model critical applications files and databases can be stored remotely at a secure location consistently maintained and preserved through regular backups with minimal interaction from individual users. In addition a user may access its computing environment from any thin client that can provide connectivity to the remote computer system hosting its applications and files. Thin clients may also be embodied in a mobile device such as a smart phone netbook or a tablet. Virtual desktop environments may be hosted by an organization or by a third party provider. Such systems may be referred to as hosted virtual desktops HVD .

As illustrated system includes a number of elements such as client telephone network and remote computer system that are interconnected to provide a hosted virtual desktop environment. Client represents a general purpose computer including appropriate hardware controlling logic and data that may be used to interface over a computer network with other system components such as remote computer system . For example client may be workstations laptops netbooks tablet computers personal data assistants PDAs smart phone tablet or any other suitable computing device. Client may support a wide variety of operations such as web browsing word processing and managing personal and business data. In certain embodiments client may support a basic set of computing functionality and require access to a hosted virtual desktop environment for complete functionality. According to particular embodiments client provides access potentially through web based interfaces to information managed by other elements such as telephone network or remote computer system . In some embodiments client may be a thin client that depends on remote computer systems such as remote computer system to accomplish traditional activities provided by a computer. For example client may act as a terminal that provides virtual access to a software applications and data hosted on a remote computer system .

A user may seek access using client and or telephone to a hosted virtual desktop environment provided by remote computer system . In certain embodiments a user may participate in active telephone communications even without being logged into the hosted virtual desktop environment. In those cases the set of telephonic features provided by client and or telephone may be basic and limited to essential functionality. Additional functionality may require seeking access to the hosted virtual desktop environment and or registration with remote call manager . For example the client and or telephone may use a default extension number which may be associated with a call manager . Once a user provides credentials and other connection related information application on client may execute appropriate logic to communicate over network to remote computer system using an interface . Client may also communicate with telephone as appropriate to obtain necessary information for registration and call related functionality. The authentication process with remote computer system may require processing by application and call manager . Communications from the remote computer system and client and or telephone over network may be facilitated by interface . As part of the authentication with the remote computer system to access the hosted virtual desktop environment application may communicate with call manager to provide a feature rich set of calling features for client and or telephone . In particular embodiments such communications may include registration and authentication with the call manager. For example registration may include an extension mobility authentication process. As a result of registration with the call manager a new directory number may be assigned to the client and or telephone to replace the default extension number which may not have been originally associated with the call manager of remote computer system . In some embodiments the new directory number and the default extension number may be the same.

In certain use cases a user may be actively engaged in a telephone conversation during login using client and or telephone . In those situations registration with the call manager and reassignment of directory numbers may result an active call being dropped or lost. According to the present disclosure in order to overcome this scenario application may detect the presence of an active telephone conversation during attempted authentication to the hosted virtual desktop environment and in response automatically suspend the call such that it can be retrieved shortly thereafter subsequent to authentication processes and call manager registration has taken place. In other embodiments this functionality may be performed at remote computer system by appropriate logic such as application . In some embodiments automatically suspending the call may involve parking the call placing the call on hold transferring the call without user intervention or other suitable actions. This is because once authentication and call manager registration has taken place the suspended call can be retrieved or activated to seamless resume normal call functionality. In particular embodiments the automatic suspension of the call only results in minimal impact on user experience.

While system is illustrated as including specific components arranged in a particular configuration it should be understood that various embodiments may operate using any suitable arrangement and collection of components capable of providing functionality such as that described.

In the illustration process flow includes a number of steps for providing seamless transfer of an active call during authentication to a hosted virtual desktop environment. As shown these steps include a login step an active call determination step a call suspension step a call registration step a call suspension determination step and a call resumption step . This collection of steps may be performed for example on a client such as a thin client or a remote computer system using appropriate authentication mechanisms.

In operation process flow begins at the login step . In this step the user of a thin client such as client supplies the appropriate credentials to access a virtual desktop environment hosted on one or more remote computer systems such as remote computer system . In addition to credentials the user may need to identify the specific remote computer system or particular applications or files that it seeks access to in particular embodiments. The level of authorization and access to applications and data may be determined by a user profile and permissions corresponding to the user. This information is sent across a network to the appropriate remote computer system hosting the virtualized desktop environment.

Next process flow proceeds to active call determination step . At this step the system determines whether an active call is in progress. For instance a user employing client and telephone may currently be engaged in an active telephone call when it seeks to login to the hosted virtual desktop environment and or register with the call manager. If the system determines that a call is in progress process flow proceeds to step . However if a call is not in progress process flow proceeds to call registration step .

If process flow has determined that an active call was in progress in step the call is automatically suspended in step . In operation such suspension may take place by parking the call transferring the call placing the call on hold or any other appropriate suspension mechanism. Suspension may occur automatically without user intervention. For example an active call may be suspended by parking the call to a temporary destination while the client registers with the call manager or performs additional authentication steps. In particular embodiments parking a call allows a user to place a call on hold at one destination having a particular telephone number and retrieve and continue the conversion from a telephone at another destination having a different telephone number. Thus when appropriate authentication processes are complete the call can be retrieved from the parked destination and continue seamlessly. In other embodiments call suspension may be performed by transferring the call to a new destination or by placing the call on hold to be retrieved later following the various authentication processes.

Next process flow continues to call registration step where the client and or telephone may register with the call manager. In particular embodiments registering with the call manager results in a new directory number being assigned to the client and or telephone. This new directory number may replace any default directory number assigned to the client and or telephone. In some embodiments the new directory number and the default directory number may be the same number. Registration with the call manager may also result in a rich feature set being provided to the client and or telephone. In certain embodiments call manager registration may be executed by performing an extension mobility EM login at the call manager. Once call manager registration is complete process proceeds to call suspension determination step . In this step the system determines whether the a previously active call was suspended. If there was a previously suspended call process flow proceeds to call resumption step where the call is retrieved or activated as appropriate. The manner in which a call is resumed may depend on the way the call was originally suspended. For example in particular embodiments retrieving an active call may involve requesting and receiving access to a parked call. In other embodiments resuming the call may involve activating a call that is on hold or accessing a transferred call.

Although process flow is illustrated as including specific steps it should be understood that various embodiments may implement a seamless call transfer scheme using any appropriate combination of steps for seamless call transfer during virtual desktop authentication and call manager registration. For example the steps of process flow may be performed in any suitable order that facilitates the type of suspension of an active call being performed. In particular embodiments the call manager registration step may occur before a call is suspended in call suspension step . During call manager registration step a new directory number may be assigned to a client and or telephone. Once call manager registration is complete an active call may be seamlessly transferred from its existing directory number to the new directory number. This may reduce or otherwise limit the latency or undesired effects on the user experience during the call.

In certain embodiments additional steps may be added to process flow to allow an appropriate message to be displayed when a call is suspended and or when a call is resumed. This message may allow the user to cancel or delay the seamless transfer. According to particular implementations the system may or may not perform these tasks.

In other embodiments process flow could be modified such that interaction with the remote computer system in step may not be necessary. For example the client may login and register directly with call manager using Extension Mobility EM . Thus process flow may perform the disclosed seamless transfer without direct interaction with remote computer system .

Although the present invention has been described in several embodiments a myriad of changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art and it is intended that the present invention encompass such changes and modifications as fall within the scope of the present appended claims.
