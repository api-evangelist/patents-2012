The described embodiments relate to systems and methods for capturing event feedback and in particular to systems and methods for capturing event feedback from event observers using devices.

Events such as for example artistic performances political debates competitions and movies may attract an audience of event observers. Event performers may have an active role in the event and event observers may have a passive role in the event. Event observers may want to provide their opinion of the event in the form of feedback. Feedback in the form of applause or jeers may only be received during live events and may be disruptive and sometimes unwelcome. When event feedback is received from event performers event organizers and event observers it may be difficult to accurately associate received feedback to specific portions of the event that the feedback pertains to.

Neilson ratings assess whether a television show was watched or not but may not discern between high points and low points in a television show. Some polling methods require observers to be located at one location such as for example a studio environment to score an event. Often in such cases the number of observers will be limited. Some polling methods require observers to wait until the end of the event to understand how other observers liked or disliked the entire event. A numerical scale may be used to rate an event but such numerical feedback is typically received at the end of the event and a scalar number representing the average value is recorded for the event as a whole. Some event observers may have biases that make it difficult to get an accurate assessment of an event based on isolated or anecdotal observations. Polling methods may not determine the interstitial reactions during an event.

Reference is first made to which illustrates a block diagram of a system for capturing event feedback in accordance with at least one embodiment. System includes a server system operable to receive feedback indicia for an event from devices operated by event observers observing the event . In some embodiments system can accommodate observers to providing feedback for the event from a number of different locations. In some other embodiments the location of the venue from where the observers to can provide feedback may be limited. In other embodiments observers to can provide feedback from any location. In various embodiments any number of observers providing feedback can be accommodated by the system . In various other embodiments system is operable to receive feedback from observers to at different times. System may also receive feedback from observers in different time zones such as for example in California and New York State for the same event being broadcasted a few hours apart. Even within the same time zone system can receive feedback from observers to for the same event using different devices even when the observers are close in proximity and time. System can also be operable to receive feedback from observers to for the event any time after it is over or any time in the future for example.

System is operable to receive feedback indicia throughout the period of time for the event to continuously evaluate the event . Server system is operable to generate feedback results by aggregating and statistically analyzing the received feedback indicia and provide representations of the feedback results to devices operated by the event observers and to beneficiaries such as an interested party and a proxy for example.

System is operable to enable event observers also referred to herein as observers to share the mutual experience of the event and their collective reaction throughout the event by providing and sharing feedback indicia and receiving feedback results throughout the event . System may enable observers and beneficiaries such as an interested party and a proxy to monitor the reactions of other observers at key moments of the event. That is system provides a tool that assists the beneficiaries in evaluating feedback results for the event generated by aggregating feedback indicia received from event observers .

System may use the feedback results to evaluate or score periods of time of an event. The feedback results may aid an event organizer as an example beneficiary or host in determining what satisfies the event observers who may be consumers. The feedback results may assist marketers as another example beneficiary in identifying prime exposure time windows for more targeted advertising campaigns. The feedback results may provide the required input data to determine an outcome of the current event or future occurrences of the event . System may give an active role to event observers to by enabling the event observers to to provide feedback indicia throughout the event .

An event may be any observable phenomenon. An event is associated with an event timeline where the event timeline defines a period of time for the event. An event may be live or recorded. It may be directly observed or otherwise provided for event observers to such as by broadcast file transmission or otherwise. Event may also be provided by a satellite provider cable provider or webcast. Examples of events include concerts sporting events television programs web based media personal parties movies political events reality shows a meeting a class a seminar a conference an artistic performance and so on. In essence an event may be anything that can cause event observers to to respond with feedback indicia.

Optionally server system may include an event transformer configured to alter the progress of or outcome of an event . An event may be associated with a plurality of event outcomes. Server system may select an event outcome based on the received feedback indicia and provide the selected event outcome. Server system may alter or control the event by implementing the selected event outcome. Server system may prompt for additional feedback indicia based on the selected event outcome.

For example the event may be a movie television show online media or other media with a dynamic story line. Observers through feedback may influence which story line is chosen as the event with the dynamic story line progresses. As an example the event may be a reality show. Reality show producers may use the feedback results during a live production to influence the show. The event may be a political debate. Receiving moment by moment feedback indicia from event observers during political speeches may enable politicians to determine the perception from most favorable to most unfavorable of each statement or position taken during the speech. The event may relate to education or business. A meeting organizer where the meeting could be a class seminar conference or business meeting for example can use feedback results generated by feedback indicia received in response to questions asked by the meeting presenter to ask additional questions selected by system based on the feedback results. System is operable to display the feedback results immediately in the presenter s charts. Additionally the effectiveness of presenters can be evaluated moment by moment for immediate or future use. The event may be a sporting event or artistic performance. Part of the fun of attending a sporting event or performance is the roar of the crowd . This aspect may be missing when event observers view the event remotely. System can break down geography and bring together the virtual crowd of event observers . This may add enjoyment to the game or performance and makes the fan reaction interactive among fans.

System includes network to connect a server system a host device operated by a host a plurality of devices for receiving feedback indicia from event observers and beneficiaries including an interested party and a proxy . Although only one event is shown system is configured to receive feedback indicia and generate feedback results for multiple events. In some embodiments system is configured to receive feedback indicia and generate feedback results for multiple events simultaneously. In this example event is associated with computing components configured to connect to system via network in order to provide input data and receive output data such as feedback results. However in some embodiments event may not be associated with components capable of connecting to system via network or otherwise may not connect to system . In some embodiments the input data can be stored locally on device until connection to a network is made available to the observers to

Network may be any network s capable of carrying data including the Internet Ethernet plain old telephone service POTS line public switch telephone network PSTN integrated services digital network ISDN digital subscriber line DSL coaxial cable fiber optics satellite mobile wireless e.g. Wi Fi WiMAX SS7 signaling network fixed line local area network wide area network and others including any combination of these. Although not shown devices server system and other components may connect to network via a firewall which is a device set of devices or software that inspects network traffic passing through it and denies or permits passage based on a set of rules and other criteria. Firewall may be adapted to permit deny encrypt decrypt or proxy all computer traffic between network and devices server system and other components based upon a set of rules and other criteria. For example firewall may be a network layer firewall an application layer firewall a proxy server or a firewall with network address translation functionality.

Host device is operable by a host and may be any networked computing device including a processor and memory such as a personal computer workstation server portable computer mobile device personal digital assistant laptop smart phone WAP phone an interactive television video display terminals gaming consoles an electronic reading device and portable electronic devices or a combination of these. Host may be anyone such as for example one or more individuals companies or businesses or anything such as for example an automated computer system that registers one or more events or one or more aspects of events with server system . In some embodiments host may need to enter an agreement with server system before being able to register events . In various embodiments no agreements are required between host and server system prior to registration of events by the host . Although for clarity only one host device is illustrated in there may be more host devices connected via network . Host device may include a host client which may be a computing application application plug in a widget instant messaging application mobile device application e mail application online telephony application java application web page or web object residing or rendered on the host device in order to access the functionality of system . Host device is operable by a host to for example register an event make a reservation for receiving feedback for an event and specify the computational resources needed for evaluating an event . An event may also refer to various aspects of the same event . For example in a case of a political debate a host or a host device may register various aspects of this event such as for example political debate reviewed as Republican political debate reviewed as Democrat or political debate reviewed as Independent etc.

Server system is operable to provide the host with options for obtaining and recording feedback indicia for an event from the devices operated by observers . The host device is operable to configure the server system for aggregating analyzing packaging and distributing the feedback indicia received from the event observers . The host device operated by a host may make a reservation for receiving feedback for an event which may entail registering an event record for the event with the server system if an event record for the event does not exist already for example and authenticate the host device with the server system . A host device may specify the parameters for aggregating analyzing packaging and distributing of event related data. The event record may comprise an event timeline event objects event parameters and event variables which may be created generated determined and stored throughout the event in response to input data such as feedback indicia and other data such as feedback results.

The host device may specify parameters for receiving feedback indicia for the event the type of feedback indicia aggregating the received feedback indicia for the event processing and analyzing the received feedback indicia for the event generating feedback results based on the received feedback indicia for the event and providing and distributing the generated feedback results. Specifying parameters is optional and the server system may be configured with default parameters if event parameters are not specified by host device . Server system may store the parameters in association with the event record. Optionally the host device may provide server system with configurations for creating a unique event experience for one or more observers by customizing the appearance of a visual display of the client on each associated device . Server system may create unique event experience for one or more observers by using logos graphic displays designs and other industry nuances and by specifying one or more metaphor s used on the client to receive feedback indicia.

The host device may also provide configurations to create a suite of one or more metaphors for the event record from which one or more observers can select. The host device may specify that metaphors and the visual appearance of the client may change either statically or dynamically in response to received feedback indicia feedback results a milepost or instruction from the server system . In some other embodiments the host or host device may allow the client to generate a selected subset of metaphors from which an observer can select one metaphor of choice.

In some embodiments the host device may allow the server system to dynamically provide one or more clients with themes corresponding to the feedback indicia received from the same client where the themes may include images audio clips etc. related to the event being observed. For instance if an observer is evaluating an event such as a movie and providing a positive feedback for various scenes or background scores the host device may allow the server system to dynamically provide images or audio clips to the client in order to change the appearance of the client to create a unique experience for the observer . In various embodiments the observers may have the option of accepting or rejecting the themes provided by the server system .

When a host device makes a reservation for receiving feedback for an event the server system is operable to determine whether an event record exists for the event and if not to create an event record for the event. The server system is operable to generate a reservation identifier to identify the specific host device that made the reservation for receiving feedback for the event and create a link between the reservation identifier and the event record. The reservation identifier maybe a unique identifier issued by server system when a host device makes a reservation for an event. Server system may use the reservation identifier or other identifier to create a link between the host device and the event record. The host device may also declare that the reservation identifier is accessible to all observers or only accessible to a specific list of observers . Server system provides the host device with the reservation identifier which may be shared with the potential observers of the event through an invitation. Server system provides the host device with confirmation of options specified in the reservation.

When server system creates an event record the server system generates and assigns an event identifier to the event record. The event identifier maybe a unique identifier issued by server system upon creating an event record to register an event. The event identifier may be a unique token based identifier such as a string of characters or may be a relative identifier defining the event record relative to other data. Server system may use the event identifier to identify and recall an event record. In accordance with some embodiments server system generates one event identifier for each event record. Server system is operable to generate one or more reservation identifier for each host device that makes a reservation for receiving feedback indicia an event. For example server system may create an event record for a baseball game and assign one event identifier to that event record. One host device may make a reservation to receive feedback indicia in relation to dance entertainment at the baseball game another host device may make a reservation to receive feedback indicia in relation to food at the baseball game and a further host device may make a reservation to receive feedback indicia in relation to the batting at the baseball game. In response server system is operable to create three different reservation identifiers each associated with the same event record and event identifier where each reservation identifier creates a link between the host device that made the reservation and the event record. There may be only one event identifier assigned to each event record but there may be multiple reservation identifiers associated with each event record creating a link between different host devices and the respective event record.

In some embodiments only one host device can register an event record or make a reservation for receiving feedback indicia for the event such that there is only one host device associated with the event . In other embodiments multiple host devices can make a reservation for the same event . Server system is operable to register only one event record for the event even if there are multiple reservations for the event or multiple event records for the same event but associated with each other. Each host device obtains their own reservation identifier for their respective reservation for the same event . A host device may create multiple reservations for the same event and obtain multiple reservation identifiers for the same event in order to for example receive different types of feedback indicia for the event . Further a host device may register multiple events or may make multiple reservations for different events .

Device is an instrument capable of receiving input from an observer providing the received input to client carrying out client instructions and communicating with the server system . Devices are operable by event observers and may be any networked computing device including a processor and memory such as a personal computer workstation server portable computer mobile device personal digital assistant laptop smart phone WAP phone an interactive television video display terminals gaming consoles an electronic reading device tablets other portable electronic devices device simulators such as embedded applications in websites or consumer electronics or a combination of these. Although for clarity only three devices are illustrated in there may be more devices connected via network . The illustrated devices may be different types of devices. Devices may include a client which may be a computing application application plug in a widget instant messaging application mobile device application e mail application online telephony application java application web page or web object residing or rendered on the respective devices in order to access the functionality of system . Devices will be described in more detail herein in relation to .

Device is operable to carry out instructions and communicate with the server system . The communication may be done directly via network or it may be done indirectly through removable storage or other means. A single device may support a single observer such as their mobile phone for example. A single device may also support multiple observers such as an embedded application in a website or consumer electronics for example. A single device may support multiple observers and may contain multiple clients one per observer 

Client may be a set of instructions running on a device capable of receiving observer feedback indicia and transmitting to server system . Device may come pre loaded with a client or may automatically upgrade itself with a client . An observer may download or load a client on the device . The device may be simulated in a website that contains the client . The device contains hardware and software modules to receive observer input data from input devices such as a keypad and hardware services for determining and recording environmental indicia for provision to the client . That is device is operable to receive input data and provide the received input data to client . Client is operable to convert the received input data into feedback indicia. For example device may receive a value of 4 as input data for provision to client . Client is operable to process the input value to convert the value of 4 into feedback indicia. As another example device may receive biometric indicia such as a heart rate or pulse rate value as input data for provision to client . Client is operable to process the input value to convert the heart rate or pulse rate value into feedback indicia such as a metric indicating how excited an observer . Device may also receive environmental indicia as input data for provision to client . Client is operable to process the environmental indicia for conversion into feedback indicia such as a metric indicating the geographic location of the observer . Examples of environmental indicia include but are not limited to date time longitude latitude altitude acceleration sound levels images videos temperature light levels colors smell and so on. The client converts the received input data into feedback indicia and instructs the device to send a transmission of the feedback indicia to the server system . In addition the device forwards transmissions of feedback results and other data received from the server system to the client .

An observer is an entity that observes the event and conveys their reaction by providing input data to a device with a client . For example the observer may rate a sporting event on a scale of 1 to 10 by providing rating values as keyboard input to device throughout the game. Client is operable to convert the received input values rating values into feedback indicia. An observer responds to his or her perception of the event by providing input data to the device as real time feedback which client converts into feedback indicia for provision to the server system as the event occurs. If an observer is using a personal device the observer may be required to obtain a copy of the client on their device . For example an observer may download a client from a computing application repository. In some embodiments the downloaded client may be operable to automatically update itself or its version number. In some other embodiments the downloaded client may be operable to notify the observer that a new version is available and may update itself or its version number if the observer permits it for example. Real time may mean that the feedback is provided in real time in relation to the event timeline. For example if the event is a live event then the feedback will be provided while the event is occurring or thereafter in reference to mileposts or a period or instance of time on the event timeline. If the event is a recorded event then the client is operable to determine when in the event timeline the feedback was received in order to correlate the received feedback to the event timeline. Real time may mean that feedback indicia are received timely and continuously. For example for a sporting event the feedback indicia may be received continuously via a slider bar an example of a metaphor where the device enables an observer to move the slider bar up and down throughout the event . Each position on the slider bar may correspond to a rating value which is an example of feedback indicia. In this example device and client are operable to convert the position of the slider bar into feedback indicia.

In various embodiments the observer uses the client and device to register or create an account with the server system after the client is on the observer s device . The observer can use the client and device to register for one or more events and to provide feedback indicia for one or more event. Registration account creation may include providing information such as name phone number email address demographics and geo demographics for example which may or may not be provided to the host device associated with the event . When sufficient account information has been received from the client and device the server system assigns an observer identifier and creates an observer record indexed by the observer identifier or other data relating to the observer .

In preparation for the event the observer uses client to review a list of available events. Events may be identified in the list by reservation identifiers event identifiers and other identifiers. The list of available events may be provided by the server system . Server system is operable to generate a list of events by selecting one or more events that were previously registered by hosts . Observer uses device to select an event to evaluate from the list of events. The list may contain all publically available events private events available for the specific observer or events that are most relevant to the observer such as those events geographically proximate to the observers location events for a certain time or those events that the observer has been invited to or a combination thereof. Client provides an interface to search for events and to display identified events.

During the event the observer can provide input data which corresponds to feedback indicia to the device and client and in some embodiments the observer provides input data which corresponds to feedback indicia using metaphors. The metaphors may be configured and specified by the host server system or client . Metaphors enable the collection of input data as feedback indicia and may facilitate the provision and receipt of feedback indicia. In other words metaphors may be useable by the observers to input a variable human feedback rating. Example metaphors include but are not limited to sliders questions buttons scale rating stars icons and a point on an image. Other examples of metaphor include odometers drop down boxes dials number choosers search boxes accordion panes horizontal vertical panes checkboxes pickers choosers cover flows scroller menus lists on off switch playback controls reverse play forward progress bar radio buttons tabs tag cloud tooltip callout rating stars rating thermometers hot cold metaphors joystick metaphor time scroller animated images a video gauges sprites keyboard scales hand gestures simulated hand gestures clapping hands clapping on the Internet by for example activation or repeated use of a button etc. If the metaphor is a slider or slider bar then each position along the slider bar corresponds to a rating value feedback indicia . If the metaphor is a question then each response corresponds to feedback indicia and so on. Using the supplied metaphors the observer conveys their evaluation to the client as input data to the device . Also during the event the observer may be able to see information received from the server system summarizing and aggregating the feedback from other observers of the event feedback received so far from the observer and provide input data which corresponds to feedback indicia based on the feedback results for the event and so on.

The client may be a set of instructions for execution by a processor or application resident on a device . The client is operable to authenticate or register with the server system so forthcoming transmissions may be identified as coming through an identified client . The client requests from the server system a list of events identified as event identifiers reservation identifiers and so on that are available to the observer . The client displays the list of available events or reservation identifiers event identifiers and so on from which the observer can select. The client relays the observer selections to the server system to begin a session of giving receiving event feedback indicia. The client receives from the server system salient parts of the reservation for feedback for an event made by the host in order to capture and transmit observer feedback indicia to the server system . The client may require that feedback indicia be received in accordance with the specifications and parameters or may receive feedback indicia in any format. The client is configurable to utilize different themes visual appearances or other variations to display and capture input data as feedback indicia and other data. The client may provide a manifestation of the observer s reaction feedback indicia through movements on the device such as touches on the device vibration keystrokes pointing devices and so on. The manifestation of the observer s intent received as input data may be transmitted to the client through the device using the metaphors and other mechanisms for receiving input data. The client is operable to convert the received input data into corresponding feedback indicia. The client is also operable to receive environmental indicia supplied by the device .

When the client obtains feedback indicia and other input data it is operable to transmit the feedback indicia and data to the server system . The client may perform processing and normalization on the feedback indicia prior to provision to server system in order to ensure that the feedback indicia is a format compatible with the server system . The client may use synchronous communication asynchronous communication batch communication and so on. Under certain conditions the client and device may not be able to access network or connect with server system and in such case the client will retain the data until transmission is possible. The client is operable to locally store a copy of all or part of the data transmitted to server system .

If specified by the host device the client may be entitled to packaged or aggregated information feedback results returned by the server system which may be received asynchronously for example to the transmission of observer input data and feedback indicia. In various embodiments the server system puts the received input data into a relational database for immediate reuse and analysis and therefore presents feedback results as an event occurs. In such embodiments completion of the event by all observers is not a requirement for analysis of the received feedback indicia. In some other embodiments the server system processes the input data as it is being received by using data stream mining techniques. Data stream mining is a process of extracting knowledge structures from continuous rapid data records such as the received input data. The client is operable to provide a user interface to display feedback results generated by server system for consumption by the observer . Examples of consumable forms include text graphs charts grids images metaphors video and so on. For example a chart may plot aggregate feedback results received from all observers against time corresponding to an event timeline. The client may also juxtapose or compare the observer s own feedback results against the feedback results of other observers or receive such comparison data from the server system in the form of feedback results for display to observer . For example a chart may plot feedback values received from specific observers against aggregate feedback results received from all other observers or a subset thereof.

Server system comprises one or more servers with computing processing abilities and memory such as database s or file system s . For example server system may include a mail server web server database server application server message queue server and so on. Although only one server system is shown for clarity there may be multiple server systems or groups of server systems distributed over a wide geographic area and connected via e.g. network . For each event tracked by system server system is operable to register an event record and assign an event identifier to the registered event record. The event record is associated with an event and an event timeline which defines a period of time for the event. Server system is operable to uniquely identify and correlate feedback indicia for each event using reservation identifiers event identifiers and other identifiers. Server system receives feedback indicia for the event from a plurality of devices operated by event observers . Each feedback indicia is associated with an event timestamp that is associated with a point in time within the event timeline. In some embodiments the feedback indicia is based on an ISO 8601 standard also known as a Unix time standard or wall time so that the feedback indicia can be compared with events within or outside of the system for example. In some other embodiments the feedback indicium is based on the elapsed time or the runtime of the event . In various embodiments the runtime is derived from the wall time. Server system is operable to store the received feedback indicia for the event in association with the event record. Server system is operable to generate feedback results for the event based on received feedback indicia. The feedback results include a vector of feedback result values for the event where each feedback result value is associated with a point in time within the event timeline and computed by aggregating the received feedback indicia for the event based on their associated event timestamps. For example at a point in time within the event timeline multiple observers may provide feedback indicia. Server system is operable to aggregate the feedback indicia received from all observers and linked to that point in time. Server system is operable to provide a representation of the feedback results to host device device beneficiaries such as an interested party or a proxy or other device.

Server system coordinates activity and data among hosts observers milepost creators and beneficiaries such as an interested party and proxy . Before the event the server system is operable to receive data from the host device and host client . The server system is operable to authenticate and authorize the host host device and the host client to provide information necessary to register the event by creating an event record and to create a reservation for receiving feedback data for the event and generate a corresponding reservation identifier. The data received from the host device is stored for use when observers observe the event by providing input data that corresponds to feedback indicia. If reservations of other systems are required e.g. cloud capacity the server system is operable to make the appropriate reservations. When sufficient data is received for event registration the server system generates an event record or a reservation for receiving feedback for an event .

The server system sends a client a list of events identified by event identifiers reservation identifiers and so on. The list of events includes events granted public access by hosts and events granted access to the observer by hosts and other relevant events. The host may communicate event invitations and the server system may also be directed by the host to send event invitations by push or pull technology for example. Server system may send an electronic invitation prompting for feedback indicia for an event to the devices where the electronic invitation configures the device to send feedback indicia for the event .

Before receiving feedback indicia and generating and providing feedback results for the event the server system communicates with the client to configure how the client manifests itself to the observer . An initial metaphor or manifestation may be changed by the server system during an event in response to received input data feedback indicia feedback results and so on. As the event progresses the server system receives the observer feedback indicia sent by the client on the device . In some embodiments the server system uses the pull technology where the server system polls the device or client to pull the data from the device . In some other embodiments the server system uses the push technology also known as an event driven model to receive feedback indicia from the device or client . In other words only the observer created events are pushed to the server system when they occur. In an example using a slider metaphor the only positions recorded are due to the movement of the slider by the observer . When the slider is stationary because of no change in the observer input no information is recorded. This may introduce more efficiency in the system by not recording redundant data and by precisely recording the time when the observer actually provides an input such as by moving the slider. The use of push technology also prevents the transmission of redundant environmental indicia or data to the server system only a change in the environmental indicia is transmitted. The server system aggregates and processes the received feedback indicia from all observers for use in the analyzing packaging and distributing feedback results. The server system analyzes the raw feedback indicia including but not limited to aggregating the received feedback indicia using a correlation based on an event or feedback timestamp analysis of the data for purposes of validation including checks for counterfeit submissions or incorrectness validating format of feedback indicia generating feedback results generating comparisons for specific observers analysis of the data for greater understanding of the observer intent including but not limited to removing bias or statistical noise in the data examples of validation and processing of the data so that it can be more easily or completely understood including but not limited to correlating it with the environmental indicia or other data and or summarizing feedback results in charts graphs tables and any other form for presentation. The server system may aggregate and analyze the input data or feedback indicia based on many characteristics such as for example time of rating of the event by observers time the rating is sent to the server system or GPS locations of the observers etc.

The server system may be the computational resource that receives aggregates analyses packages and distributes observers feedback data including feedback indicia and feedback results . The server system is operable to package the feedback results according to the specification given by the host . This includes but is not limited to metaphors used in collecting the data the number of observers actual and invited the time spent by observers using the metaphors geographic location type duration and number of data points provided by the observers statistical analysis generated from observers moment by moment reactions to the event comparison of one set of observer reactions to another set of observers statistical filtering to remove noise in the data biases detected during the event validation information raw data in export formats e.g. CSV XML JSON etc. and so on.

The server system is operable to distribute the packaged information and feedback results according to requests received from the host client or client s . If authorized by the host the server system is operable to transmit the feedback results or a portion thereof immediately back to each client on the device . If authorized by the host the server system is operable to make the information such as the feedback results available to authorized beneficiaries in such forms such as reports web services exported data formats and so on.

An event timeline defines a period of time for the event . The event timeline may define a collection of mileposts where each milepost may be a reference to a point in time within the event timeline. The event timeline may be annotated to indicate when certain moments of the events are of particular interest. Milepost creator may create mileposts within the event timeline. Although shown separately in the client the host client and server system may each contain a milepost creator or a combination thereof. The milepost creator defines mileposts of the event timeline that are used to aggregate chart and compare received feedback indicia. Milepost creator may identify a point or period of time on the event timeline as milepost before or after feedback indicia has been received in relation to that period of time or milepost. The client the host client and server system are operable to associate at least some of the received feedback indicia with one or more mileposts. For example the feedback indicia may include an indication that it is associated with a milepost or the event time stamp associated with the received feedback indicia may correlate to a milepost of point in time of the event timeline . Examples of mileposts include the moment of conflict resolution in a movie plot the throwing of a knock out punch in a boxing event or the funny part of a YouTube video the end of an inning or period in sporting event a goal and so on. The annotation to the timeline or creation of mileposts may be made before during or after the observers observe the event by providing feedback indicia. The milepost annotations are used to correlate observers feedback indicia to important moments identified within an event . A milepost is a reference to a point in or period of time in an event timeline. It may optionally include a description. A milepost creator is an entity that creates mileposts on the event timeline.

In some embodiments the host or other beneficiaries may only be interested in receiving feedback with respect to one or more segments of interest within an event . For instance for an event such as a football match being broadcasted live certain parties such as advertisers may only be interested in receiving feedback regarding advertisement segments during the duration of the match. In such situations creation of mileposts may facilitate comparison or aggregation of received feedback. In the football match example the identification of a point or period of time of interest within the event timeline might be complicated if the match is being broadcasted on different channels where the various channels have a slight time delay with respect to each other. Further complications may arise if certain channels decide to play the advertisement segments of interest to an advertiser in different order or at different times than some other channels during the duration of the match.

Similar to the football match example determining segments of interest within an event timeline may be complicated with respect to certain other events such as a Broadway show where the event may occur multiple times such as every night for a week or weekly for a month etc. Receiving and aligning feedback from observers watching the performance on various nights to determine the progress or popularity of the show or to compare feedback for the show night after night may require use of mileposts. However some complication may arise since the event may not start at the same time each night it is performed and may have a slightly different duration or length of performance on different nights. In other words either the start time of the event may vary each time it is performed such as the show may start at 8 00 p.m. on one night but 8 10 p.m. on the next night or the length of the event may vary each time it is performed such as on one night the show may be 90 minutes long but on the next night it may be 100 minutes long . Further complication may arise if for instance the producers are interested in comparing feedback results with respect to a performance by a leading lady of the show every night where the leading lady of the show commences performance 10 minutes into the show on one night but 15 minutes into the show the next night.

In order to enable the comparison or aggregation of feedback received from different observers from different channels or different nights a tag or label may be provided by a user or a host or any third party where the tag or label along with other related information about the segment of interest may facilitate the determination of the start and end times of the segment. In some embodiments an observer or a third party may themselves using the client relay the segment start time along with the segment duration to the milepost creator . In some other embodiments an observer or a third party may relay the segment start time and the segment end time to the milepost creator . In yet other embodiments segment start time segment duration or segment end time may be automatically determined based on the tag or label provided to the milepost creator .

The milepost creator may be operable to use the segment related information for instance such as segment start time segment duration or segment end time to analyze feedback data corresponding to that segment. In one embodiment the milepost creator may adjust the various feedback data and the associated timestamps to correspond to a common timeline thereby facilitating an easy comparison of various feedback results. For instance referring back to the Broadway show example the milepost creator may aggregate feedback results for each night based on a common timescale thereby making it easy to compare the observer response from one night to observer response from another night.

Milepost creator may be configured to automatically create mileposts in the event timeline from triggers in the event. For example for live events one knows certain types of triggers actions will occur but do not know the exact time that these will occur. Examples of triggers may be scoring a goal in a hockey or soccer game the beginning or end of a boxing round the appearance of a singer in a talent related reality TV show a speaker taking the microphone at various times during a political debate.

Milepost creator may be configured to allow a host when registering an event or making a reservation to select or enter types of triggers and the corresponding milepost. When a trigger action occurs the host may signal that the trigger action has occurred to create the corresponding milepost. Alternatively the milepost creator may receive trigger signals from any third party to automatically create mileposts without host involvement. This may be for example a third party service that sends alerts any time an action has occurred in a sporting event. In some embodiments input to the server system can be provided by a device that directly measures the event . For example in a Broadway show a mixing board can be used to send signals identifying a sound mix as input to the server system or a light board can be used to send signals identifying when certain lights are adjusted in brightness or color as input to the server system . Another example is of a sporting event such as football where a device detecting a whistle of a referee can send a signal as an input to the server system upon detection of the whistle likewise a device detecting a goal in a hockey or basketball game can send a signal as an input to the server system upon detection of the goal. Another example is of a marching band where a device could be strapped to the wrist of a drum major to detect a beat of the corps and a signal can be send as input to the server system upon detection of the beat. In such embodiments the measuring of the event by a device could be used in the detection of mileposts.

In some embodiments a host or any third party may provide a threshold amount to the milepost creator where the threshold amount is used to determine if a trigger event qualifies as a milepost. The milepost creator may be operable to analyze all the feedback received from an observer with respect to an event to determine a significant change in the received feedback. The threshold amount may be used to determine if a change is significant or not. If a significant jump or a drop in the feedback data is identified it may tentatively signify a milepost. The milepost creator may then compare the various tentative mileposts to determine confirmed mileposts.

In some other embodiments the milepost creator may first aggregate all the received feedback before identifying a significant change a jump or a drop in the aggregate results by comparing it to a threshold amount.

Furthermore any milepost created from a trigger action may further cause a change in the user interface of client or change in metaphor. The server system may further be configured to allow a host when registering an event to select how the metaphor will change in response to the creation of a milepost. For example the scoring of goal in a sporting event may cause a metaphor showing cheer and boo to appear at the client so that the observer can provide feedback pertaining to the trigger action in the event .

Milepost creator may be configured to create mileposts automatically based on for example observer feedback indicia. For example peeks or drops in viewer ratings or increases or decreases in the number of viewers providing feedback might identify a milepost.

A beneficiary may be an entity deriving value from the analysis of the observation data and generated feedback results. Example beneficiaries include event producers advertisers observers hosts and so on. Beneficiaries may be sub categorized as interested parties proxies milepost creator and event transformers . Although shown separately in one or more of interested parties proxies milepost creator and event transformers may be illustrated within beneficiaries as it is a sub category thereof. Interested parties may be any user interested in the information and feedback results. Event transformers may be entities that use feedback results to alter the progression of the event . Proxies may be entities that convey the feedback results and data derived from the feedback results to an interested party . A proxy may be a beneficiary that conveys the value of the packaged data to another interested party.

In accordance with some embodiments the host may specify if the feedback results are available for a beneficiary . A beneficiary may be an entity such as for example a person computing program or computing device that receives analyzed information such as feedback results distributed from the server system and derives value from the analysis of observer feedback indicia and other data. This may or may not be the host . Beneficiary types include event transformers interested parties milepost creators and proxies . In some embodiments the host may configure the server system to output or post the real time analysis of the feedback indicia to third party social media applications such as for example Facebook Twitter etc. The server system is operable to receive configuration parameters from one or more host observer and beneficiaries in order to generate a specific type of feedback results tailored to the respective host observer beneficiary or other third parties. That is server system is operable to generate and provide different feedback results for different hosts observers and beneficiaries etc. For example a host who creates a reservation for feedback for an event may specify as configuration parameters to set the scope of feedback indicia and feedback results that may be provided to a beneficiary . As a further example a beneficiary may specify the format of the feedback results that it is permitted to receive.

An event transformer is a beneficiary that uses packaged information including feedback results to alter the progression of the event . An event transformer may be entities that use feedback results to alter the progression of the event and may be a gateway to a feedback loop. An event transformer may be used by server system if part of an event can be modified automatically. The event transformer may process the feedback results in order to automatically determine how the event should unfold or the server system may process the feedback results to determine how the event should unfold and instruct the event transformer accordingly. Examples of parts of an event that can be modified include the order of songs performed in a concert topics chosen during a speech charts shown during a presentation media that support alternative formats a dynamic story line and so on. The event transformer is a specific type of a beneficiary . When the event transformer receives the feedback results or instruction from the server system it may alter the course of the event . The event transformer is operable to make decision on how the event should progress given the options available at that time for the event . Example modifications include reordering the list of songs to be played modifying the text to be put on a teleprompter or digitally creating or reordering the story being told in an animation movie or play. Other examples might be a digital animation created in real time to match the response from the observers or a presenter altering his or her presentation i.e. the event being observed in real time to incorporate the feedback from the observers in the audience. Once the event transformer has modified the event the observers see the altered progression of the event . The observers continue to provide feedback via the client forming a feedback loop.

Feedback indicia and feedback results may be provided to an event transformer in real time but in some embodiments it need not be real time. The feedback indicia and results extend over the event timeline and thus can be correlated with particular mileposts objects or characters in an event .

For example consider an event such as a television show with a plurality of participants. At different times within an episode of the show different participants will be shown or not shown and sometimes two or more participants may be shown interacting. Based on observer feedback indicia that are correlated with the timing of the show the event timeline television producers can determine if an observers rating of the show goes up or down when a particular participant is involved and transform the storyline using components of an event transformer . This can also be done for combinations of participants. For example participant A and participant B may not be very popular on their own but may be very popular in their interaction with one another.

This need not only be for participants. For example on a show there might be different routes that can be taken. Observers might be much more engaged with one route than the other.

Another example transformation may be a story or a narrative that has a number of alternate endings. These alternate endings differ from one another in terms of how some characters do relative to other characters and how often some characters appear in these endings relative to other endings. For example given five endings one to five and four characters A B C and D character A may be more prevalent in ending one than all the other characters character B may be more prevalent in ending two then all the other characters character C may be more prevalent or appear more often in ending than all of the other characters and character D may appear more often in ending than any of the other characters. Also the endings may be distinguished from one another based on how characters do. That is character A may be more prevalent in endings one and five than all of the other characters however in ending one character does well while in ending five character A comes to a bad end.

Another example may be in the context of advertising. For example some songs are more popular than other songs. The event transformer may be operable to reorder the songs based on their popularity. In addition system may sell advertising based on the popularity of the songs and also based on demographic information regarding each of the songs. Thus if one song is much more popular than another then an advertiser may pay more to sell advertising in association with that song. On the other hand if one song is more popular with mature females while another song is more popular with adolescent males then different advertisements may be targeted for each these songs.

An interested party is a special case of a beneficiary that is interested in studying and further processing the feedback results and other packaged data received from server system . An interested party uses event related data for a purpose of interest.

A proxy is a special case of a beneficiary. The role of the proxy is to receive feedback results and use some or all of the feedback results as selected by the observer within the limits allowed by the proxy . An example might be that an observer s Facebook page would have a widget embedded application or a plug in that shows their reaction in real time to any event such as for example a TV show currently being watched. A plug in is a set of software components that adds specific capabilities to a larger software application. The proxy can provide feedback results to other interested parties .

An account identifier is a unique identifier for each observer device pairing. Its purpose is to collate stateless asynchronous transmissions to the server system . Similar techniques include cookies and session identifiers. As discussed previously in some embodiments the server system issues a unique observer identifier and an observer record in response to registration of an observer . This enables the observer to use one or more different devices in the future without having to re register the observer device pairing. Likewise this also enables the same device to be used by different observers . In various embodiments issuing of a unique identifier to the observer along with creation of an observer record may enable the server system to suggest events to the observer based on what he has observed evaluated and enjoyed in the past. The unique identifier for each observer may be in the form of a user id password combination.

In some other embodiments the server system issues a unique identifier to the device only. This may allow an observer to observe and evaluate an event even if the observer does not desire to sign up or register to obtain a unique observer identifier. The unique identifier for each device may be based on all or some of the following parameters such as for example device name device model operating system operating system version etc. By issuing a unique identifier for an observer device or both server system can differentiate among various observers during the analysis of received feedback indicia.

In some other embodiments the server system may not generate a unique identifier for an observer device or both in which case the server system may differentiate among different observers based on their GPS information such as for example longitude latitude altitude etc. Other environmental indicia may also be used.

The event identifier is a unique identifier associated with an event record and is used to identify an event. This identifier may be used to collate data across reservations for observing the same event and collate received feedback indicia for the same event and so on. An event identifier is assigned to an event record in order to identify data for the event.

The reservation identifier is a unique identifier issued by the server system for each host event pairing in general. In general a reservation for an event is a reservation that specific feedback indicia will be received for that event. Multiple reservations may be made for one event in order to for example collect different types of feedback indicia for the same event. A host may create multiple reservations for the same event so the reservation identifier may be specifically a unique identification of a host event instance tuple as an example.

The reservation identifier is created in response to a host device registering a reservation for receiving feedback for an event with server system . The reservation identifier is used to inform the observer of the event for which feedback is requested. The reservation identifier is used by the server system to collate all activities for the host s request collate feedback indicia received in relation to the reservation and so on.

An invitation may be an announcement of the host creation of a reservation and assignment of a reservation identifier for use during feedback indicia collection for the event . The invitation may have two manifestations. First the invitation may be a communication between the host and observers announcing the request for feedback on an event .

Second the invitation may be a host specified list of which observers are granted the privilege of providing feedback on an event . In this scenario the reservation identifier or other data describing the reservation may show up on the clients of authorized observers . The public in general may not receive notice if the reservation indicates that it should be private and limited to certain observers .

Device may also include peripheral devices such as printers antenna transceivers speakers camera microphone global positioning system sensors scanners and other input output devices . Applications provide additional services to device and interact with input output devices peripherals and other components of the device .

Reference is now made to which illustrates a block diagram of a client for capturing event feedback in accordance with at least one embodiment In this example embodiment client comprises a transmission module user interface module data processor and metaphor generator module .

Transmission module may be configured to synchronize to an event record stored on a remote computer readable storage module such as server system for example. As described herein the event record represents an event of interest such that transmission of event feedback at the transmission module is configured to link the event feedback to the event record.

User interface module is configured at a plurality of different times during an event timeline to receive the event feedback as feedback indicia associated with the event of interest. These different times may define time segments of approximately equal length alternatively the different times may define time segments that vary widely in length.

Data processor is configured to assemble a feedback indicia array using the feedback indicia. The feedback indicia array stores the plurality of different times and an associated plurality of feedback indicia. For each time in the plurality of different times the feedback indicia array comprises a time indicium pair. The time indicium pair may be referred to as a time indicium pair. The time indicium pair may include a time entry and an indicium associated with that time i.e. the pairing of the time and the associated feedback indicium. An event timeline defines a period of time for the event for that client .

In some embodiments the transmission module is configured during the event timeline to provide the event feedback by periodically transmitting each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array to a remote data processing module such as on server until all of the feedback indicia array is transmitted to the remote data processing module. The transmission of each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array is configured to link the time indicium pair to the event record.

In some embodiments transmission module is configured to synchronize to the event record stored on the remote computer readable storage module such as on server to link the feedback indicia array to the event record by transmitting an event identifier identifying the event record to the remote data processing module.

In some embodiments the transmission module is configured to transmit the event identifier with each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array to the remote data processing module such as on server .

The transmission module may also be configured to synchronize to the event record stored on the remote computer readable storage module to link the feedback indicia array to the event record by transmitting each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array to a location. The location may identify the event record. As mentioned above the term location may mean a physical or virtual location such as an identified resource. For example location may refer to a uniform resource identifier which may be classified as locators names or both.

The user interface module may be configured for the event of interest to receive human feedback indicia. The associated plurality of feedback indicia stored in the feedback indicia array may then also include a plurality of human feedback ratings. A human feedback rating may be provided by a user of the computing device such that for each time in the plurality of different times the feedback indicia array comprises a time human indicium pair comprising that time and an associated human feedback rating in the associated human feedback ratings.

In some embodiments transmission module is during a delayed time interval overlapping with the event timeline configured to receive an aggregate feedback array determined at the remote data processing module. The aggregate feedback array may be determined by aggregating the time indicium pairs transmitted to the remote data processing module with other feedback indicia associated with the event received from other users.

For each time the aggregate feedback array may include a runtime value and an aggregate result pair. The runtime value may be associated with a point in time within the event timeline. The aggregate result may be determined at the remote data processing module from the associated feedback indicium in the time indicium pair for that runtime value.

The transmission module may be configured for each time in the plurality of different times to periodically receive the runtime value and aggregate result pair. In some embodiments the transmission module may be configured for a particular time in the plurality of different times to only receive that runtime value and aggregate result pair when the aggregate result corresponding to that runtime value is not the same as the aggregate result corresponding to an immediately previous runtime value. In other words if the aggregate result for runtime value a and runtime value b are the same where runtime value a comes immediately before runtime value b the transmission module may be configured to not receive one of these runtime value aggregate result pair to avoid duplication. In various embodiments the communication module of the server system is configured to only transmit that runtime value and aggregate result pair when the aggregate result corresponding to that runtime value is not the same as the aggregate result corresponding to an immediately previous runtime value. Duplicate data refers to the same data or aggregate result and may not refer to the same data or aggregate results received at different times or for different runtime values. In other embodiments all data values or aggregate results including duplicates are received and transmitted. Duplication avoidance may occur because of an understanding between the server system and the device that duplicate aggregate results sampled next to each another may not be sent to the device in order to save device power used to receive signals. In such embodiments the device may be configured to assume the same aggregate result over a duration of time until a new runtime value and aggregate result pair is received. In other words the understanding between the server system and the device may be that if no runtime value aggregate result pair is received by the transmission module then no change in the aggregate result for the subsequent runtimes is assumed until a new runtime value aggregate result pair is received. A sequence of runtime value aggregate result pair such as T1 6 T6 3 T 9 7 may be received by the device to mean T1 6 T2 6 T3 6 T4 6 T5 6 T6 3 T7 3 T8 3 T 9 7 . In some other embodiments the understanding between the server system and the device may be that if no runtime value aggregate result pair is received by the transmission module then the aggregate result for the subsequent runtimes is assumed to be null until a new runtime value aggregate result pair is received. In such embodiments a sequence of runtime value aggregate result pair such as T1 6 T6 3 T 9 7 may be received by the device to mean T1 6 T2 null T3 null T4 null T5 null T6 3 T7 null T8 null T 9 7 . In other embodiments all runtime value and aggregate result pairs transmitted from the communication module of the server system are received by the transmission module of the device .

The transmission module may be configured to receive some of the runtime value and aggregate result pairs during the event timeline before transmitting some associated feedback indicia in the associated plurality of feedback indicia to the remote data processing module.

The transmission module may be configured to wirelessly transmit the feedback indicia array to the remote data processing module and wirelessly receive the aggregate feedback array from the remote data processing module.

During the event timeline the client may be configured to progressively display more of the time indicium pairs and the runtime value and aggregate result pairs.

The client may comprise at least one sensor device such as a heart rate sensor a pulse rate sensor a temperature sensor a sound level sensor a light level sensor a GPS location sensor an image sensor an olfactory sensor a speech sensor and so on. The sensor device may be configured at each time in a plurality of different sensor measurement times during the event timeline to measure a sensor feedback value to provide a plurality of sensor feedback values. A sensor feedback value may be one of biometric feedback indicating a biometric characteristic of a user and environmental feedback indicating an environmental condition around the user. In some embodiments sensor devices may also be used to provide human feedback indicia. For example a speech sensor may be used to receive feedback indicia based on an observer speaking to the speech sensor device . In some cases the speech may then be translated into text and the text may be used to send feedback indicia. In another example for events such as marching ice skating or boxing competitions the judges or other individuals may provide feedback indicia by saying sport specific terms or phrases into the sensor device. Some of those terms or phrases may have an impact of providing positive feedback indicia for example by adding points to the event scores. Some of the other terms and phrases may have an impact of providing negative feedback indicia for example by deducting points from the event scores. In yet other embodiments a milepost creator may create mileposts using sensor devices such as for example a speech sensor device. This may be done by a milepost creator speaking into the sensor device terms or phrases that may signify creation of a milepost. For example a milepost creator such as a person may speak into the sensor device a term such as goal to mean that a basketball has gone through the hoop or a hockey puck has gone into the net and accordingly a milepost is created for that goal.

In some embodiments the data processor may be configured to receive the at least one sensor feedback value measured at the sensor device and a corresponding sensor measurement time and assemble a sensor feedback indicia array therefrom. The sensor feedback indicia array stores different sensor measurement times and an associated sensor feedback values such that for each time in the plurality of different sensor measurement times the sensor feedback value may include a sensor measurement time sensor feedback value pair with that time and an associated sensor feedback value in the associated plurality of sensor feedback values. The transmission module may be configured during the event timeline to periodically transmit each sensor measurement time sensor feedback value pair in the sensor feedback indicia array along with each time human indicium pair in the human feedback indicia array to a remote data processing module until all of the sensor feedback indicia array and the human feedback indicia array is transmitted to the remote data processing module.

In some embodiments each sensor measurement time sensor feedback value pair transmitted to the remote data processing module may not be in any particular order with respect to time for instance may not be in an ascending or descending order with respect to time . In other words a pair comprising a sensor measurement time b and a corresponding sensor feedback value may be transmitted before another pair comprising a sensor measurement time a and a corresponding sensor feedback value even if the sensor measurement time b occurs after the sensor measurement time a. Similarly in some other embodiments each time human indicium pair transmitted to the remote data processing module may not be in any particular order with respect to time. In some embodiments and contexts it may be more efficient in terms of data transmission rates to order data transmission in a non timewise manner.

In some embodiments the different sensor measurement times in the sensor feedback indicia array and the different times in the human feedback indicia array may coincide and the transmission module may be configured during the event timeline to periodically transmit each time in the human feedback indicia array and the associated human indicium and sensor feedback value as a three tuple to the remote data processing module. In some other embodiments the transmission module may be configured to send an n tuple including a timestamp and a plurality of human feedback indicia and a plurality of sensor feedback values all corresponding to that timestamp. For example at a given time the plurality of human feedback indicia may include an x position a y position gesture etc. and the plurality of sensor feedback values may include values measured by different sensors such as heart rate sensor a pulse rate sensor or a temperature sensor. This n tuple may be represented as a data structure of the form timestamp human feedback type1 human feedback type2 . . . human feedback typeN sensor feedback type1 sensor feedback type2 . . . sensor feedback typeN where each of the human feedback type1 human feedback type2 . . . human feedback typeN sensor feedback type1 sensor feedback type2 . . . sensor feedback typeN correspond to the same timestamp.

In some embodiments the different sensor measurement times in the sensor feedback indicia array and the different times in the human feedback indicia array may coincide. In some other embodiments the different sensor measurement times in the sensor feedback indicia array and the different times in the human feedback indicia array may not coincide.

In some embodiments each sensor measurement time sensor feedback value pair and each time human indicium pair transmitted to the remote data processing module may be in random order with respect to each other. In other words the transmission module may be configured to transmit a time human indicium pair after transmitting a plurality of sensor measurement time sensor feedback value pairs or vice versa. For example the transmission module may be configured to transmit a time human feedback pair after transmitting time sensor feedback pair and time sensor feedback pair where timeand timecoincide and timeoccurs after time.

The clients may also include a metaphor generator . The metaphor generator may be operable to configure a plurality of metaphors such that each metaphor in the plurality of metaphors is providable at the computing device and usable by the observer to input a variable human feedback rating.

In some embodiments the user interface module may be configured to receive from the user a request for a metaphor in the plurality of metaphors configured by the metaphor generator and to provide the metaphor requested by the user. The user interface module may then receive at a plurality of different times during the event timeline human feedback using the metaphor provided. The data processor may be configured to convert the human feedback received using the metaphor into the human feedback indicia array. Each human feedback indicia array in the associated plurality of human feedback indicia arrays may include a mapping of the human feedback received using the metaphor into a numerical value and each time corresponding to the human feedback in the different times which include the time at which the human feedback was received. The mapping of the human feedback into a numerical value may be based on mapping information provided by the event record representing the event of interest.

The transmission module may be configured to transmit an indication of the metaphor provided at the computing device to receive human feedback from the user to the remote data processing module and receive the aggregate feedback array determined by the remote data processing module. The aggregate feedback array may be determined based on the indication of the metaphor transmitted.

The data processor may be operable to reconfigure the metaphor generator to restrict the plurality of metaphors to a subset of metaphors that include at least one metaphor. The subset of metaphors may be provided at the user interface module for the observer to input the human feedback rating specified by the event record.

The data processing module may be operable to filter out from the unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays any feedback indicia arrays in the unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays not satisfying the at least one feedback source acceptance attribute from the unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays in determining the aggregate feedback result array. The aggregate feedback result array may be determined without considering any feedback indicia arrays filtered out from the unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays.

The communication module may be configured to display characteristics such as location age gender nationality mobile device type and mobile device model to the requester. The communication module may include an input operable by the requester to select the at least one feedback source acceptance attribute from the plurality of characteristics comprising location age gender nationality mobile device type and mobile device model. The feedback source acceptance attribute may comprise a plurality of feedback indicia array sources. Each feedback indicia array source may identify a user or a device . Each feedback indicia array received at the communication module may be received from an associated feedback indicia array source in the plurality of feedback indicia array sources. The data processing module may determine the aggregated feedback result array without considering feedback from a source other than the plurality of feedback indicia array sources. On receiving the request to register the new event from the requester the data processing module may be configured to further define the new event record by receiving from a requester at the communication module and storing in the computer readable storage module at least one authorized feedback indicium kind. The at least one authorized feedback indicia indicium kind may include a rating provided by a user biometric feedback indicating a biometric characteristic of the user and environmental feedback indicating an environmental condition around the user.

The communication module may be configured to receive an unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays. The data processing module may be operable to filter out any feedback indicia arrays in the unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays defining feedback kinds other than the at least one authorized feedback indicium kind. The aggregate feedback result array may be determined without considering any feedback indicia arrays filtered out from the unfiltered plurality of feedback indicia arrays.

The at least one authorized feedback indicium kind may include the human feedback and at least one of environmental feedback and biometric feedback. The feedback indicia arrays received for the new event record is configured to store for each time in the plurality of different times an associated human feedback rating and at least one of an environmental feedback entry and a biometric feedback entry.

The data processing module may be configured to analyze each feedback indicia array in the plurality of feedback indicia arrays received at the communication module to determine a plurality of tentative milepost times in the plurality of different times for that feedback indicia array. The feedback indicium corresponding to each tentative milepost time in the plurality of milepost times may differ from the feedback indicium corresponding to a time immediately before this milepost time by more than a threshold amount. The data processing module may also compare the plurality of tentative milepost times for each feedback indicia array in the plurality of feedback indicia arrays with the plurality of tentative milepost times for other feedback indicia arrays in the plurality of feedback indicia arrays to determine a plurality of confirmed milepost times in the associated aggregate feedback timeline. The aggregate feedback result corresponding to each confirmed milepost time in the plurality of confirmed milepost times differs from the aggregate feedback result corresponding to a time in the plurality of different times for the associated aggregate feedback timeline immediately before this confirmed milepost time by more than an aggregate threshold amount.

In some embodiments for each event record in the plurality of different event records the data processing module may be configured to determine the aggregate feedback result array from the plurality of feedback indicia arrays received for that event record by determining the associated aggregate feedback timeline by converting the plurality of different times for each feedback indicia array in the plurality of feedback indicia arrays to a common timescale along the associated aggregate feedback timeline based on the plurality of tentative milepost times determined for each feedback indicia array.

The data processing module may be further operable to change the threshold amount when determining the aggregate feedback timeline.

The communication module may be configured to receive at least one input tag from a user for each feedback indicia array in at least two feedback indicia arrays in the plurality of feedback indicia arrays. The data processing module is operable to determine for each feedback indicia array in the at least two feedback indicia arrays a user selected timeline segment a start time tag and an end time tag based on the at least one input tag. The user selected timeline segment corresponds to a duration of time of a segment within an event timeline. The start time tag corresponds to a start time of the user selected timeline segment and the end time tag corresponds to an end time of the user selected timeline segment. The at least two feedback indicia arrays may be selected such that the user selected timeline segment of one feedback indicia array in the at least two feedback indicia arrays differs in length from a different feedback indicia array in the at least two feedback indicia arrays. The data processing module may further determine the aggregate feedback result array by defining an associated aggregate feedback timeline by comparing at least two user selected timeline segments for the at least two feedback indicia arrays to determine at least one time scale adjustment and adjusting the relative timing of at least some of the plurality of the feedback indicia arrays based on the at least one time scale adjustment before aggregating the plurality of feedback indicia arrays.

The data processing module may be configured to operate in real time to determine an updateable version of the aggregate feedback result array based in part on a part of a feedback indicia array in the plurality of feedback indicia arrays received from one mobile device before a remainder of that feedback indicia array is received at the communication module. The communication module may be operable to progressively transmit updated versions of the updateable version of the aggregate feedback result array to the one mobile device before all of that feedback indicia array from the one mobile device is received at the communication module.

The computer readable storage module may be operable to store two or more event records for the same event. In some embodiments the server system may register and the computer readable storage module may be operable to store different event records for the same event wherein each event record corresponds to a different aspect of the event . For example different event records may be provided for different groups of users or for the same event viewed from different perspectives.

For the at least one event record in the plurality of event records the computer readable storage module may be configured to store a plurality of feedback indicia array sources. Each feedback indicia array source in the plurality of feedback indicia array sources may identify at least one of a mobile device in the plurality of mobile devices and a user of the mobile device and a location of the mobile device.

The data processing module may be further configured to generate a list of event records in the plurality of event records stored at the computer readable storage module based on the comparison that for each event record in the list of event records at least one feedback indicia array source in the plurality of feedback indicia array sources may identify all that information also identified in the identification information received from the mobile device.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a flowchart diagram of a method for capturing event feedback implemented by server system in accordance with at least one embodiment. Some or all of the method steps may be implemented in near real time.

At step server system registers an event record and assigns an event identifier to the registered event record. The event record is associated with an event and an event timeline where the event timeline defines a period of time for the event. For example the event timeline may have a start and end time and may be divided into time steps or annotated with mileposts. The event record may be used to store data regarding the event including event details feedback indicia for the event and feedback results for the event . An example of an event timeline that is divided into time steps may be for a concert that begins at 8 00 pm ends at 11 00 pm and in which the time steps might be individual songs or some other form of performer audience interaction. The event timeline may be different than the actual time the event is viewed by observers such as if the event is not a live event for example In other examples the event timeline may correspond to the time the event is viewed by observers such as for example if the event is a live event. However even if the event is a live event the event timeline may not correspond to the time the event is viewed by observers . System is operable to compare two performances or views of the same event that are viewed by observers at different times. For example a song in a concert or a live musical may not be performed at the same second at different performances at different times such as on different days. The use of individual songs as time steps on the event timeline or mileposts enables the system to compare different parts of the two performances.

Server system may receive configuration parameters for receiving the feedback indicia and generating and providing feedback results. For example the host may create a reservation for a specific event and in response server system registers an event record if an event record for the event does not already exist. To create reservation for an event the host can 1 specify the computational resources needed for evaluating an event and 2 select options for obtaining and recording feedback indicia from the observers and clients 3 select options for aggregating analyzing and packaging the feedback from the observers and 4 select options for distribution to beneficiaries among other configurations.

The host can 1 register with the server system 2 authenticate to the server system 3 specify the parameters for the event observation e.g. how the server system will aggregate the feedback indicia received from the observers during the event 4 specify the parameters for the analysis of the feedback indicia and 5 specify the parameters for the feedback results. Optionally the host may create a unique observer experience by customizing the appearance using logos graphic displays designs and other industry nuances and the metaphor used on the client to provide feedback to the server system .

The initial registration may be changed. Registration information that is not required before the event begins may be supplied at any time such as for example distribution of feedback results.

The server system is operable to verify or validate the information supplied by the host . This may include event identification metaphors used by the client maximum resource consumption analysis strategies packaging and distribution of the feedback results. The server system then stores information that will be used at the time of the event. If in a cloud environment the server system may also need to reserve computational resource for the time of the event . Not all information is required before the event . Some aspects such as analysis packaging and distribution may be received from the host after the event. Once the server system has sufficient information to make a reservation the host is provided a reservation identifier for the event . This information may be kept in the host s account on the server system .

Optionally to attract observers the host may publicize the registration identifier or invite potential observer to rate an event via the client . Alternatively the host may request the server system to publicize the event and or the Registration Identifier or invite potential observers to rate an event via the client .

Referring now to table 1 interactions between various components of system namely observers clients and server system can be depicted in accordance with one embodiment as below 

Prior to the event the observer may need to install the client on a device . However the client may for example be embedded within another application or webpage. The device then launches the client . For example the observer using a mobile device may select the icon representing the application corresponding to client of system . As discussed above the observer may have to provide the client with a unique observer identifier to be sent to server system . In some other embodiments the unique identifier corresponding to the device on which the client is launched is transmitted to the server system . In some other embodiments a GPS location of the device on which client is launched is transmitted to the server system . In various embodiments a combination of some or all of the above is transmitted to the server system . This enables the server system to differentiate among various observers . In some embodiments the name and version number of the client may be transmitted to the server system so an updated version of the client can be provided to the observer and device . Other identifiers may also be used in other example embodiments.

In various embodiments the server system includes a table for each identifying attribute such as for example device identifier observer identifier GPS location etc. The server system may search a database for the received identifying attribute to determine if the observer the device or both have been identified previously. If so a unique observer identifier corresponding to a table entry in the database may be returned to the observer . If not then the server system may create a new entry corresponding to the received identifying attributes in a table of the database generate a new unique observer identifier and return the observer identifier to the observer for subsequent uses.

To select an event the observer requests from the client a list of registered events. In some embodiments the observer request is triggered when the observer types in a search term or a part of the search term on the device . In various embodiments the server system is operable to find search terms such as titles of actual events matching the keystrokes entered by the observer also known as a type ahead feature . For instance as soon as the observer enters the letter p the server system may be able to send the client a list of registered events starting with letter p or a list of search terms starting with the letter p such as events titled political debate Phantom of the Opera a musical Parenthood a TV show Pro Wrestling a sport etc. In some other embodiments the event list provided to the observer includes events that contain the entered keystrokes not necessarily starting with the entered keystrokes. This allows an event titled The Phantom of the Opera to appear in the event list as well for example. In some other embodiments the server system is operable to provide candidate search terms and not titles of actual events based on the keystrokes entered by the observer . This may be convenient for the user if for example if the list of the titles associated with the input is long as compared to a list of candidate search terms

In some embodiments only those events starting with or containing the entered keystrokes that the observer is permitted to observe and evaluate are displayed. Such a list may include all publically available events but only those private events that the observer is either invited to or permitted to observer. In some other embodiments all registered events starting with or containing the entered keystrokes are displayed. In such a case the private or invitation only events are displayed with an indicator such as a lock or text indicating that the observer is not permitted to observe that event . As the observer enters more keystrokes the automatic display of event list gets filtered and updated. The observer may then either complete typing the search term or chose one of the displayed events.

In some embodiments to select an event to observe the observer requests from the client a list of reservation identifiers or event identifiers that the observer is authorized to see. The observer then selects the appropriate reservation identifier or event identifier. In various embodiments the GPS information or the observer s observer record may filter the event list reservation identifiers or event identifiers displayed to the observer . For example at least some of the events in the event list may be associated with a geographic location. Server system may receive a geographic location of the device and generate the list of the events based on the geographic location of the device . Server system may generate a list of events proximate to the geographic location of the device . As further examples the list of events may be generated based on a geographic location of the event a geographic location of the device the event timeline a current time a list of observers invited to provide feedback for the event whether the event is publically available for feedback prior event selection choices by that observer and so on.

The event list may be displayed in the order of event start times. The event list may also be organized based on the duration of the events . The order of the listing of the events may also be customized based on the options selected by the host device or observer . In some embodiments the listing of the events may be customizable and ordered based on the GPS coordinates of the observer or device . For example if a fast food chain restaurant wants to gather feedback for their restaurant the observer may be able to receive a list of events such as restaurants in the order of geographical proximity to them i.e. the closest restaurant for that fast food chain to appear on the top of the list. The device may receive the location via GPS QR code manual input and so on. The observer may also customize the client to display only a few events on the user interface at a given time. For instance if the event list contains 100 events the client can be customized to only display results at a time. The observer may request the next set of event results to be displayed by either pressing a button scrolling or other means. The observer or host or host device may customize the level of detail associated with an event that is available to the observer . For instance a small description of the events may be made available in the event list. In various embodiments a unique identifier may appear with each event in the event list. This identifier may be the event identifier reservation identifier or a new and unique identifier.

In some embodiments the appearance of the client may be customized based on the options selected by the host device . In some other embodiments the server system may specify one or more metaphors for receiving the feedback indicia such as a slider a question a numerical scale a point within an image a hand gesture a simulated hand gesture an icon a button a graph text a chart a grid a multi touch gesture moving sliding finger tapping rhythmically clapping hands clapping on the internet by for example activation or repeated use of a button or a number of symbols for example. The server system may change the metaphors for receiving the feedback at fixed points in time within the time period for the event. The server system may change the metaphors in response to received feedback indicia.

In various embodiments the observer may send a request for a user interface metaphor to the server system . For instance the observer may want to use a slider or a line as a metaphor. The observer may desire to move a pointer on a line where extreme right may indicate an extreme positive feedback and extreme left may indicate an extreme negative feedback over answering questions another example of a metaphor . In other embodiments questions may be used to gather different information than positions on a slider. The server system may be operable to provide the observer with some information with respect to the requested metaphor such as which direction or action indicates positive feedback etc.

In various embodiments once an event is selected by the observer the server system first determines if the observer is authorized to observe the event . This may be done by prompting the observer to either provide the unique observer identifier discussed above the unique identifier corresponding to each event in the event list or both to the client to be sent to the server system . If the observer is found to be authorized the server system generates a key for the observer . The key may be generated using cryptographic methods such as for example RFC 2014 Hash based Message Authentication Code etc.

Before the observer experiences the event the server system provides the observer with the address of the evaluation location from where the observer may evaluate the event and provide input data. In various embodiments the observer is prompted to provide the key generated by the server system upon authentication of the observer for verification. Once the entered key is verified to be the same as the generated key the observer is permitted to enter the evaluation location to provide feedback. In various embodiments the evaluation location provided to the observer is based on the observer or device GPS location. This may be helpful in regulating online traffic and minimizing latency. In system any individual can host and define what observers are permitted to provide feedback based on type of observer location of observer observer identifier and so on for example. This allows users to create their own network of friends and receive and share their feedback amongst themselves rather than the world at large.

In some embodiments an observer and a host may be the same entities and the client may functionally also include the host client or vice versa. Once an observer launches a client either on a device or through a webpage or by any other means the observer may be able to select an event from a plurality of registered events at the server system and invite a selected group of individuals to provide feedback with respect to the selected event. For instance an observer may be interested in providing feedback for an event such as for example American Idol but may also want to see how his or her friends rate the same event. The selected group of friends may be selected from one s social media accounts such as Facebook Twitter etc. The selected group of friends may also be invited by providing a link in electronic mails where the link may be followed to provide feedback such that the feedback can be linked to the event record of the event selected by the observer in this example American Idol . Accordingly system is operable to link feedback from observers that are friends in order to provide specific results to observers regarding their friends.

The observer experiences the event. An event is an observable phenomenon such as a concert a sporting event an audio program a television program a movie a political event an artistic performance a party a meeting a class a seminar a conference a recorded event a live event or an artistic performance for example.

At step server system receives feedback indicia for the event from observers via a plurality of devices and clients where each feedback indicia is associated with an event timestamp. Each event timestamp indicates a point in time within the event timeline. This enables the feedback data to be correlated to the event timeline in order to process the data and generate feedback results. In some embodiments the feedback indicia may consist of human feedback identifying the reaction of the observer . The human feedback indicia may be received by using metaphors such as sliders or answering questions etc. The human feedback indicia may also be received by electro mechanical means. For example a device may be a flip phone or a slide phone and the reaction of the observer may be recorded based on the number of times the observer flips open or slides the device. Likewise a device may consist of an accelerometer which may detect the shaking of the device as an expression of how excited an observer may be. In some embodiments the client may be operable to convert the electro mechanical indicia or other human feedback indicia received using metaphors to a numerical scale.

In some embodiments the client may be embedded in a webpage where the webpage corresponds to an event record such that feedback with respect to an event may be provided on that webpage and the webpage may automatically link the received feedback to the event record of the event being rated. In some other embodiments the feedback indicia received by a client to be transmitted to the server system which may be configured to link to an event record by transmitting an event identifier identifying an event record to the server system . In some embodiments the event identifier may be transmitted along with each feedback indicia transmitted to the server system .

The feedback indicia received at the client may be transmitted in the form of an array. A two dimensional array may be usable to transmit feedback indicia to the server system where one of the columns of the two dimensional array may consist of timestamps and the second column may consist of a feedback indicium corresponding to each time in the timestamps. In some embodiments each feedback indicium and the corresponding time is transmitted one at a time. In some other embodiments a batch of feedback indicia and the corresponding times are transmitted at once. In yet some other embodiments a buffer may be used at the client to store the feedback indicia along with the corresponding times as they are made available and transmit the feedback indicia and corresponding times as soon as the buffer is either full or has reached a threshold value.

In various embodiments the feedback indicia and the corresponding times may be transmitted before other feedback indicia and the corresponding times are made available at the client . In other embodiments the transmission of the feedback indicia and the corresponding times begins only after all the feedback indicia for an event is made available at the client .

The observer feedback and other environmental or biometric factors may also be transmitted to the server system throughout the event . In some embodiments the device may either be operable to or be coupled to a sensor device that is operable to measure biometric feedback environmental feedback or both. Examples of sensor device may include a heart rate sensor a pulse rate sensor a temperature sensor a sound level sensor a light level sensor a GPS location sensor an image sensor and an olfactory sensor etc.

In some embodiments the human feedback biometric feedback and the environmental feedback may be transmitted by the client to the server system as a four dimensional array consisting of four different columns timestamps human feedback corresponding to various times in the timestamps biometric feedback corresponding to various times in the timestamps and environmental feedback corresponding to various times in the timestamps. In some embodiments there may be a corresponding human feedback biometric feedback and environmental feedback for each time in the timestamps column.

In some other embodiment the human feedback environmental feedback and biometric feedback may not be grouped together into one array. Instead three different arrays may be transmitted where each array consists of two columns with one column being time and the other column being one of the human feedback biometric feedback or environmental feedback.

In some other embodiments only human feedback and one of the biometric feedback or environmental feedback may be transmitted to the server system . In some embodiments the transmission to the server system may be as a three dimensional array consisting of time as one column and human feedback and one of environmental feedback or biometric feedback as the other two columns such that the each time has a corresponding human feedback and one of environmental or biometric feedback. In some other embodiments the transmission to the server system as a three dimensional array may consist of time as one column and human feedback and one of environmental or biometric feedback as the other two columns such that each time in the time column may not necessarily have both corresponding entries that is may not necessarily have both a corresponding human feedback and one of corresponding environmental or biometric feedback . In some other embodiments the transmission to the server system may be as two separate arrays where one array consists of time and corresponding human feedback and the other array consists of time and one of corresponding environmental or biometric feedback.

In some embodiments the server system may use the received feedback to provide an indication of event enjoyment or an indication of engagement. Engagement may not be the same thing as rating enjoyment. Rating measures how much observers viewing the event enjoy it. On the other hand engagement indicates whether observers are presently providing feedback indicia. If they are not providing feedback indicia or if the feedback indicia they are providing does not change over time this can be taken to imply that they are disengaged which presumably is something that event producers do not like. The feedback results may include an evaluation of engagement. The feedback indicia may be in discrete or continuous form. An example of continuous feedback indicia is moving a slider to different positions throughout the event where different positions correspond to different rating measurements. Another discrete form example may be that an observer could select one of five or six different categories of feedback indicia.

For example an observer may operate a metaphor such as a slider to record their level of enjoyment of the event. The observer could also move the slider over time to reflect changes in their enjoyment level. At some points during the event some of the observers may become disengaged and will no longer provide feedback such that either no new feedback indicia is received or the level of enjoyment will stay constant over time. In such cases the server system may determine that at least some of these observers have become disengaged from the event . Alternatively at some point during the event observers may become re engaged and start to operate their slider to indicate changes in their level of enjoyment. This too could be recorded by server system .

In some embodiments the server system may be operable to determine the aggregate feedback results based on the metaphor selected by the observer .

Server system may also receive one or more feedback timestamps for at the least some of the received feedback indicia for the event. The feedback timestamp indicates a time that the respective feedback indicia were received. If the event is a live event then the feedback timestamp may be the same as or proximate to the event timestamp.

In some embodiments the server system may provide feedback results back to the client as soon as they are available so that the observer can assess and provide feedback based on the feedback results and so on. In such embodiments client can simultaneously send observer feedback indicia observer assessment of feedback results and time such as for example feedback timestamps to the server system for analysis.

Some of received feedback indicia for the event may include environmental indicia such as date time longitude latitude altitude acceleration sound levels light levels colors images videos temperature smell images videos air pressure humidity and so on for example. Some of received feedback indicia for the event may include biometric indicia such as heart rate fingerprint images and so on. At least some feedback values for the event may be computed based on the received environmental indicia and biometric indicia for the event.

At step server system stores and validates the received feedback indicia for the event in association with the event record. The server system may also reformat the feedback for efficient recall. Server system may validate the received feedback by checking its format to ensure that the same observer is not submitting feedback indicia multiple times using different devices and so on for example. Other validations may also be implemented.

In various embodiments the server system comprises a front end server a queue for each event and a back end server. The front end server may be operable to receive a request from an observer to provide feedback regarding an event and to return confirmation to the observer in response to the request. Confirmation may be expressed by returning some or all of the following event list voter identifier identifier associated with each event in an event list evaluation location address evaluation location key requested metaphor metaphor associated information etc. The front end server may also be operable to put the observer request into a queue for deferred processing. In such a case a confirmation of receipt of observer request may be provided to the client .

In some embodiments the observer is not notified of a request that did not pass authentication. This may be helpful to prevent hackers or unauthenticated observers from being notified that their exploit was not successful and enticed to try again.

In various embodiments a front end server is also operable to receive feedback indicia along with other information from clients and add them in a queue. The front end server may be operable to notify the client that the transmission of feedback indicia was received correctly.

The front end server may also be operable to receive a request to receive feedback regarding an event from one or more of observers clients hosts host clients beneficiaries including interested parties and proxies event transformers milepost creators and other third parties and to return aggregated analyzed feedback data to the requesting party.

The server system may contain a queue unique to each event that may be required to differentiate processing of information based on priority such as to differentiate high priority back end processing from low priority back end processing. A queue may be required to store observer request to provide feedback regarding an event observer or other party requests to receive feedback regarding an event and feedback indicia and other information received from the observer regarding an event. In various embodiments once a request to provide feedback is put into a queue a queue item identifier may be returned from the queue. This may help server system to detect and prevent duplicate processing. The storage time of a queue may be customized to last any duration of time with or without a possibility of extension. For instance in some cases the storage may be up to 4 days with a possibility of extension up to 12 days.

The back end server of the server system may be operable to retrieve observer request to provide feedback regarding an event from the queue and process it. In various embodiments the back end is tasked with authentication of the observer . If the observer cannot be authenticated the back end server may discard the observer request to observe an event . This may be done by putting the request into a discard queue which may be later analyzed for fraud detection.

The back end server of the server system may also be operable to retrieve feedback indicia including observer input environmental indicia biometric indicia etc. and other information including timestamps observer assessment of feedback results etc. from the queue to be processed.

In various embodiments there are separate databases or tables for each event . This may avoid interference of feedback indicia from an old event with a new event . The feedback indicia and other information retrieved by the back end server for processing may be stored in the database for future reference. The feedback results generated by the back end server of the server system may also be stored in the corresponding databases or tables. The server system may archive the database or table once the data for the event is no longer needed.

The back end server of the server system may also be operable to retrieve requests to receive feedback regarding an event from the queue and send a query to the databases or tables where feedback results are stored. The feedback results may be formatted by the back end server and then returned to the requesting party by the front end server. The back end server may also store the formatted response in the corresponding table or database for future use.

As discussed previously the server system may register devices and assign a device identifier to each registered device . At least some of the received feedback indicia are associated with one or more device identifiers to indicate which device the feedback indicia were received from. Server system may register an event observer and assign an event observer identifier to each registered event observer. The received feedback indicia may then be associated with the event observer identifier to indicate which observer the feedback indicia were received from.

Server system may receive feedback indicia for the event by providing a list of events to a device . Each event identified in the list of events is associated with a unique identifier. Server system may receive a selected event identified in the list of events from the device and associate the received feedback indicia with the unique identifier associated with each event in the list of events. This unique identifier may be the event identifier reservation identifier or a new and unique identifier.

The feedback results may include a method used to receive the feedback indicia a number of observers that feedback indicia is received from a number of devices that feedback indicia is received from a length of time that the feedback indicia was received geographic locations for the plurality of the devices geographic locations of observers that feedback indicia was received from a list of types of feedback indicia received a statistical analysis of the received feedback indicia in view of the event timeline a comparison of feedback indicia received from a first set of observers to feedback indicia received from a second set of observers a list of biases detected during the event reports a web service and raw data in export formats. The server system is operable to receive feedback indicia as input and perform processing steps on the received input to produce feedback results. Further server system is operable to perform analysis on feedback results to generate further feedback results.

The feedback results comprise a vector of feedback result values for the event where each feedback result value is associated with a point in time within the event timeline. Each feedback result value for the event is computed by aggregating the received feedback indicia for the event based on their associated event timestamps. For example for a given time defined by a timestamp server system is operable to aggregate all feedback indicia associated with that timestamp and event to compute an overall feedback result value for the time on the event timeline the feedback result value corresponds to. Server system may generate the feedback results by removing statistical noise from the received feedback indicia. That is the vector of feedback result values provides a mapping of feedback results values to points of time in the event timeline. The points of time may be mileposts for example.

For example the results may include an engagement measurement wherein the engagement measurement indicates the quality and quantity such as frequency of interaction with client of the received feedback indicia at different points in time in the event timeline. As another example server system determines the number of event observers that feedback indicium for the event is received from.

In various embodiments the generation of feedback results is an ongoing and cumulative process. In cases where the event being observed and analyzed is pre recorded observers providing feedback indicia may not be providing such feedback at the same time. For example if an event is a video on the internet for instance on YouTube the feedback may not be provided by all observers at the same time. Therefore the server system is operable to update the feedback results anytime new feedback indicium from an observer is provided.

At least some feedback indicia for the event may be associated with a first observer and at least some other feedback indicia for the event is associated with a group of other observers . The feedback results may include a comparison of the at least some feedback indicia for the event associated with the first observer to the at least some other feedback indicia for the event associated with the one or more other observers .

In some embodiments an observer may be able to choose one or more other observers to compare feedback indicia with. In other words an observer may be able to define and select his own set of audience in order for the server system to generate feedback results that include a comparison of the feedback indicia of the first observer to feedback indicia of the selected audience. For instance an observer may want to compare his feedback indicia to the feedback indicia of other observers of same location age gender etc.

In some embodiments the host may register with the event record a list of characteristics such as for example location age gender nationality mobile device type and mobile device model. In some other embodiments the list of characteristics may include source information identifying a user or an observer . The server system may be operable to use such characteristic and source information to either determine aggregate feedback results or segregate feedback results accordingly. In other words the server system may filter out those feedback indicia that do not satisfy the characteristic or source requirements of the event record while determining an aggregate feedback result array.

In some embodiments the received feedback indicia for the event may be associated with an observer and the feedback results may be specific to the observer by aggregating the received feedback indicia for the event associated with the observer .

In some embodiments an observer may be able to create a unique account on the server system which may or may not be password protected. Observer with the account may allow the server system to display the observer feedback results to one or more other observers . The observer with the account may determine the qualifications of the one or more other observers. For instance the one or more other observers may be limited only to those who are friends of observer with the account. One or more other observers may also elect to follow the observer with the account. By following the observer with the account one or more other observers or followers may be able to receive automatic updates of feedback results of any future events observed and evaluated by observer .

As an example feedback results may compare an observer s own feedback indicia with the feedback of others who had previously or at the same time watched the event. This might work differently in real time and with historical events.

In the real time case observer may track their own enjoyment of the event. Thus in a graph representing feedback results their own trajectory would be going up and down up to the present moment. At the same time the device might provide an aggregate trajectory which would not go up to the present moment as some processing would be involved but could comprise earlier times in the event. Thus the observer could track their relative enjoyment or lack of enjoyment of an event.

In the historical example where the observer is watching an event that other observers have already rated the feedback results may be completely up to date. The device and client may provide a user interface or user display which shows both the observer s feedback results and the aggregate feedback results or alternatively just shows the difference between the observer s feedback results and the aggregate feedback results.

In some other embodiments the system may have celebrity accounts at the server system . A celebrity may be a national or an international person or entity who may have achieved some degree of frame among the masses. In some embodiments the observers may be able to view and or receive feedback as provided by the celebrities. In some other embodiments the observers may also be able to purchase a view of the celebrity feedback indicia or results at any time in the future. In yet some other embodiments the observers may be able to request an overlay of the celebrity feedback indicia over the observer s own feedback indicia. The observer may also request the overlay of feedback indicia from a selected number of individuals such as the observer s Facebook friends observer s own feedback and feedback from one or more celebrities or any other combination of these.

The system may maintain agreements or contracts with celebrities such that celebrities receive a certain amount of money or a share of profits depending on how many events they provide feedback for. For instance it may be a 5 share of the profits if a celebrity provides feedback for one event but the share may go up to 7 if feedback is provided for two events.

The system may maintain a list of subscribers who may be interested in purchasing feedback provided by celebrities. The system may provide for various subscribers to enter into an agreement or contract where they pay a certain amount of money to receive feedback from a celebrity. The purchase price may vary depending on the number of celebrities a subscriber is interested in viewing feedback results from. The purchase price may further vary if a subscriber wants to view an overlay of celebrity feedback results over his own feedback results.

In various embodiments an observer may send a request to the server system to receive feedback results at any time. It is not mandatory for the observer to receive feedback results as soon as they are generated at the server system . The observer may be able to access the feedback results the next day of the event or a month therefrom or till any time depending on storage capabilities of the server system .

At step server system provides a representation of the feedback results. As noted herein a representation may be a chart graph table or other representation of the feedback results in a wide variety of formats depending on the beneficiary or device for example.

In some embodiments client sends a request to the server system to receive feedback results. In some other embodiments client automatically receives feedback results from the server system as soon as they are available. In those embodiments where the client sends a request for feedback one or more of unique identifiers such as for example observer identifier device identifier voter identifier etc. may have to be provided to the client to be transmitted to the server system . The front end of the server system may be operable to search the database and return aggregated and analyzed feedback results to the client .

The individual observer data including feedback results specific to the observer along with the aggregated data including feedback results from all observers may be sent to clients from the server system as specified by the host device . The client receives the data and provides a representation of the data as specified by the host device to the device s for viewing or storing by the observer .

The server system may also provide a representation of the feedback results to one or more beneficiaries . Depending on the default parameters or the parameters specified by the host device this may include but not be limited to all the feedback indicia captured from observers or selected and processed feedback results as it applies only to that particular beneficiary or beneficiaries .

A type of beneficiary is an event transformer . An event transformer may receive feedback results from the server system and then analyze and transform the feedback results into data that is used to affect the progression of the event .

Another type of beneficiary is a proxy . The feedback results received by a proxy may be forwarded to other Interested Parties .

A milepost creator is operable to create the mileposts before during or after the event by making references to activities feedback indicia and feedback results that occur at specific points in event time line. The milepost creator may provide additional data about the activities that may along with the mileposts be included as part of the analysis packaging and distribution of the information to the beneficiaries .

The event timeline and mileposts associated therewith may be created and packaged and transferred to the server system . The server system may correlate the mileposts in the event timeline with observers data and transmit this analysis to beneficiaries .

Reference is now made to which illustrates a flowchart diagram of a method for capturing event feedback implemented by client in accordance with at least one embodiment.

At step client associates an event with an event identifier and an event timeline that defines a period of time for the event . For example client may receive an electronic invitation for event feedback at the device wherein the electronic invitation configures the device to receive and provide the feedback indicia for the event . As another example the client may receive a list identifying events at the device where each event identified in the list is associated with an event identifier or reservation identifier. The client may receive a selected event identified in the list. The client may receive feedback indicia for the selected event at the device and associate the received feedback indicia with the event identifier associated with the selected event .

At least some of the events identified in the list may be associated with a geographic location. The client may determine a geographic location of the device provide the geographic location of the device and receive the list identifying the events based on the geographic location of the device . At least some of the events identified in the list of events are associated with a geographic location proximate to the geographic location of the device .

At step client receives a plurality of feedback indicia for the event at a device . Each feedback indicia is associated with a timestamp and each timestamp indicates a point in time within the event timeline. The device may receive input data such as a keystroke that corresponds to a measurement value and provide the input data to the client for conversion into input data.

The event timeline defines a collection of mileposts where each milepost is a reference to a point in time within the event timeline. The received feedback indicia may be associated with one or more mileposts such that the feedback indicia provide a measurement of the milepost of the event .

Examples types of feedback indicia include human feedback environmental feedback biometric feedback and electro mechanical feedback. Examples of human feedback include a value corresponding to a rating metric activation or repeated use of a button movement of a slider bar clapping hands and so on. Examples of biometric feedback include heart rate DNA fingerprint data voice data iris recognition and so on. Environment feedback is also referred to herein as environmental indicia.

The client may also receive environmental indicia captured by device such as date time longitude latitude altitude sound levels light levels colors images videos temperature smell acceleration video images humidity air pressure and wherein at least some feedback values for the event are computed based on the received environmental indicia for the event .

At step client validates and provides the received feedback indicia for the event to server system . The client may register the device and assigning a device identifier to the registered device and provide the received feedback indicia for the event to server system in association with the device identifier. Examples of validation include checking the format of the feedback indicia and checking completeness of the feedback indicia.

At step client receives feedback results for the event . As described herein the feedback results comprise a vector of feedback result values for the event where each feedback result value is associated with a point in time within the event timeline. Each feedback result value for the event is computed by aggregating received feedback indicia for the event based on their associated timestamps. For example all feedback indicia associated with the same timestamp or proximate timestamps may be correlated

At step client provides a representation of the feedback results. For example client may display a representation of the feedback results on display or output a representation of the feedback results using peripherals or I O devices . In some embodiments the client may be operable to create a representation of the feedback results. The client may receive feedback results from the server system as a table of data stream or block of data and may be operable to create a representation such as for example a graph chart image of the feedback results. The client may also be operable to generate feedback results and then create and provide a representation thereof.

For example the event may be a movie. The literary device of dynamic story lines could be expanded to movies where the observers through its feedback could influence which story line is chosen as the movie progresses. Some movies have multiple story lines weaved through the movie. If the observer feedback shows that a particular storyline is not of interest the digital movie would be altered to attenuate the storyline. This is applicable to TV shows radio programs online media and any other capable media. TV shows that depend on character development for story continuity can glean detailed feedback indicia and feedback results to change a characters role i.e. a main character is leaving for another town but observers want him to stay yields as a better storyline.

The event may also be an award show. Live events like award shows can be custom tailored based on reactions from observers i.e. criticisms of the hosts. The show s producer an example beneficiary would be able to determine on the fly if changes are needed to alter the event to accommodate current feedback.

Another example event may be reality shows. Reality show producers could use the feedback provided by observers during a live production to influence the show. More detailed scoring allows for changes in following weeks. For example on a talent singing show the observer feedback indicia may indicate that group songs are not as popular as single songs or that Beatles songs are more appreciated than Jazz.

An event may be a political debate. Moment by moment feedback indicia from observers during political speeches enable politicians to determine the perception from most favorable to most unfavorable of each statement answer or position taken during the speech. Additionally the questions asked by the moderator could be evaluated by feedback indicia for his her effectiveness.

Another example is education and business. A meeting organizer where the meeting could be a class seminar conference trade show focus group or business meeting can receive feedback indicia from observers in the audience in response to questions asked from the presenter. The feedback results may be displayed immediately in the presenter s charts. Additionally the effectiveness of presenters can be evaluated moment by moment for immediate or future use.

Another example event is sporting events and artistic performances. Part of the fun of attending a sporting event or performance is the roar of the crowd . This aspect is missing when viewing the event remotely. Embodiments can break the feedback data down geography and bring together the virtual crowd . This adds enjoyment to the game or performance and makes the fan reaction interactive among fans observers . Boxing is the only sport where the score and results are not known until the end of the bout. Additionally there is often a lack of understanding supporting the judges scorecards. Embodiments described herein can be used to announce a fan s score round by round. The same logic can be associated with the Olympics and other tournaments where embodiments can be used to judge figure skating and gymnastics.

An event may involve theater. On Broadway understudies are used to fill in when the main actors are unable to perform. The embodiments described herein can help producers and directors evaluate the performance of the understudy by seeing the audience feedback for moments where the understudy performed and compare it to the moments where the regular actor performed. The understudy may be more crowd pleasing than the regular actor.

Environment indicia can be captured from a mobile device including longitude latitude. With these indicia server system is able to discern whether the position of the observer matters in the enjoyment of the event . It could be as small as the different locations in a theater or stadium or as large as global differences. For a worldwide event altitude and longitude will allow feedback indicia and feedback results to be aggregated by country. For a national event it will allow data analysis by state or zip code.

Altitude may be environmental indicia. Similarly to longitude and latitude altitude could be used to discern whether the position of the observer matters in the enjoyment of the event . For example in the case of a rock concert being played in a stadium the server system could figure out if the feedback from observers in the bleachers was better or worse than those at ground level.

Another example is sound levels. If the event was being watched simultaneously in multiple locations e.g. a football game being watched from sport bars around the country the feedback indicia could consist of how loud the crowd reaction were to the event .

Environmental indicia may also include acceleration. Instead of sliding a finger on a device users could shake the device and the intensity of the movement would be interpreted by the three axis gyroscope paired with the accelerometer to convert device movement and convert the data to a 1 10 scale the harder you shake your device the more you like the rock concert you re watching. Note that this is very specific to device but other mobile devices may also be used.

Another example is colors and light levels. Studies show that certain colors have psychological effect. Pink calm prison inmates. Restaurants use orange because it makes people hungrier. With recurring events producers can try different color combinations to see what gives the desired emotional response as audience feedback. The camera on the device detects the predominant colors and sends this information with the observer feedback. The analysis of the aggregated feedback data compared to historical feedback data can tease out the effect of color on the performance.

A further example is heart or pulse rate. Embodiments described herein could be used to help people improve their training. For example a cyclist observer could wear a heart rate monitor and register his her heart rate at various points in time during a circuit repeated over multiple days. Using the feedback data e.g. maximum minimum and average heart rate at various points during the circuit the athlete could improve training. Alternatively if all participants in a race were connected the participants could see how they are doing compared to others or spectators could see how their favorite athlete is doing compared to the field. Additionally server system and client could be used at a theme park to score or provide feedback on various rides like a roller coaster. The increase in pulse rate may be compared to other riders on that run as well as all riders that day month etc. and displayed at the entrance. Can be used across the country for a best in the nation rated ride. Finally using biomedical feedback successes and declines for patients undergoing physical therapy sessions can be monitored more effectively in the home using a smartphone or similar device . Portability without additional expense to the patients.

Images and videos may also be used as feedback indicia and feedback results. People often attend events not only for the event itself but also for the roar of the crowd . Images and video may provide a clue to the reaction of the crowd as a whole. Are they standing up Are they stone still Are they constantly in motion Images provide this information. Another use of images would be to have the device simply capture an image of the observer s facial expressions. Software exists to distinguished different facial expressions. These expressions could then be quantified and returned as feedback indicia.

Temperature may also be environmental indicia. During an outdoors event such as golf tournaments organizers could determine if increase decrease in temperatures has an impact of enjoyment of the event . Air pressure is a further example. An event may have a large sound component. Air pressure affects sound. By detecting the air pressure at the event the results may be able to determine that the air pressure affected the audience feedback. This information is useful to audio engineers who can compensate for this. Humidity is another example. Using server system a movie theater may detect that a particular audience observers did not enjoy a performance as much as other audiences. One of the environmental indicia or factors under the control of the theater owner is the humidity. Should it be determined that the humidity level was the only significant variable then the movie theatre operator can adjust the humidity levels in response to feedback indicia.

Reference is now made to illustrating system in accordance with some embodiments.

As illustrated in whenever an event is checked the reports table is automatically updated with all reports requested at event registration time. Further reports may be selected by the account holder for more money. Once a list of events and corresponding reports are provided to the account holder he way download all the reports requested previously. The reports may be downloaded as a .zip file and may be saved locally.

An online registration account in Votini may allow an individual to switch back and forth between different tabs titled Free or Fee Describe Participation Data Capture View Analyze Cost and Checkout. This may be one web page with multi tabbed navigation. One purpose of the web page design may be to allow the logged in user to create a new event reservation review an existing reservation or change an existing reservation. are supposed to illustrate the logical progression of setting up the options for event reservation by a user. illustrates the provision of data analysis options to the account holder. An account holder registering an event may be able to select one or more types of analysis using Analyze tab that may be carried out on the received feedback data. Some examples of available analysis types include summary rolling average cumulation and raw data in .csv format. By selecting certain analysis types the account holder registering events may become eligible for receiving corresponding reports.

As illustrated in the account holder may be able to checkout and confirm his purchase using Checkout tab . The system may use a payment gateway to receive and authorize payments. illustrates the cost that may be incurred by an account holder who registers an event. The cost may depend on the maximum number of votes set by the account holder the number of days for which the feedback data is made available the metaphor selected to provide to the observer the types and number of available views and the types of feedback data analysis selected.

The webpage titled Data may be accessed by an account holder to input more details while reserving an event as illustrated in . Reservation of an event may prompt the account holder to control the maximum number of votes that can be received from the observers and the frequency of the votes from each observer per minute. The account holder registering an event may also be able to decide for how long the feedback data will be made available. Once an account holder enters certain values for the maximum number of votes to accept and the frequency of votes from each observer per minute the system may be able to generate how many voters the system can support at 100 utilization. For instance if an account holder chooses to receive 30 votes per minute for an event with duration of 90 minutes the system calculates the total number of votes per person to be 2700. If the account holder sets the maximum number of votes to be 300000 the system calculates the capacity of the system to support 111 voters at 100 utilization. The number of voters supported by the system is inversely proportional to the utilization of the system . If the utilization is less than 100 more voters can be supported. The account holder may either reset or save the settings for future use. This tab along with other tabs such as Capture View and Analysis may also be used to provide an educated guess on how much of the system utilization will be needed by the logged in user ahead of actual use.

The describe tab as illustrated in may describe the event selected for registration. The description may include the event identifier the event name the start and end date and time of the event a brief description of the event and a tweet regarding the event. illustrates the provision of allowing a registration account holder to preview the details with HTML.

The fee service may include the following features pay only for votes cost flexible voting periods customizable client metaphors various forms of feedback results and access to raw data. The free service may include the following viewing but not modifying of Participation Data Capture View Analyze Payment or Checkout options. The free service may have limitations as well such as maximum free events per user may be 100 maximum length of allowed events under the free service may be 1 hour maximum votes per event may only be 100 000 data may only be kept for 1 month only introductory client metaphors may be available but not customizable and only introductory feedback results may be returned.

As illustrated in the registration account creator may be able to select the availability of the event. For instance the event may be marked as public which makes it available to everybody and available under all event search results the event may be marked as hidden which makes the event only available to anybody who knows the event identifier as a hidden event does not show up in search results and the event may be marked as private which makes is only visible to authorized logged in users. The participation information as illustrated in controls who is authorized to participate in providing feedback for the event. In some embodiments the availability of events may be controlled by providing a list of authorized users specified by the user making the reservation. The user creating the reservation may specify the authorized users by providing their email addresses recognizable by the system for example. The system may also be operable to notify each member in the list of authorized users of the invitation to provide feedback. In this embodiment only those users who are logged in and on the authorized user list will be able to see the event in the list of available events.

Referring now to there is shown a method of capturing event feedback in accordance with example embodiments.

At step method involves configuring a transmission module of the computing device to synchronize to an event record stored on a remote computer readable storage module . The event record represents an event of interest such that the transmission of the event feedback is configured to link the event feedback to the event record.

At different times during an event timeline at step method involves receiving the event feedback as feedback indicia associated with an event of interest at the computing device . For example device may push the data to or poll the data from the server and the server may poll the data from or push the data to the client .

At step method involves operating a data processor of the computing device to assemble a feedback indicia array using the feedback indicia. The feedback indicia array may store the plurality of different times and an associated plurality of feedback indicia such that for each time in the plurality of different times the feedback indicia array comprises a time indicium pair comprising that time and an associated feedback indicium in the associated plurality of feedback indicia. The event timeline defines a period of time for the event for that computing device.

At step method involves providing the event feedback by during the event timeline by periodically operating a transmission module of the computing device to transmit each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array to a remote data processing module until all of the feedback indicia array is transmitted to the remote data processing module . The transmission of each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array is configured to link the time indicium pair to the event record.

In some embodiments method may involve configuring the transmission module of the computing device to synchronize to the event record stored on the remote computer readable storage module to link the feedback indicia array to the event record by operating the transmission module to transmit an event identifier identifying the event record to the remote data processing module.

In some embodiments method may involve operating the transmission module to transmit an event identifier identifying the event record to the remote data processing module by transmitting the event identifier with each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array. For example this may involve establishing a session between the client and server and only passing the event identifier once and relying on the session state to maintain the relationship between the feedback sent and the event that it was sent for. In other words the event identifier may be sent once for a session and as long as the session is active the assumption is that the event is the same. This is merely an example and other variations may be implemented.

In some embodiments method may involve configuring the transmission module of the computing device to synchronize to the event record stored on the remote computer readable storage module to link the feedback indicia array to the event record comprises operating the transmission module to transmit each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array to a location which may identify the event record.

In some embodiments an event identifier may be provided as part of a URL used to POST the JSON. That is to say the event identifier may not be in the feedback array or the location but may be a parameter on the URL that goes to a location. For example a URL may be of the form protocol location porUcontext view action parameter 1 value 1 parameter 2 value2 . . . where the event identifier could be passed as a parameter N value N . The metadata placed on the URL event parameter event id may provide the link between the event identifier and the feedback in the JSON.

In other embodiments other ways of sending feedback directly on the URL may be used. For example safe methods such as HTTP GET method and HTTP POST may be used. In another embodiment industry substandard URLs such as http example.com view action event 12345 time 238904589 indicium1 6 indicium2 0. 35 . . . may be used. In other embodiments idempotent methods may also be used for sending indicium to the server . In some embodiments transmitting each time indicium pair in the feedback indicia array to a location based on the event identifier comprises transmitting each time indicium pair to a URL uniquely identifying that event. In some embodiments the location does not mean a distinct server but rather a distinct URL.

In some embodiments the feedback indicia for the event of interest received at the computing device may include human feedback. The feedback indicia stored in the feedback indicia array may then include human feedback ratings where each human feedback rating is provided by a user of the computing device and a time human indicium pair of a time and the associated human feedback rating. In some embodiments human feedback may not be received for each time in the event timeline.

In some embodiments at step during a delayed time interval overlapping with the event timeline the method may involve receiving at the transmission module an aggregate feedback array determined by the remote data processing module . The aggregate feedback array may be determined by aggregating the time indicium pairs transmitted to the remote data processing module with other feedback indicia associated with the event received from other users. This may include feedback received at different time segments in the timeline for example.

The aggregate feedback array may include a runtime value and an aggregate result pair the runtime value may be associated with a point in time within the event timeline and the aggregate result being determined from the associated feedback indicium in the time indicium pair for that runtime value. This may not be for each time but some times for example.

In some embodiments method may involve receiving the aggregate feedback array at the transmission module by periodically receiving for each time in of the different times the runtime value and aggregate result pair.

In some embodiments some of the runtime value and aggregate result pairs are received at the transmission module during the event timeline and before some associated feedback indicia in the associated plurality of feedback indicia are transmitted by the transmission module to the remote data processing module.

In some embodiments method may involve operating a display of the computing device to display progressively more of the time indicium pairs and the runtime value and aggregate result pairs during the event timeline.

The computing device is coupled to at least one sensor device such as a heart rate sensor a pulse rate sensor a temperature sensor a sound level sensor a light level sensor a GPS location sensor an image sensor and an olfactory sensor. The sensor device may measure a sensor feedback value such as biometric feedback indicating a biometric characteristic of a user and environmental feedback indicating an environmental condition around the user. In some embodiments method may involve at each time in a plurality of different sensor measurement times during the event timeline measuring the one or more sensor devices for the sensor feedback value to provide sensor feedback values.

In some embodiments method may involve receiving at the computing device the sensor feedback value measured at the sensor device and a corresponding sensor measurement time and assembling a sensor feedback indicia array therefrom. The sensor feedback indicia array stores a plurality of different sensor measurement times and an associated plurality of sensor feedback values such that for each time in the plurality of different sensor measurement times the sensor feedback value comprises a sensor measurement time sensor feedback value pair comprising that time and an associated sensor feedback value in the associated plurality of sensor feedback values. In some embodiments method may involve during the event timeline periodically operating the transmission module of the computing device to transmit each sensor measurement time and sensor feedback value pair in the sensor feedback indicia array along with each time human indicium pair in the human feedback indicia array to a remote data processing module until all of the sensor feedback indicia array and the human feedback indicia array is transmitted to the remote data processing module.

In some embodiments method may involve operating a metaphor generator at the computing device the metaphor generator being operable to configure a plurality of metaphors such that each metaphor in the plurality of metaphors is providable at the computing device and usable by the observer to input a variable human feedback rating.

In some embodiments method may involve receiving from the user a request for a metaphor in the plurality of metaphors configured by the metaphor generator and providing at the computing device the metaphor requested by the user. The device may be configured to interpret and convert received feedback data prior to sending the data to the server and may also be configured to send raw feedback data directly to the server.

At a plurality of different times during the event timeline the method may involve receiving human feedback using the metaphor provided at the computing device converting the human feedback received using the metaphor into the human feedback indicia array. The plurality of different times may not necessarily mean all of the times in the event timeline. Put another way even if feedback results are typically sampled at a certain frequency or period there may be periods much longer than the usual period during which the feedback results are not sampled. Each human feedback indicia array in the associated plurality of human feedback indicia arrays may include a mapping of the human feedback received using the metaphor into a numerical value. Each time corresponding to the human feedback in the plurality of different times may include the time at which the human feedback was received. The mapping of the human feedback into a numerical value is based on mapping information provided by the event record representing the event of interest.

In some embodiments method may involve transmitting at the transmission module an indication of the metaphor provided at the computing device to receive human feedback from the user to the remote data processing module . The method may further involve receiving at the transmission module the aggregate feedback array determined by the remote data processing module . The aggregate feedback array is determined based on the indication of the metaphor transmitted.

In some embodiments method may involve operating the data processor at the computing device to reconfigure the metaphor generator to restrict the plurality of metaphors to a subset of metaphors. The subset of metaphors may include at least one metaphor wherein the subset of metaphors to be provided at the computing device for the observer to input the human feedback rating is specified by the event record. Receiving from the user a request for a metaphor in the plurality of metaphors comprises receiving from the user a request for a metaphor in the subset of metaphors.

Referring now to there is shown a method of capturing feedback in accordance with other example embodiments.

At step the method involves on a computer readable storage module storing different event records for different events such that there may be an event record for each event.

At step the method involves for each event record receiving a plurality of feedback indicia arrays at a communication module the communication module being electronically linked to the computer readable storage module for communication therewith.
