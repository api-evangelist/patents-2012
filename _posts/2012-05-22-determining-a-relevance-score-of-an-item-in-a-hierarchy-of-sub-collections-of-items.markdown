title: Determining a relevance score of an item in a hierarchy of sub collections of items
abstract: A hierarchical collection of items including one or more sub collections of items ordered in a hierarchy is received. A statistical measure of frequency of an item in a sub collection of items is determined. Further, statistical measures of weightages of the item are determined defining a number of sub collections in the hierarchical collection of items in which the item appears and a number of sub collections in which the item appears. A statistical measure of variability defining a number of occurrences of the item in the hierarchical collection of items across different sub collections is calculated. Furthermore, a relevance score of the item is determined based on the statistical measure of frequency, the one or more statistical measures of weightages of the item and the statistical measure of variability. Based on the relevance score, the item is presented on a computer generated graphical user interface.

Embodiments generally relate to data mining and ranking items based on relevancy and more particularly to methods and systems to determine a relevance score of an item in a hierarchy of sub collections of items.

The amount of content or data or items available on the Internet e.g. time sensitive documents such as blogs forum posts and the like continues to increase exponentially. Users with limited information and limited time have difficulty in finding items that satisfy their interests. Thus several recommendation systems e.g. text mining systems and information retrieval systems IR are used widely in the art to recommend appropriate items to users based on their inclinations and preferences. A typical way for presenting output of the IR system is by means of listing the documents and sometimes their scores of relevancy. Another popular way to present the output of text mining systems is through tag clouds. Tag clouds are used to present the relevance of items e.g. text items in a collection of documents where relevant text items appear in a dedicated area where relevance is emphasized usually by size and color.

Currently the text mining systems determine importance or significance of text items using standard Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency tf idf techniques and the like. However one of the challenges in implementing the standard tf idf technique is that the idf part at a particular small sub collection e.g. documents pertaining to a week in a yearly corpus of documents is almost constant as the idf part uses logarithmic function which is very aggressive for small collections. Thus achieving accurate relevance for the text item through tf idf technique corresponding to the small sub collection of documents may not be possible. Further there is no notion of hierarchy in the standard tf idf technique other than the simple corpus document hierarchy.

In many cases relevant text items are supervised e.g. manually selected set of tags . Many tag cloud implementations are based on these supervised tags. However in many practical scenarios such as in emails no supervised tags exist. Moreover even when supervised tags exist they are not always complete and may not cover all the topics in the document. Therefore the existing methods of determining relevance score of the text item and generating tag cloud to present relevant text item may not facilitate finding significant interesting and relevant text item in a document or a collection of documents.

Embodiments of techniques to determine relevance score of an item in a hierarchy of sub collections of items are described herein. Further the item is presented graphically on a graphical user interface based on the relevance score of the item using techniques such as tag clouds and the like. According to various embodiments the tag cloud is a visual representation of items e.g. text items where relevant text items appear in a dedicated area emphasized usually by font relative to their significance based on various factors. The tag cloud may include a plurality of text items e.g. topics in a document . The items may be but are not limited to a word phrase paragraph and section and the items may include but are not limited to text special characters numerals and any combination thereof. Further tag cloud may be used to present items of a corpus or any sub collection within it. The corpus is a hierarchical collection of documents e.g. collection of time sensitive documents such as emails blogs forum posts and the like and each document includes a plurality of items. In other words the hierarchical collection of documents includes one or more sub collection of items ordered in a hierarchy.

According to one embodiment the relevance score of the item is determined to identify significant items in the hierarchical collection of items corresponding to the sub collection of items e.g. items corresponding to a time frame . For example in a corpus e.g. hierarchical collection of items corresponding to one year of documents important or relevant text items in a sub collection of text items corresponding to a time frame e.g. a week a month and the like are presented to a user through the tag cloud. Further the tag cloud is generated based on a relevance score of the text item. Higher the relevance score higher the relevancy and vice versa.

In one embodiment the relevance score is determined based on a statistical measure of frequency of the item weightages of the item and a statistical measure of variability of the item. Therefore the important or significant items in the sub collection of items corresponding to the time frame are emphasized whereas the less significant items are suppressed. Thus higher accuracy in emphasizing significant items in the sub collection of items can be achieved and since the relevance score of the item is determined for the sub collection of items e.g. time frame such as a week a month and the like . The method of determining the relevance score of the item in a sub collection of items is described taking an example of email corpus corresponding to a time frame in the below description. However the method may be implemented in determining a significant item in a set of any collection and sub collection of items e.g. in a set of books and the like .

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment this embodiment and similar phrases means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

What items are significant can be configured based on a number of factors. For instance at step a statistical measure of frequency of an item in a sub collection of items is determined. In one exemplary embodiment the item is a text item that is analyzed in context of surrounding text items to consider synonyms and inflected forms of the text item e.g. using a lemmatizer . The lemmatizer is described in greater detail in . The sub collection of documents of the corpus includes one or more documents of the corpus associated with a time frame for instance. For example in a corpus including 200 000 emails corresponding to two years time period the emails corresponding to a week e.g. 25 emails corresponding to the first week of September 2011 are concatenated to sub collection of documents. In the sub collection of documents the normalized number of times the text item for example the word computer appears is determined using equation 1 . tf item Number of times the item appears in the week Total number of items in the document corresponding to the week 1 

In tf item tf stands for the term or item frequency. The tf item defines the normalized number of times the text item appears in the concatenated document and implies that the more times the item appears in the sub collection of documents the more significant the item is in the sub collection of documents. For example assuming the text item the word computer appears 30 times in the sub collection of documents and the sub collection of documents includes a total of 2000 text items corresponding to the first week of September 2011. The item frequency tf computer is 0.015 as in equation 2 . tf computer Number of times the text item the word computer appears in the first week of September 2011 Total number of items in the sub collection of documents corresponding to the first week of September 2011 30 2000 0.015 2 

At step one or more statistical measures of weightages of the item defining a number of sub collections in the hierarchical collection of times in which the item appears and a number of sub collections in which the item appears are determined. In one exemplary embodiment the weightages of the text item defining the number of documents in the corpus in which the item appears is determined using equation 3 . For example the number of documents in the 200 000 emails in which the text item the word computer appears is determined. idf item log Total number of documents in the corpus Number of documents in the corpus where the item appears 3 

In idf item idf stands for inverse document frequency. The idf item defines the number of documents in which the item appears in the corpus and implies that less number of times the item appears the more significant is the item. For example assuming the text item the word computer appears in 45 documents of total of 200 000 documents the weightages of the text item the word computer with respect to total number of documents of 200 000 emails idf computer is 8.4 as in equation 4 . idf computer log 200 000 45 8.4 4 

In one embodiment the weightages of the item defining the number of time frames in which the item appears is determined using equation 5 . For example the number of time frames in the two year time period in which the text item the word computer appears is determined. idf item log Total number of time frames associated with the corpus Number of time frames in which the item appears 5 

The idf item defines the number of time frames in which the item appears. For example assuming the item computer appears in two weeks time frames of total of 108 weeks e.g. 108 weeks in two years the idf computer is 3.99 as in equation 6 . idf computer log 108 2 3.99 6 

Further idf item is almost constant for each week as the idf item uses logarithmic function as logarithmic function is more aggressive for small numbers . Therefore a mathematical function which is less aggressive compared to the logarithmic function may be used for achieving the accuracy in determining the significant items. For example a less aggressive mathematical function such as a square root function may be used. Hence the weightage of the sub collection of items in this case the number of time frames e.g. number of weeks in which the text item the word computer appears is determined using less aggressive mathematical function as shown in equation 7 . idf item sqrt Total number of time frames associated with the corpus Number of time frames in which the item appears 7 

The idf item defines the number of time frames in which the item appears. For example assuming the text item the word computer appears in two weeks time frames of total of 108 weeks e.g. 108 weeks in two years the idf computer is 7.35 as in equation 8 . idf computer sqrt 108 2 7.35 8 

In one embodiment the mathematical function is selected by a configuration unit based on the sub collection of items corresponding to the time frame for which the relevance score of the item is determined. The mathematical function may be a logarithmic function a square root function a division function e.g. divide by a constant greater than 1 an exponential function e.g. 1 efor a 0 a generalization of square root function e.g. xfor a

At step a statistical measure of variability defining a number of occurrences of the item in the hierarchical collection of items across different sub collections is calculated. In other words to further emphasize in determining significant items across sub collections e.g. weeks an additional factor standard deviation std item is calculated. For example the standard deviation std computer of the item computer is computed as 3.72 using standard equations used to calculate standard deviation.

At step a relevance score of the item is determined based on the statistical measure of frequency the one or more statistical weightages of the item and the statistical measure of variability. In one exemplary embodiment the statistical measure of frequency e.g. as shown in equation 2 the weightages of the item e.g. as shown in equations 4 6 and 8 and the statistical measure of variability are multiplied to determine the relevance score of the text item the word computer as shown in equation 9 . Relevance score of the text item the word computer tf computer idf computer idf computer idf computer std computer 9 

Therefore relevance score of the text item the word computer in the first week of September 2011 0.015 8.4 3.99 7.35 3.72 13.75

At step the item is presented on a computer generated graphical user interface using a technique such as a tag cloud and the like based on the relevance score of the item in the sub collection of items as determined in step . For example the text item the word computer is displayed in the tag cloud based on the relevance score 13.75. If other items are having lower relevance score compared to the text item the word computer the text item the word computer is emphasized or vice versa. The tag cloud is described with an example in .

In one embodiment the computer system includes a processor to execute software instructions or code stored on a memory to perform the method as described in . The computer system is described in greater detail in . In one exemplary embodiment the memory includes a relevance score evaluator . The relevance score evaluator determines a relevance score of an item for a sub collection of items. The relevance score of the item is determined based on a statistical measure of frequency of the item e.g. as described in step of one or more weightages of the item e.g. as described in step of and the statistical measure of variability as described in step of . The relevance score evaluator includes a plurality of components to perform the steps described above. The plurality of components in the relevance score evaluator is described in greater detail in .

In one embodiment the relevance score evaluator includes a lemmatizer a statistics calculator a weightage calculator a configuration unit a relevance score calculator and a tag cloud generator which are communicatively coupled as shown in . The lemmatizer groups together the different inflected forms of an item or synonyms so they can be analyzed as a single item. For example the item better has good as its lemma and thereby both the items better and good can be considered as single item to determine the relevance score. In another example the item meeting may be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb i.e. to meet depending on the context e.g. in our last meeting or We are meeting again tomorrow . Further in the context Mr. Said asked for tee a classic stemmer will interpret the item said as past from of the verb say as the classic stemmer determines the inflected items to their stem base or root form. However the lemmatizer understands context and the part of speech of the item in the sentence to determine the synonyms of the item. In one exemplary embodiment lemmatizer uses Natural Language Processing NLP techniques to analyze the items. Thus the higher accuracy in determining the relevance score of the item may be achieved.

In one embodiment the statistics calculator calculates a statistical measure of variability defining a number of occurrences of the item in a hierarchical collection of items across one or more sub collections of items. For example the statistics calculator calculates standard deviation of the number of occurrences of the item computer across different time frames e.g. in weeks time frame as described in step of . In other items statistics calculator is a component responsible for calculation of statistics over the items in the corpus.

In one embodiment the weightage calculator determines a statistical measure of frequency of the item tf item as described in step of . Further one or more statistical measures of weightages of the item defining a number of sub collections in the hierarchical collection of items in which the item appears idf computer and a number of sub collections e.g. time frames in which the item appears idf computer and idf computer are determined as described in step of .

In one embodiment the configuration unit determines the mathematical function e.g. a logarithmic function a square root function a division function e.g. divide by a constant greater than 1 an exponential function e.g. 1 efor a 0 a generalization of square root function e.g. xfor a

In one embodiment the relevance score calculator determines the relevance score of the item based on input from the statistics calculator and the weightage calculator . In other items the relevance score calculator combines the input from the statistics calculator and the weightage calculator to determine the relevance score of the item. In one exemplary embodiment machine learning methods may be used to optimize the relevance score combination. Further the configuration unit determines the way in which the two inputs are combined. For example as in equation 9 the inputs are multiplied to determine the relevance score of the text item the word computer . However sophisticated combination other than multiplication may also be used depending on the time frame for which the tag cloud is generated.

In one embodiment the tag cloud generator receives the relevance score determined by the relevance score calculator and generates the tag cloud accordingly. The tag cloud generator prepares graphic presentation of the items by emphasizing on items with higher relevance scores. Further the generated tag cloud is presented on a graphical user interface through the output device . It is advantageous that technique other than tag cloud may be used to present the item based on the relevance score of the item. In one exemplary embodiment the configuration unit controls the tag cloud generator regarding the graphical representation of items.

In one embodiment the relevance score evaluator includes a topic partitioner along with the other components as described in such as a lemmatizer a statistics calculator a weightage calculator a configuration unit a relevance score calculator and a tag cloud generator. The topic partitioner segregates content of the documents corresponding to one or more topic clusters. The topic clusters includes segregation of content of the document based on topics. Further when a user is interested in a particular topic the documents of the time frame e.g. documents corresponding to a week are concatenated to form a sub collection of item may first be clustered according to topics and the tag cloud may be constructed per individual topic. Furthermore the user can extract the relevant tag cloud using a search query to extract the search results in an information retrieval IR query based search. In one exemplary embodiment the configuration unit as described in controls the topic partitioner by switching on or off the topic partitioner based on user s interest.

The tag cloud for the time frame of first week of September 2011 is depicted in . As per Table 1 the text item the word computer has a higher relevance score e.g. 13.75 compared to other two text items weather e.g. 0.047 and flood e.g. 10.58 . Therefore the text item computer is displayed with a larger font size compared to the text items weather and flood . Further the text item flood has the next higher relevance score and thereby the text item flood is displayed with larger font size compared to the text item weather . The text item weather is displayed with a font size less than the font size of the text item flood . In one exemplary embodiment the items can be emphasized with different colors highlighting and the like depending on the relevance score of the item.

It is advantageous that the method described above to determine a relevance score of the item and to generate a tag cloud based on the relevance score of the item for a time frame eliminates manual supply of tags and automatically extracts the significant items using NLP techniques to use as tags for the tag cloud. This avoids human intervention in the process of generation of the tag cloud. Further the method may be advantageous to an enterprise which maintains a collection of text messages e.g. emails blog posts or recordings of chats that customers have with service representatives. Each day new messages are added to the collection. Using the method described above the enterprise can identifying key topics for a time frame e.g. on a weekly basis on a monthly basis and the like . Thus the new developing topics can be emphasized. Further an additional functionality to identify sub topics in documents and generation of the tag cloud per sub topic can be achieved to focus on the significant topics using a topic partitioner of the relevance score evaluator.
