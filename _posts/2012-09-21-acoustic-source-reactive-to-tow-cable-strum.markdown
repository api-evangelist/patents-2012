The present invention relates to a transducer like device capable of clamping onto a tow cable. The device is responsive to the tow cable vibrating over the length of the cable such that the vibrating tow cable is an energy source for the device. A typical long cable that strums over a length supports vibrational energy produced by transverse waves of relatively short wavelengths and longitudinal energy produced by much longer longitudinal waves.

Cable strum occurs because of vortex shedding from a cable towed at an angle with respect to the flow around the cable. A tow cable supports both transverse waves and longitudinal waves. The transverse waves tend to have short wavelengths their propagation speed c in meters per second is approximately c square root over Tg W where T is the tension in Newtons W is the weight per unit length and g is acceleration due to gravity or 9.81 m s wherein m is meters and s is seconds . In water W includes the weight of the added mass which is equal to the weight of the displaced water.

Conversely longitudinal waves have much longer wavelengths because of a propagation speed governed by c square root over E where E and are respectively the Young s modulus having units of Newtons per square meter and density having units of kilograms per cubic meter of the cable. As a result on the order of one to ten longitudinal waves are contained by a mile long tow cable.

Each transverse wave creates a localized region of curvature in the cable that shortens the cable . The cable shortening generates longitudinal waves that exhibit twice the frequency of the transverse waves because the cable is shortened twice during each transverse wave cycle . This is sometimes referred to as the frequency doubling effect.

The transverse wave frequency is governed by the formula for the Strouhal frequency i.e. fs 0.2 U sin d where U is the tow speed in meters per second is the incidence angle in degrees with respect to the flow and d is the cable diameter in inches .

Towed arrays typically include a steel cable that is approximately a mile long. The movement for such a cable is nearly straight over an entire length and at a critical angle. The critical angle is the angle at which the weight of the cable in water balances the drag of the cable. The critical angle is determined by the equation 

Equation 1 can be solved for for any given tow speed. The Strouhal frequency formula fs 0.2 U sin d then indicates that the vortex shedding frequency which is the same as the Strouhal frequency is nearly constant over a wide speed range e.g. approximately 6 Hz for a one inch diameter steel tow cable . This occurs because is small enough so that the small angle approximations are valid i.e. sin cos 1 and the sin term can be neglected compared to the sin term . As a result Equation 1 becomes a linear equation in to the first order. When these assumptions are valid the incidence angle becomes approximately

In practice this result has been verified in sea tests when the strum frequency was measured as a function of tow speed. The 6 Hz transverse waves in the cable then lead to 12 Hz longitudinal waves because of the frequency doubling effect .

A mile long tow cable that is strumming over an entire length supports a substantial amount of vibration energy i.e. the vector dot product of force and displacement . In operating tests such cables have been observed to vibrate with transverse amplitudes of approximately six inches under a cable tension of over one thousand pounds.

Accordingly it is a primary purpose and general object of the present invention to harness the vibrational energy of a tow cable.

To attain the object described a feature of the present invention is a transducer like device adapted to be clamped onto a tow cable to vibrate in directions normal to the device and to radiate sound into water at high amplitudes and low frequencies as the result of the device reacting to the influence of cable strum.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring now to the drawings a transducer like device is shown in in which the device is clamped to a tow cable and which resembles a head mass of a Tonpilz transducer. The device can be made of steel or any other material appropriate for a transducer head mass.

A Tonpilz transducer typically comprises a stack of piezoelectric elements between a radiating head mass and a heavy tail mass such as a ship . In the present invention the piezoelectric stack of a Tonpilz transducer that generates vibrational energy is replaced by the mile long tow cable that generates vibrational energy along a length of the cable. The towing ship not shown acts as the heavy tail mass and the device acts as the head mass. It is more practical to deploy the cable with the attached device than to deploy an equivalent Tonpilz transducer in which the large size of the Tonpilz transducer is highly impractical if not impossible for use.

In use the longitudinal vibration of the cable causes the device to vibrate in a direction normal to a flat surface of the device. This vibration radiates sound at 12 Hz at high amplitudes. At frequencies this low diffraction causes the device to be an omni directional source as the wavelength of the radiated sound in the water is about 125 meters at 12 Hz.

As the cable is displaced sideways by six inches in one direction and then six inches in another direction the end mass moves in and back out to an original position twice for each transverse cycle. As the cable is typically under a thousand pounds or more of tension and strums at high amplitudes an end mass weighing several hundred pounds will vibrate under the influence of cable strum. Therefore the force in the longitudinal direction will be high enough to drive a very powerful transducer.

In operation the device moves transverse because of transverse waves in the cable but the motion causing acoustic radiation is motion along the axis of the cable generally in line with the longitudinal waves. Each transverse wave causes a shortening of the cable . The shortening of the cable which occurs twice per transverse period drives the longitudinal motion of the cable and causes sound radiation.

The radiating area of the device can be adjusted to achieve a better match to the specific acoustic impedance of the water and to maximize the conversion of cable vibrational energy to sound radiated into the water. This is a common practice that is well known to designers of transducers e.g. using both finite element models and experimental measurements .

Furthermore acoustical sources enlarge as the frequency decreases. A conventional source even one radiating at 100 Hz is typically too large for a practical system. This source although large takes advantage of vibrational phenomena that occur naturally in existing systems the tow cable imposes no additional burden in terms of handling systems.

Accordingly there is provided a transducer like device for use in an underwater tow assembly for surface ships and unmanned surface vehicles. The device is adaptable to be mounted or clamped on a tow cable and to extend underwater substantially throughout the length thereof in a wave like strumming configuration about a generally straight line axis.

The device comprises a head mass adapted to be affixed to the tow cable and configured to vibrate along the axis as the tow cable is displaced in one direction sideways of the cable and then in an opposite direction to radiate a low frequency continuous sound wave source at high acoustic levels. The head mass comprises a generally cylindrically shaped first portion defining a substantially flat sound radiating end surface generally normal to an axis of the tow cable and a second portion of a lesser end surface. The head mass further comprises a generally frusto conical portion between the first and second portions and having a flat aft surface.

The head mass as the device can comprise two sections that separate in a direction A away from the tow cable . Contact line is shown to illustrate a partition plane. Conversely the sections can be assembled at the contact line in direction B to join the sections in an interlocking manner by methods and attaching components known to those skilled in the art.

Partitioning the head mass is not limited to two sections. Depending on the operating requirements and environment numerous partitioning into three four and additional sections can be accomplished by attachment and separation methods also known to those ordinarily skilled in the art.

The head mass is adapted to vibrate along the axis of the tow cable and to direct sound from the first end surface centered generally along the cable. Also the head mass is adapted to vibrate in a direction along the tow cable in response to lengthwise cable vibration in order to generate the sound waves. A plurality of head masses can be clamped onto a cable ideally spaced at one longitudinal wavelength intervals on the cable for the possibility of more radiated sound.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
