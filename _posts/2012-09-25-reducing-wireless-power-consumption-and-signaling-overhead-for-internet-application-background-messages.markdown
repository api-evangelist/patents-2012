title: Reducing wireless power consumption and signaling overhead for internet application background messages
abstract: Technology is discussed for reducing the frequency of signaling overhead and power consumption on wireless mobile devices employed to support internet applications in a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN). Demands for battery power and signaling overhead frequently arise to support background messages of little significance and/or urgency when internet applications are unattended on wireless mobile device attempting to conserve power. An identification module can be triggered to identify such background messages, based on a variety of factors. The identification module can also determine whether to buffer and/or drop such messages with information local to the wireless mobile devices and/or in such background messages. Such buffering and dropping measures can reduce the frequency with which wireless mobile devices consume large amounts of power and/or require signaling overhead to send and receive these background messages.

This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 556 109 filed Nov. 4 2011.

The increased use of wireless mobile devices supporting internet applications in Wireless Wide Area Networks WWAN has created issues from increased demand for bandwidth to the accommodation of features of these internet applications. As examples of these features several internet applications can communicate frequently over the WWAN. These frequent communications can create excessive demands on the WWAN.

Additionally the frequent communications between the WWAN and certain internet applications can be power intensive resulting in undesirable drain on battery power. The relatively slow improvement in battery technology places a larger emphasis on minimizing unnecessary communications to maximize the length a wireless mobile device can remain operational using it s battery.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

Different terminology for wireless mobile devices is used in different specifications. As used herein a wireless mobile device can be a User Equipment UE or a Mobile Station MS among other possibilities. Throughout this application the terms wireless mobile device UE and MS can be used interchangeably.

As used herein the term transmission point is defined as a wireless communication device in a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN configured to communicate with a plurality of wireless mobile devices located within a geographic region referred to as a cell. Different terminologies for transmission points are used in different specifications. Terminology used for different variations of a transmission point can include but are not limited to a Base Station BS an evolved Node B eNodeB or eNB a WWAN transmission point a transmission point a wireless transmission point and a WWAN node. The terms are used interchangeably unless otherwise noted. The actual definition of a BS or eNodeB is provided in their Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers IEEE 802.16 and Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP specifications.

As used herein the term substantially refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action characteristic property state structure item or result. For example an object that is substantially enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of substantially is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action characteristic property state structure item or result.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Many types of applications no longer operate on stand alone devices. Rather the applications can operate at least in part on a server that is in communication with a computing device. Internet applications configured to operate on mobile wireless devices can continue to communicate with a server via a wireless network after a user ceases to interact with such applications i.e. when these internet applications are minimized or placed in the background. These communications can result in frequent messaging. The sending of short frequent messages by internet applications which are referred to herein as background messages can place strains on mobile battery power and on Wireless Wide Area Networks WWAN .

As used herein the term background message refers to a message generated by an internet application with a low significance and or low urgency. In addition a background message can refer to a type of packet produced by an application when it is running in the background i.e. when the application is no longer actively interacting with the user but still consuming Central Processing Unit CPC resources in order to perform tasks such as keeping a connection open providing periodic update information sending presence updates etc. Examples of internet applications that require support for these background messages include SKYPE YAHOO MESSENGER GTALK FACEBOOK TWITTER and many more. Applications related to what has been termed social media are particularly prone to such short frequent messages.

Unfortunately these background messages sent from and received by wireless mobile devices in a WWAN can cause a wireless mobile device to transition out of a power saving mode to send or receive the background messages. To come out of a power saving mode a wireless mobile device consumes power. In some instances the wireless mobile device also consumes power as it goes through the process of reestablishing connections with a WWAN. The wireless mobile device also consumes power by sending and or receiving background messages and by spending time out of a power saving mode i.e. setup to actively transmit and receive information via the WWAN .

The consumption of power caused by background messages at battery operated wireless mobile devices where power is at a premium is a significant problem. Additionally background messages can increase signaling traffic both over the air interface and within the core network of the WWAN. These increases in signaling traffic can be due to the large amount of signaling required to reestablish connections between a wireless mobile device and the WWAN in the process of transitioning the wireless mobile device out of a power saving mode.

However power intensive transitions to higher power states and signal overhead associated with frequent reconnections of wireless mobile devices with a WWAN can be avoided. Background messages are often of relatively minor significance and typically do not have strict latency requirements. Background messages with low significance and or low urgency can be identified at a transmission point and or at a wireless mobile device before they are sent across a WWAN. Once they are identified many of such background messages can be buffered or dropped. Messages that are buffered can be buffered for a period of time to allow a wireless mobile device to stay in a low power mode longer and or reduce re connection overhead in a WWAN.

In the example embodiment illustrated in the WWAN can comprise a Core Network CN and a Radio Access Network RAN . The CN can comprise an Evolved Packet Core and the RAN can comprise an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Network E UTRAN . The EPC can communicate with the internet through a Packet Data Network Gate Way PDN GW . The E UTRAN can communicate with the EPC over the Serving Gate Way S GW which can be in communication with the PDN GW to complete the link between the E UTRAN and the internet application .

Although the wireless mobile device which can be a User Equipment UE can communicate with the internet application operating on a server by means of the WWAN the UE needs to be in a connection mode such as Radio Resource Control RRC  CONNECTED for communication to take place. However A UE can expend 500 to 1500 milliwatts to maintain itself in RRC CONNECTED mode. Conversely the same UE can save a large portion of this power in a power saving mode such as Discontinuous Reception DRX mode or RRC IDLE mode. For example the UE can expend only 5 to 10 milliwatts in RRC IDLE mode potentially one hundredth two orders of magnitude or less of the power used to maintain the RRC CONNECTED mode.

The UE depicted in is first depicted in a power saving mode as indicated by the adjacent low power consumption bar depicted with the battery icon and the diamond cross hatching. However the internet application can generate a background message intended for the UE. The background message is depicted at various points in time as it can be communicated from the internet application to the UE . For example the background message is depicted as it is generated in the internet application. Again the background message is depicted as it is communicated to the PDN GW within the EPC . Next the background message is depicted as communicated to the S GW and then the background message is depicted as it is communicated to the E UTRAN .

Since the UE is initially in a power saving mode the UE for which the background message is intended cannot receive the background message. The E UTRAN can page the UE to indicate the presence of a communication for the UE. To receive the communication the UE can transition from a power saving mode to a communication mode as depicted by the high power consumption bar depicted with the battery icon and the diamond cross hatching adjacent to the UE in connected mode. A large increase in power between the UE in power save mode and connected mode can be noted.

This difference in power consumption which can span orders of magnitude can potentially be disproportionate to the levels of power consumption depicted. The difference in power consumption can vary depending on the power saving mode from which the UE transitions and or the communication mode to which the UE transitions. Examples of a power saving mode by way of illustration and without limitation can include DRX mode during an opportunity period referred to herein as DRX mode unless otherwise indicated and RRC IDLE mode.

DRX mode provides an example of one type of power saving mode for which a connection can be maintained between the UE and the E UTRAN . A power saving mode that can maintain a connection between UE and E UTRAN is referred to herein as a mid low power mode. DRX can be applied when the UE is in RRC IDLE or RRC CONNECTED mode. When DRX is applied during RRC CONNECTED mode a connection can be maintained with the E UTRAN. However the UE can power down for some pre negotiated intervals of time known as opportunity periods as opposed to on duration periods when the UE can receive transmissions. Therefore the UE may not be in a receiving mode for each and every frame and can shut down for some frames in a periodic fashion.

While applying DRX in RRC CONNECTED mode the UE can transition to an on duration period to receive the background message . The connection between the UE and the E UTRAN does not need to be re established when switching from an opportunity period to an on duration period. Hence signaling overhead is less of a concern when applying DRX in RRC CONNECTED mode. Power consumption however can remain a big problem. The magnitude of the problem can be particularly significant because of the frequency with which background messages can be sent and received and the frequency with which the UE is powered up to transition to an on duration period. 

RRC IDLE provides an example of one type of power saving mode for which a connection is not maintained between the UE and the E UTRAN . A power saving mode that does not maintain a connection between UE and E UTRAN is referred to herein as a deep low power mode. Not only must the UE power up to receive the background message but the UE can also engage in signaling to reconnect with the E UTRAN. Reconnection with the network can involve a large amount of signaling overhead. Not only can signaling be involved to establish the connection as such but additional signaling can be involved over the air interface and at the CN . The additional signaling can be for example to show that the UE is a bona fide subscriber access authentication servers establish IP tunneling etc.

Messages involved in re establishing the connection can number between twenty to thirty messages many of them involving bidirectional communication. In addition to potentially frequent drains on battery power to receive the background message therefore significant signaling overhead can also be imposed across the backbone of the WWAN and at the servers in the CN . Furthermore the UE can remain in a relatively high power mode for extended periods as it engages in the signaling involved in re establishing the connection with the WWAN. Similar problems can arise when background messages are generated at the UE. Thus frequent disconnection and reconnection by a wireless mobile device to enable frequent communication with internet applications can result in significant battery drain as well as relatively high overhead in the CN.

However the UE may not be able to send the background message to the second instance of the internet application over a WWAN because the UE can be in a power saving mode as indicated by the adjacent low power consumption bar depicted with the battery icon and the diamond cross hatching. By way of illustration and not limitation examples of the power saving mode can include DRX mode and RRC IDLE mode. Other examples of a power saving mode consistent with 3GPP LTE and other standards are also possible. Therefore the UE can transition from the power saving mode to a communication mode

A non limiting example provided by way of illustration of a communication mode can include RRC CONNECTED mode. The nature of the transition from the power saving mode to the communication mode can differ depending on the nature of the power saving mode. For example certain examples of the power saving mode such as DRX mode can maintain a connection with the WWAN while powering down to conserve power. In other examples such as RRC IDLE the connection is not maintained.

In examples for which a connection is maintained between the UE and the WWAN the UE still needs to power up to a communication mode to send the background message . As before the difference in power consumption which can span orders of magnitude can potentially be disproportionate to the levels of power consumption depicted. In examples where the connection is not maintained however not only must the UE power up to receive the background message but the UE can also engage in signaling to reconnect with the WWAN. As discussed previously reconnection with the network can involve a large amount of signaling overhead. Again the frequency with which background messages can be sent from and to the UE can result in a high cost in power and signaling overhead.

Once the UE has transitioned to communication mode the background message can be sent to a second instance of the internet application over the WWAN . The background message is depicted at various points in time as it can be communicated from the first instance of the internet application to the second instance of the internet application. The background message is first depicted at the UE where it is generated. Next the background message is depicted as it is sent to the RAN which can be an E UTRAN within the WWAN .

The background message is also depicted at the E UTRAN and then at an S GW which can serve to connect the E UTRAN to the CN which can be an EPC. Next the background message is depicted as delivered to the PDN GW which can connect the EPN to the internet . Finally the background message is depicted as delivered to the second instance of the internet application

As can be appreciated from and the cost of power consumption due to background messages can be great as can the cost of signaling overhead due to background messages. These costs become increasingly more and more important as more wireless mobile devices come to support internet applications that send such background messages on a frequent basis. The rise of social media internet applications which are particularly prone to sending such background messages further compounds the problem.

However many such background messages are of comparatively small significance. For example the internet application SKYPE can send status updates to indicate whether the application is attended or unattended by a user. Receiving such a status update for example which is typically received periodically is of little significance for a UE that is unattended and in a power saving mode . Additionally whether such background messages are received immediately or at some time later is of little significance.

Before performing a handling action on a background message packet analysis can be performed. A handling action can refer to buffering and or dropping a background message. The packet analysis can be performed on a set of transmission packets to identify one or more packets as a background message for which performing a handling action such as buffering and or dropping is appropriate. A set of transmission packets can comprise any number of transmission packets. The step of identifying one or more packets as a background message by packet analysis can take place at an identification module residing at a UE where a set of transmission packets is scheduled to be sent from the UE to the eNodeB . Where the set of transmission packets is scheduled to be sent from the eNodeB to the UE an ID module residing at the eNodeB can perform the packet analysis.

However the process of packet analysis can consume time power and other resources. In certain embodiments packet analysis can comprise deep packet inspection. Therefore in one embodiment the ID Module can remain inactive when the UE is in a communication mode . When the ID module is in communication mode additional power costs and signaling overhead that can be associated with the reception of background packets are less of an issue and may not be an issue at all. Hence the potential consumption of resources associated with packet analysis may not be warranted.

To avoid unwarranted consumption of resources associated with packet analysis an ID module whether residing with a UE or an eNodeB can be triggered or turned on when the UE enters a power saving mode . Otherwise the ID module can remain inactive. The ID module can become deactivated when the UE transitions back to communication mode

When the ID module resides at the UE the UE can monitor and communicate its mode to the ID module residing therein to trigger activation of the module. Alternatively the ID module can monitor the UE triggering itself when the UE transitions to a power saving mode . When the ID module resides at an eNodeB one or more timers at the eNodeB can indicate when a sufficient period of inactivity has passed for the UE to enter a power saving mode

One or more timers can be used to determine when it is appropriate for the UE to enter different types of low power modes such as a mid low power mode where a connection to the E UTRAN can be maintained and or a deep low power mode where a connection to the E UTRAN is not maintained. A non limiting example of a mid low power mode can include DRX mode. A non limiting example of a deep low power mode can include RRC IDLE.

When such a timer indicates it is appropriate to transition to a power saving mode a transition message can be sent to the UE from an eNodeB indicating the UE can transition to a power saving mode. In certain embodiments the transition message can indicate a particular type of transition mode to which the UE can transition. The UE and or an ID module residing thereon can monitor for a transition message. In certain embodiments the UE and the eNodeB can contain synchronous timers making the transition message unnecessary.

The eNodeB can monitor one or more timers . When one or more of these timer expires the eNodeB can trigger an ID module residing thereon. In certain embodiments the UE can initiate a request to transition into a low power mode such as a power saving mode which the eNodeB can approve or reject. In such embodiments the eNodeB can trigger the ID module residing on the eNodeB upon approval of such a request. In alternative embodiments the UE can decide to transition to a low power mode on its own. In such embodiments the transition message can be sent from the UE to the eNodeB.

Depending on the embodiment the eNodeB and or an ID module residing at the eNodeB can monitor one or more timers approval determinations and or transition messages at the eNodeB to trigger the ID module. In such embodiments the eNodeB and or the ID module can know that the UE supports the buffering and or dropping of background messages based on an advance notice sent from the UE to the E UTRAN and or an eNodeB residing thereon. The advance notice can indicate that the UE supports the performing of a handling action such as buffering and or dropping on a background message and can accommodate the resultant latency and or disappearance of such messages.

By way of illustration and not limitation an advance notice can be embedded in a new Media Access Control MAC message configured to communicate the advance notice. In another non limiting example the advance notice can be conveyed in a legacy message sent from a UE to indicate features modalities routines etc. that the UE is configured to support. A non limiting example of such a legacy message can be a Feature Group Indicator FGI . In such embodiments an unassigned index bit within an FGI can be assigned to convey this information.

Once an ID module has been triggered the ID module can perform actions such a packet analysis buffering and dropping. These actions can reduce the frequency with which power is consumed at a UE and or the frequency of additional overhead associated with reception of background messages. The following figure serves to expound on actions that can be taken by ID modules.

The ID module can analyze the packet by reading information from one or more Internet Protocol IP headers. One or more of these IP headers can carry information for packet analysis. The information can be used to identify a packet as a background message. The information can be embedded in a Time To Live TTL header field and or a Differentiated Service Code Point DSCP IP header field . Additional non limiting examples of IP headers can include an application header and or a predefined background message header. The predefined background message header field can be known a priori by a transmission point and or a wireless mobile device.

The ID module can identify a packet as a background message on the basis of a substantial match between a value of an IP header field such as those discussed above with a predefined value. Additionally a value of an IP header field within a predetermined region with respect to a threshold such as above or below the threshold can provide an indication that a packet is a background message. The presence of a predefined application header and or background message header can also provide an indication that a packet is a background message. In addition to or in place of reading an IP header the ID module can review the payload of the packet .

Most background messages are comparatively small in size. Therefore if the payload has a size below a payload threshold this can be an indication that the packet is a background message. Additionally or in the alternative the IP module can be configured to determine whether the payload size is odd or even. The ID module can be configured to interpret an odd or even value as an indication that the packet is a background message. In certain embodiments multiple indications can be necessary for an overall indication of the packet s status.

Not only can a substantial match between a predefined value and an IP header value a region for an IP header value with respect to a threshold the presence of a predefined header and payload size and characteristics be used to determine if a packet is a background message these factors can also be used to determine the appropriates of buffering the background message. Furthermore similar approaches can be used to determine when it is appropriate to drop a message. Additionally a background message can be dropped on the basis in part or whole of the type of background message to which the background message pertains. For example and without limitation status reports can comprise a type of background message that in some embodiments can be dropped or can be more likely to be dropped. Identification of a background message as a status update can be a particularly strong factor when the status update indicates an internet application is unattended.

Additionally the ID module can determine whether to buffer or drop a packet based on the mode of the relevant UE . In three different instances of the same UE are depicted to represent the UE in communication mode and two power saving modes comprising a mid low power mode where a connection with a WWAN can be maintained and a deep low power mode where the connection is not maintained. The mode of the UE can be communicated to the ID module. Similarly an importance value can be embedded in an IP header that can be used to determine whether to buffer or drop a background message. In one embodiment a background message may be dropped if an updated background message is received that contains the same but updated information. For instance a status of whether a person is active or inactive on their social media application may be received at a periodic rate. When a next status background message is received the previous background message can be dropped.

If the UE is in a deep low power mode the ID module can simply determine to drop a background message or use this information as a factor suggestive of the appropriates of dropping the background message. Conversely if the UE is in a mid low power mode the ID module can determine to buffer background message or use this information as a factor suggestive of the appropriateness of buffering the background message. Where the UE is in a communication mode the ID module can be suspended and the background message can be allowed to proceed .

The ID module can include a buffer in which the packet can be buffered . The buffer however can also be located outside of the ID module while remaining in communication with the ID module. As indicated by the two packets depicted by miniaturized versions of the packet in the buffer in the buffer can hold a set of packets where the set can be a wide range of sizes.

The buffer can retain and the delay the packets background messages therein for a period of time. The period of time can reduce the frequency with which the UE has to draw on power and or impose additional signaling overhead to send and receive background messages. The period of time can be determined so as to place reasonable demands of the power of the UE and or WWAN resources with respect to signaling overhead.

By way of a non limiting example used for purposes of illustration a timer used to determine whether a UE can remain in a mid low power mode and or a deep power mode can be the basis of such a determination. If messages are sent or received during this timer the UE may not be allowed to stay in mid low power mode a deep power mode or transmission from a mid low power mode to a deep power mode. Therefore background messages can be buffered until after such a timer has expired allowing the UE to receive the background message and then return or proceed to a low power or lower power mode respectively. Many different approaches to determining a period of time buffering can be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.

In certain embodiments the buffered background messages can be sent on their way after the UE enters one of its pre scheduled wake up periods. A wake up scheduled to check a paging channel can comprise one example of such a wake up period. This wake up period can span one or more wake up periods that would otherwise be observed but which are ignored to reduce resource demands.

The method can comprise triggering at one of an eNodeB and a UE an ID module upon the UE entering a low power mode. The low power mode can be a power saving mode such as by way of example and not limitation DRX mode and RRC IDLE mode. The ID module can identify a background message by packet analysis of a set of packets. Packets in the set of packets can be intended for transmission to an eNodeB or UE. A handling action can be performed on the background message. Such a handling action can comprise buffering the background message and or dropping the background message to reduce a frequency of reliance on support resources such as battery power and signaling overhead for sending and receiving background messages.

The method can further comprise reading by the ID module an IP header field of a packet in the set of packets. The IP header can be read to acquire information for the packet analysis. Depending on the embodiment and by way of illustration and not limitation the IP header field can comprise a TTL IP header field a DSCP IP header field an application header and or a predefined background message header known a priori by an eNodeB and or the UE on which an ID module resides.

In certain embodiments the method can also comprise determining whether performing the handling action comprises buffering the background message and or dropping the background message. The determination can be based on at least one of a substantial match between a value of the IP header field with a predefined value. The determination can also be based on whether the value of the IP header field is below a threshold and or a payload with an even sized or odd sized payload. Additionally the determination can be based on the presence of a predefined application header and or the presence of a predefined background message header known a priori by at least one of an eNodeB and a UE on which an ID module resides.

Some examples of the method can further comprise determining whether performing the handling action comprises one of buffering the background message and dropping the background message. The determination can be based at least in part on the low power power saving mode of the UE. The low power power saving mode of the devise can comprise a mid low power mode. A power saving mode such as DRX mode which can maintain a connection with a WWAN provides one non limiting example of such a mid low power mode. The low power power saving mode of the devise can also comprise a deep low power mode. A power saving mode such as RRC IDLE mode which does maintain a connection with a WWAN provides one non limiting example of such a deep low power mode.

Additionally depending on the embodiment the method can also comprise providing advance notice from the UE to the eNodeB. The advance notice can indicate that the UE supports performing the handling action on the background message the handling action comprising buffering the background message and or dropping the background message. In such embodiments the triggering of the ID module can occur as a corollary of the UE entering the low power mode. Providing such an advance notice can comprise sending a MAC message configured to provide the advance notice and or embedding the advance notice in an FGI.

As further examples of potential additional features of the method some embodiments can send the buffered background message when the UE performs a periodic wake up consistent with the low power mode of the UE. Also in some embodiments triggering the ID module identifying the background message and performing the handling action can occur within a MAC layer at the eNodeB where downlink transmission occurs and or within a MAC layer at the UE where uplink transmission occurs.

The monitoring module can be configured to monitor the UE to determine whether the UE is in one of a power saving mode and not in the power saving mode. The inspection module which can be in communication with the monitoring module can be configured to review a set of packets. The inspection module can review the set of packets for an indication that a packet in the set of packets comprises a background message when the UE is in the power saving mode. The response module can be in communication with the inspection module. Furthermore the response module can be configured to buffer the background message until the UE enters a wake up phase or a period of time has elapsed when the indication does not contain a parameter value contrary to buffering. Where a packet does not include an overall indication that the packet is a background message such a parameter value contrary to buffering can be considered present.

Some embodiments of the device can further comprise a determination module in communication with the response module . The determination module can be configured to direct the response module to perform buffering the message and or dropping the message based. The direction can be based on the parameter value in the indication. The indication can reside in an IP header field of the background message.

In certain of such embodiments the determination module can direct the response module to buffer the background message when 1 a parameter value in an IP header corresponds with a first predetermined value 2 the parameter value is within a first predetermined region being one of above and below a threshold 3 the background message has a payload with an even sized payload and the payload also has a size below a first payload threshold 4 the background message has a predefined application header corresponding to a first set of application headers and or the background message has a predefined buffer header known a priori by at least the eNodeB and or the UE .

Additionally in some embodiments of the device the determination module can direct the response module to drop the background message when 1 the parameter value corresponds with a second predetermined value 2 the parameter value is within a second predetermined region being one of above and below the threshold the second predetermined region defined as an opposite of the first predetermined region relative to the threshold 3 the background message has an even sized payload when the payload also has a size below a payload threshold 3 the background message has a predefined application header corresponding to a first set of application headers and or 4 the background message has a predefined drop header known a priori by the eNodeB and or the UE.

Furthermore in some embodiments the determination module can direct the response module to buffer the background message when the power saving mode comprises a mid low power mode. Conversely the determination module can direct the response module to drop the background message when the power saving mode comprises a deep low power mode. With respect to the device the mid low power mode can be a DRX mode and the deep low power mode can be an RRC IDLE mode. With respect to some embodiments the IP header field can be a TTL IP header field DSCP IP header field an application header and or a predefined background message header. The predefined background message header can be known a priori by the eNodeB and or the UE.

Certain embodiments can include a notification module . The notification module can be configured to provide a notice to the eNodeB that the UE supports at least one of buffering background messages and dropping background messages. In some embodiments the monitoring inspection and response modules can reside within a MAC layer.

The method can comprise reading an IP header field at one of a UE and an eNodeB for a series of packets. The reading can begin when the UE enters a low power mode. Additionally the method can comprise indicating the presence of a background message when a parameter value is read from the IP header field that is 1 substantially a predetermined value 2 within a predetermined region relative to a threshold 3 corresponds to a predefined application header 4 corresponds to a predefined background message header known a priori by at the wireless eNodeB and or the UE and or indicating the presence of a background message when the background message has a packet size that 1 can be one of an even size and an odd size and or 2 within a pre determined range.

Additionally the method can comprise determining a handling action with respect to the background message. The handling action can comprise buffering the background message and or dropping the background message. The handling action can also be performed on the background message.

In some embodiments determining a handling action can further comprise determining to buffer the background message when the parameter value correlates to an importance value above an importance threshold. Additionally determining the handling action can also comprise dropping the background message when the parameter value correlates to an importance value not above the importance threshold.

Determining the handling action can also comprise determining to buffer the background message when a combination of a weighted importance value and a weighted mode value produce a combined value correlated to a first determination to buffer the background message. In such embodiments the weighted importance value can be correlated to the parameter value. The weighted mode value can be correlated to the UE being in a mid low power mode and or a deep low power mode.

Alternatively determining the handling action can also comprise determining to drop the background message when a combination of a weighted importance value and a weighted mode value combine to produce a combined value correlated to a second determination to drop the background message. Again the weighted importance value can be correlated to the parameter value. The weighted mode value can also be correlated to the UE being in a mid low power mode and or a deep low power mode. Additionally a determination can be made to drop the background message when the parameter value indicates the background message is a status update conveying a message that an application is in an unattended mode.

In certain embodiments the mid low power mode can be a DRX mode and the deep low power mode can be an RRC IDLE mode. In some embodiments reading the IP header field indicating the presence of the background message determining the handling action and performing the handling action can take place in a MAC layer. Additionally some embodiments of the method can further comprise first indicating by the UE to the eNodeB that the UE is configured for a background message buffering scenario and or a background message dropping scenario.

In addition to actions taken to buffer and or drop background messages at a UE and or an eNodeB actions can be taken with respect to the background messages to facilitate the buffering and dropping of such messages. Such actions can configure background messages to provide indications about the appropriateness of buffering and or dropping such messages. The following figure can illustrates examples of a method consistent with such additional actions.

The method can comprise determining that a message originating at an application is of a message type corresponding to a predetermined list of background message types. An IP header field can be embedded with a parameter value indicating that the message is a background message. The background message can then be sent to its destination.

Some embodiments can further comprise evaluating the message to assign an importance level. The importance level can be assigned to the message within a predetermined code included in the parameter value. Depending on the embodiment the IP header field can be a TTL IP header field a DSCP IP header field an application header and or a predefined background message header. The background header can be known a priori by at least one of an eNodeB and a UE.

Certain embodiments can further comprise providing an indication encoded in the parameter value. The indication can be about a first handling action where the UE is in a DRX mode. Conversely the indication can be about a second handling action where the UE is in an RRC IDLE mode.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives Solid State Drives SSD flash RAM or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device may include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s may be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus appearances of the phrases in one embodiment or in an embodiment in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

As used herein a plurality of items structural elements compositional elements and or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary. In addition various embodiments and example of the present invention may be referred to herein along with alternatives for the various components thereof. It is understood that such embodiments examples and alternatives are not to be construed as defacto equivalents of one another but are to be considered as separate and autonomous representations of the present invention.

Furthermore the described features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description numerous specific details are provided such as examples of materials fasteners sizes lengths widths shapes etc. to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.

While the forgoing examples are illustrative of the principles of the present invention in one or more particular applications it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications in form usage and details of implementation can be made without the exercise of inventive faculty and without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention. Accordingly it is not intended that the invention be limited except as by the claims set forth below.
