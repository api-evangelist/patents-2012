title: Deployment of software applications on a cloud computing platform
abstract: In one aspect, a software application with application artifacts is deployed on a cloud computing platform. The cloud computing platform includes a platform product that can provide functionality that is required by the application. Application metadata is created based on analyzing the application artifacts and describes the application artifacts requirement. An application repository stores the application artifacts and the application metadata. A product description defines an application product for the software application and a product reference to the platform product is defined. The product description and the product reference are published in the application repository to update the application metadata. A composite repository refers to the application product and the platform product. The composite repository is transferred to a platform repository provided by the cloud computing platform.

Software complexity is increasing resulting in changes to product cycles requirements and modes of delivery of software applications. Customers needs are being transformed to request flexibility in terms of processes landscape and software components. Development of new software applications often relies on existing previously developed functionality. Typically software applications can adopt or get access to different services and capabilities from other software offerings. It is a common use case to adapt existing functionality to perform in a new environment. There are a number of scenarios for providing software components or entire applications for reuse by customers or end user. For example software platforms can provide functionality that can be extended and therefore new applications can be built on top of them.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources as a service over a network e.g. the Internet . Software as a Service SaaS is a type of a solution where a cloud service provider allows software applications and various hardware and software resources on demand when requested by an end user e.g. customer .A customer of on demand applications is free from the procurement and maintenance of the hardware and software needed for executing the applications. Platform as a Service PaaS is another category of cloud computing solutions that provides the computing platform including operating system programming language execution environment database and web server to facilitate the development and deployment of on demand applications and services.

PaaS is a growing technology space offering possibilities for optimization of information technology IT spending. It provides facilities required to support the lifecycle of web applications and services available from the Internet. Applications can run as a SaaS on the infrastructure that is provided from a PaaS provider. PaaS may give application developers the tools to design develop test deploy and host their software applications as well as use of application services and infrastructure. Typically when an application is deployed on a given PaaS it is expected to find it provisioned and ready to be installed and stared. Depending on the complexity of the solution the provisioning process may involve a series of tedious tasks prone to errors.

Embodiments of techniques for deployment of software application on a cloud computing platform are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment this embodiment and similar phrases means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

In one embodiment software applications can be developed based on available platforms or platform products to build new functionality as an extension to the existing functionality. For example a platform can be provided by a third party e.g. a cloud computing platform that allows provisioning of the software application in a cloud environment. A PaaS solution may provide an application runtime user interface UI development toolkits enterprise services internal configuration etc. that can be adopted and used in the development of the software application. In another embodiment PaaS offerings may provide support in the lifecycle process of a given application in the process of deployment installation and maintenance of fully functional applications that are built and run on a given PaaS. A provisioning process can prepare the application containing software components e.g. both application components and infrastructural components together with the right configuration in the execution environment. In one embodiment the infrastructural components can be software entities provided by the platform e.g. platform services core runtime etc. In another embodiment the PaaS solution may take care of uniting the provided platform s infrastructural components and separately developed application components for a given application. Thus the application would be deployed and ready to be started.

Eclipse development platform provides frameworks where plug in extensions can be created. Software developers including commercial vendors can build brand and package products using the platform as a base technology. These products can be sold and supported commercially. Therefore the efficient provisioning of the developed products is especially important. The Eclipse development platform could be used to develop applications in various programming languages such as but not limited to Java Perl C C PHP etc. An Eclipse based product is a stand alone program e.g. self contained and installable software application built with the Eclipse based development platform. A product may optionally be packaged and delivered as one or more features. A feature may correspond to a particular functionality of the product or the application and usually groups a number of unitary software components that could be managed together as a single entity. According to the terminology adopted in Eclipse projects such unitary software components are called plugins. The plugins are the basic installable and executable units or software code structures built by the Eclipse developers.

By definition products include all the code e.g. plugins needed to run the corresponding applications. For example a product may include a newly developed Java based application a Java Runtime Environment JRE and the Eclipse platform code. The current Eclipse provisioning platform p2 requires that the plugins the JRE and the necessary Eclipse platform code have to be packaged and installed together as a single product. In one embodiment packaging different types of application plugins together can be substituted with references in the product definition to the necessary parts. In one embodiment these parts can be defined also as products.

There are different technology solutions that may implement provisioning of applications in a cloud environment together with an existing platform product provided by an on demand platform. For example the Equinox p2 provisioning platform for Open Services Gateway initiative OSGi based applications. The p2 platform is part of the Equinox project of Eclipse . The Equinox p2 provisioning platform includes a general purpose provisioning infrastructure that can be used for provisioning a variety of applications.

In one embodiment the software product may represent an application that requires additional functionality in order to be executed. Application artifacts are developed for the software application. In one embodiment the additional functionality can be provided from a cloud computing platform and thus the application can be started in a cloud environment. The application runs as a SaaS on top of the cloud computing platform. A deployment request can be sent to an orchestrator to deploy the application artifacts on the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment the orchestrator can manage the lifecycle of developed and deployed software application on the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment the orchestrator can be a virtual machine VM that takes care to deploy start and stop the applications. In another embodiment the orchestrator can install the application on different VMs where the application is accessed by end users. In one embodiment the orchestrator can automatically provision more than one VM to host one application. This is performed without the need of an additional interaction for example from a user.

The application artifacts can be provided for deployment directly from an Integrated Development Environment IDE or from a customer s repository. In one embodiment the customer s repository can be accessed from a network location for example on a specified uniform resource locator URL . For example Eclipse provisioning mechanism p2 may be utilized to generate the customer s repository to be a p2 repository. The application artifacts can be compiled and built. In one embodiment the application artifacts can be OSGi bundles. In another embodiment the application artifacts may be included in one or more Java ARchive JAR or .jar binary files or one or more Web application ARchive WAR files. The different files may be stored in one or more folders. In one embodiment the deployment request can transfer the application artifacts to a deploy service in the orchestrator . When the deploy service receives the deployment request the application artifacts are analyzed to determine application artifacts requirements. In one embodiment the metadata of the artifacts can be analyzed. Application metadata is created based on the analysis.

In one embodiment the application artifacts may include metadata information that can be stored in a META INF folder in a manifest.mf file. The manifest.mf file is part of a standard specification to which OSGi adds additional metadata. Any non OSGi runtime will ignore the OSGi metadata. OSGi bundles can be used without restrictions in non OSGi Java based environment.

The deploy service creates an application repository and publishes application metadata and application artifacts in the application repository . In one embodiment the application repository can be published with the Equinox p2 Publisher. According to the Eclipse terminology the p2 Publisher provides means to add deployable entities into p2 repositories from a number of different sources. In another embodiment the application metadata describes the application requirements of the received application artifacts . For example the requirements can be provided from an on demand runtime platform a cloud computing platform or other PaaS offering. In another embodiment part of the requirements can be provided from another software offering or more than one software offerings which also have to be included in the deployment process on the cloud computing platform. The application artifacts correspond to the application artifacts received from the deployment request . In one embodiment the application artifacts can be converted versions of the application artifacts . For example WAR files can be converted to Web application bundles WABs when the software application that is provisioned is an OSGi based application.

In one embodiment the application repository can be a p2 repository created based on the p2 provisioning mechanism provided by Eclipse . In one embodiment the application metadata can be p2 metadata that contains useful information about the elements that can be installed. The p2 provisioning process may generate metadata describing installable units IUs . The application metadata describes the different elements of a product to be installed. The format of the application metadata can be for example a text file of certain format. In one embodiment the application metadata can also describe physical characteristics of the application artifacts . In addition the application metadata describes requirements of the application artifacts and their provided capabilities. In one embodiment the requirements of the application artifacts can be requirements for functionality that can be provided by already implemented enterprise services runtime infrastructure etc. These requirements can be provided by the cloud computing platform that is used for deploying the software product that is defined for the software application.

The below Table 1 shows parts of exemplary application metadata included in file content.xml such as the application metadata that is published in the p2 application repository after analyzing the received application artifacts for deployment. The application metadata can include configuration information for the described IUs.

The below Table 2 represents exemplary part of application metadata such as the application metadata describing information about the application artifacts that can be used during the installation of the software application. For example the actual size of the application artifacts. The artifacts.xml file includes metadata regarding the installable code e.g. the binary file or files corresponding to application artifacts developed for the software application 

As illustrated in Table 1 the content.xml file describes the IUs with their dependencies and configurations. The IUs described in the application metadata are presented with their provided and required capabilities. According to the Eclipse terminology the described IUs correspond to features and plugins. As Table 2 shows the artifacts may be developed in the terms of the Open Services Gateway initiative OSGi framework. The artifact binaries e.g. OSGi bundle file MyAdditionalBundle according to the definition in Table 1 may be stored in a plugins subfolder on the location of the application repository where the metadata files are also stored.

In one embodiment the software application can be deployed as an Eclipse based product. An Eclipse based product is a stand alone program e.g. self contained and installable software built using the Eclipse development platform. A product may optionally be packaged and delivered as one or more of so called features. A feature may correspond to a particular functionality of the product or the application and usually groups a number of unitary software artifacts that could be managed together as a single entity. According to the terminology adopted in Eclipse projects such unitary software artifacts are called plugins. The plugins are the basic installable and executable units or software code structures built by the Eclipse developers.

When an application is developed to include features or functionality provided by an additional software application for example a cloud computing platform a new product may be defined to frame or brand the new application according to one embodiment. Table 3 shows the content of an exemplary product description in a file myApplicationProduct.product in eXtensible Markup Language XML file format.

In one embodiment a product description such as the description in file myApplicationProduct.product is created to define an application product with id myAdditionalProduct as presented in Table 3 for the software application that is developed on top of functionality provided by a cloud computing platform. For example the functionality can be provided from one or more platform products available on the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment the application product defines the application artifacts for example as features and plug ins that are developed for the software application that is being deployed. In another embodiment a software application that is deployed on a cloud computing platform can use a platform product defined by the cloud computing platform. For example the platform product can be defined in a file in XML format. In one embodiment the product can be defined to describe functionality that is provided from the cloud computing platform such as enterprise services runtime environment. For example the enterprise services can include services such as a persistency service identity service mail service etc. In one embodiment the platform product can include a core runtime environment such as a Java application server.

In one embodiment the connection between the application product and a platform product may be defined with an additional entry in a product reference . For example the reference to the platform product may be included in an additional descriptor file e.g. file p2.inf as shown in Table 4. In one embodiment the p2.inf file presents an exemplary product reference such as the product reference .

The p2.inf file can be used to specify the platform product that can be used to provide the application artifacts requirements of the application artifacts that are defined in the application metadata . According to Table 4 the reference to the platform product is defined by the platform product s name myPlatformProduct .

In another embodiment the p2.inf file can specify the required functionality provided by the platform product for example the enterprise services provided by the platform product. In one embodiment a reference can be defined from the p2.inf file to an identity management service that is provided as an enterprise service from the platform product myPlatformProduct . The reference to the identity management service can be defined in the p2.inf file by the name of the service as in Table 5 presented below. The product reference can include also a reference to the software application that is deployed on the cloud computing platform. For example the software application can be a web application named HelloMail and the p2.inf file can refer to the web application as presented in Table 5.

In one embodiment the product description and the product reference can be published in the application repository . In such manner the application metadata that persist in the application repository can be updated and includes description of the platform product .

Table 6 represents exemplary pieces of metadata that can be generated and inserted in the application metadata after publishing the product description and the product reference in the application repository . Table 5 presents description of the IUs that are additionally defined in the application metadata after publishing the product description for the application product and the product reference to the platform product . In one embodiment the description of the application product in the updated application metadata can refer to the name of the platform product that is provided by the cloud computing platform myPlatformProduct . The platform product provides functionality that is required by the application product. In one embodiment the presented pieces of metadata presented in Table 5 can be inserted in the application metadata file content.xml presented in Table 1 .

In one embodiment a root installable unit of the IUs described in the application metadata may correspond to the application product. For instance the root installable unit for the application metadata can be the unit with id myAdditionalProduct presented in Table 6.

After publishing the product description and the product reference the application metadata is updated and describes IUs that are sufficient for provisioning the software application in the cloud environment. In one embodiment a composite repository is created in the application repository that includes composite metadata. The composite repository can be a composite p2 repository that stores metadata comprising one or more IUs. The IUs describe functionality delivered by plugins and features. In one embodiment the composite repository refers to the application repository and a platform product such as platform product . In another embodiment the reference to the platform product can be defined by a reference to the repository that includes the platform product . The reference to the application repository and the platform product can be defined as relative paths not stating the full path to the location e.g. .. ref . In another embodiment the references can be defined as absolute paths. Further the references can be defined in a combination of relative paths and absolute paths. For example the reference to the application repository can be based on a relative path and the reference to the platform product can be based on absolute path e.g. uniform resource identifier URI . In one embodiment the composite metadata can be defined in a file with XML format. Table 7 and Table 8 presented below show exemplary composite metadata in metadata files compositeContent.xml and compositeArtifact.xml .

In one embodiment the composite metadata points to location where the application product and platform product are accessible. For example the location of the application product can be a p2 repository such as the application repository . Respectively the platform product can be accessed from a separate repository that can be accessed over a network connection. In one embodiment the platform product can be located at a platform repository that is provided by the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment the cloud computing platform may refer to one or more connected computer systems that provide necessary environment for development deployment and starting of a software product such as an Eclipse based product. In one embodiment the composite repository can be placed at a location accessible by the cloud computing platform or as part of the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment the composite repository refers to the application artifacts by pointing to the application repository that is publishing for the application artifacts that are received for deployment. The composite repository refers separately to the platform product that provides the required functionality from the application repository which is declared in the application metadata. The separation of the references can be applied when changes to the application artifacts are made without any change in the platform product or vice versa. In addition for example by separating the platform provided functionality from the application artifacts and referring to them by using the product definitions and repository locations can minimize the application storage on the platform repository .

In one embodiment the application repositories such as the application repository keeps the application artifacts the application metadata the product description the product reference and the composite repository. In one embodiment the application repository refers to the platform product with a relative path. Respectively the application repository refers to the application product with a relative path in another embodiment. In another embodiment the platform product can be deployed on the platform repository from a set of repositories for example p2 repositories. The set of repositories can include a repository containing software artifacts providing functionality for an enterprise service e.g. mail service etc. In another embodiment the set of repositories can include a repository providing runtime environment. Additionally the repository providing runtime environment can provide configuration information required to execute a software application in a cloud environment.

In one embodiment a software application that is based on a cloud computing platform can be deployed installed and started on virtual machines VMs and then can serve users requests through a network. In one embodiment a request can be received to start and install the software application on a VM. For example the request can be an end user s request or a request from the IDE used for developing the software application. In another embodiment the software application can be started on a target server that can be defined in the platform product that is provided from the cloud computing platform. The target server can be an application server for example Java application server. In another embodiment an input can be received that can request restarting of the software application installed on the target server on the VM. In another embodiment the restarting operation can include updating the application artifacts e.g. binaries of the application product that is defined for the software application. The restarting operation can also include updating the platform provided functionality coming from a platform product such as the platform product . In one aspect the functionality developed for the software application can be updated separately from the functionality provided by the cloud computing platform.

In one embodiment the platform repository can provide platform spaces. In one embodiment a space can be a logical entity for separation such as an account that a customer of a cloud computing platform can receive. For example customers can use a space for their own business needs by creating different applications in the space. In one embodiment a platform space  can be used for the deployment of the application artifacts on the cloud computing platform. In one embodiment the application repository is transferred to the platform space  in an application that is part of the platform space . The application repository is transferred in the application . Therefore the platform space  includes an application repository that corresponds to the application repository .

The different functionalities of a product may be related to and dependent on each other. In one embodiment a hierarchy may be defined between the functionalities where one functionality is subordinate to dependent on or included in another functionality. As shows functionality R is included in functionality Q which in turn is subordinate to functionality K together with functionality P . For example functionality P could provide messaging service as part of the social network services provided by functionality K .

Further shows a new application e.g. functionality X that builds upon product A . In other words the installation and execution of functionality X and respectively the building block of functionality X depend on a preliminary or simultaneous installation of product A . For example functionality X could be an online shopping solution that needs the user authentication service of functionality and the webserver product A provides the runtime environment for both functionality and the new functionality X . Accordingly functionality X cannot be installed as a standalone computer application. First product A or alternative webserver product should be installed then the installation of functionalities X and e.g. the shopping solution and the authentication application could commence. Accordingly functionality X may be included in product A or a new product could be defined including functionality X and the necessary components of product A e.g. the functionalities and building blocks to .

In one embodiment product X is defined to include functionality X and a reference to product A . The definition of product X may also include reconfigurations of one or more of the elements of product A functionalities and building blocks to . For example the online shopping solution represented by functionality X could be described as the new standalone and self contained product X where the prerequisite webserver product A is included in the description of product X by reference without copying the definitions and the descriptions of product A and its components to except for the differences the reconfiguration .

The composite repository includes references to the application repository and the platform product . The references can be defined to the repositories that contain the application artifacts part of the application product and the repositories that contain the artifacts part of the platform product. When starting the software product defined in the application repository an installed software application is located on an application server on a virtual machine . In one embodiment the installed software application can be a business application that provides services to the end user via a network communication by using a web browser. In another embodiment the installed software application incorporates the functionality provided by the platform product that persists in the requirements of the application artifacts that are developed for the software application. The installed software application can be restarted which will induce a new installation of the software application by reading from the composite repository the references to the included products. If there is a change in the definition of the platform product or a separate change in the definition of the application product the change will be inherited in the restarted software application. In one embodiment the change in the definition of the platform product can be a change in the implementation of provided enterprise services or new enterprise services defined in the platform product. In another embodiment the change can be in the definition of the application product which can require additional functionality when an update to the implementation of the application artifacts is made.

At step the application artifacts are analyzed and application metadata is created to describe the application artifacts requirements. At step the application artifacts are published together with the application metadata onto an application repository such as the application repository in . At step a product description is created for the application product that is being deployed. In one embodiment the product description is such as the product description in . At step a product reference is created to specify a platform product that can satisfy the application artifact requirements and the platform product is provided by a cloud computing platform. At step the product description and the product reference are published to the application repository and thus the application metadata is updated. The updated application metadata refers to the application product and the platform product. At step a composite repository is created in the application repository that includes references to the application repository and the platform product. In one embodiment the references to the platform product can be defined by a reference to the repository that contains the platform product. At step the application repository is transferred to a platform repository that is provided by the cloud computing platform.
