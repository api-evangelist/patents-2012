This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 547 570 filed on Oct. 14 2011 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 592 386 filed on Jan. 30 2012 both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties for all purposes.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to emergency medical devices and more specifically to applications for communicating with such devices.

Existing devices for use in emergency medical response situations for example defibrillators often each have their own software applications providing an interface for receiving data from such devices. For example a defibrillator device may include a physical interface such as a serial port or Ethernet interface for connecting the defibrillator with a personal computer. The user must install device application software onto the personal computer either by download or using physical media provided to the user for example a DVD ROM with the device software. This application software enables the exchange of data and in some cases control of the medical device by the computing device.

However distributing device application software in this way requires that the software developer provide separate development efforts based on target hardware and software platforms for example MS Windows Mac OS X Linux iOS Android and Windows Mobile. Maintenance and upgrades for such software can also be challenging as it requires redistribution of software and must often be carefully synchronized with vendor specific upgrades. The makers of such software and devices also often have difficulty tracking which user is using which version of software furthermore the fact that a particular version of software was delivered to a user does not always mean that the user installed that particular version.

In Example 1 a portable medical device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a communication system a web application server configured to create a server client communications connection with a user device via the communication system wherein the web application server is further configured to automatically send to the user device a software application to be run on the user device which will permit the user device to access data from the portable medical device and may also permit the user device to exchange information and data with the medical device for example configuration information patient data and or initiation of internal checks.

In Example 2 the portable medical device of Example 1 wherein the portable medical device is a defibrillator.

In Example 4 the portable medical device of of Example 1 wherein the portable medical device is a non invasive cardiac support pump.

In Example 5 The portable medical device of Example 1 wherein the portable medical device is a wearable cardioverter defibrillator.

In Example 6 the portable medical device of any of Examples 1 4 wherein the web application server is further configured to prompt automatic reboot of the user device upon the user device s receipt of the software application.

In Example 7 the portable medical device of any of Examples 1 6 wherein the web application server is further configured to prompt automatic display on the user device of a prompt asking for confirmation of the installation of the software application for example upon reboot.

In Example 8 a method for automated delivery of application software supporting the hardware software capabilities of a medical device according to embodiments of the present invention includes establishing a server client communications connection with a user device with a web application server embedded in a medical device automatically sending to the user device a software application to be run within a web browser of the user device and sending data from the medical device to the software application running in the web browser.

In Example 9 the method of paragraph Example 8 wherein the medical device is a defibrillator and the user device is a computing device.

In Example 11 the method of Example 8 wherein the medical device is a noninvasive cardiac support pump.

In Example 12 the method of Example 8 wherein the medical device is a wearable cardioverter defibrillator.

In Example 13 the method of any of Examples 8 12 further comprising prompting automatic reboot of the user device upon the user device s receipt of the software application.

In Example 14 the method of any of Examples 8 13 further comprising initiating automatic display on the user device of a prompt asking for confirmation of the installation of the software application upon reboot.
