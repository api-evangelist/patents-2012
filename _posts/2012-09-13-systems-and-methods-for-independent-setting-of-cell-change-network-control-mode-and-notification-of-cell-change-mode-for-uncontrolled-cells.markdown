title: Systems and methods for independent setting of cell change network control mode and notification of cell change mode for uncontrolled cells
abstract: Systems and Methods for Independent Setting of Cell Change Network Control Mode and Notification of Cell Change Mode for Uncontrolled Cells are provided. In some cases, separate behavior is specified for mobile stations in respect of uncontrolled cells. In some cases, behavior is signalled by the signalling used for normal cells, but different meaning is attributed to the signalling. In some cases, at least one further criterion is combined with the signalling for controlled cells to determine the behavior for controlled cells. In some cases, additional signalling is employed.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 690 816 filed Jan. 20 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The application relates to cell change in wireless networks and in particular to notification of cell change and network control over cell change.

Some cells are uncontrolled in the sense that a PLMN public land mobile network operator does not control the location and or operation of the cell. Other cells are controlled in the sense that the operator does control both the location and operation of the cells. Examples of uncontrolled cells include for example CSG closed subscriber group cells cells controlled by home enode b s and home node b s. These cells are also sometimes referred to as being uncoordinated in the sense that they are not subject to normal radio cell planning.

It is generally understood that there are many methods of performing a handover for controlled cells. Inbound handover in this context refers to a cell change from a target cell s perspective where resources for example timeslots frequency channels scrambling codes etc. for transmission and or reception in the cell are allocated to a mobile station in advance of the mobile station performing a cell change to that cell particularly in response to a request from the controller of the device s serving cell.

While the uncontrolled cells may be configured to use spectrum that is owned by the operator the network operator does not have the same control over uncontrolled cells as for controlled cells. Typically the network operator does not own the support structure towers etc. does not own or control the backhaul connection e.g. Digital Subscriber Line DSL connections does not know or control when a given uncontrolled cell is going to be switched on and may not know or control the locations of uncontrolled cells. The operator will typically still have control of various parameters such as operating frequency transmit power etc. if the operator owns the spectrum license.

In order to perform a handover to a target cell controlled or uncontrolled a MS mobile station typically needs to provide identifying information relating to the target cell to the current serving cell so that it can initiate a handover process. In particular the current serving cell needs to be able to communicate with possibly via a core network the cell controller for the target cell. However the current serving cell may not be aware of how to reach the cell controller for the target cell particularly if the target cell is an uncontrolled cell unless provided with explicit identification information for the cell such as a cell global identity . This makes handover to such cells difficult. In contrast for a controlled target cell it may be sufficient for the mobile station to provide the current serving cell with information about the target cell. This does not require or cause the acquisition of any broadcast information from the target controlled cell for the serving cell to be able to reach the cell controller for the target controlled cell since the serving cell or some part of the network may be able to map other identifying features of the cell such as operating frequency scrambling code etc. to the identity of the target cell or its controller.

There are three modes of operation relating to mobility from a GERAN GSM EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution Radio Access Network cell to another not necessarily GERAN cell. The commanded mode is indicated in broadcast signalling NETWORK CONTROL ORDER sent in SI2quater message see 3GPP TS 44.018 but may also be signalled in point to point signalling. The commanded mode applies both in packet transfer mode and in packet idle mode. If a circuit switched connection is active e.g. in a voice call different procedures apply approximately similar to the rules for NC2 described below although handover is the only permitted means of cell change in this case . The three modes are 

The network may indicate that a CCN Cell Change Notification procedure should be performed by a particular mobile station or mobile stations generally in respect of certain neighbour cells or neighbour cells using a certain radio access technology RAT . Typically the network indicates that the Cell Change Notification procedure is to be performed through broadcast system information. However it may also be signalled using point to point signalling e.g. in a Packet Measurement Order PMO message . The existing fields to indicate this include 

With current definitions CCN is applicable only when the mobile station is in packet transfer mode and in either NC0 or NC1 mode.

If for the target cell for which reselection criteria are met CCN is active or enabled then the mobile station sends a Packet Cell Change Notification PCCN message to the network identifying the selected target cell before performing reselection.

a do nothing after timers elapse at the mobile station the mobile station will continue with reselection 

b order the mobile station to continue reselection to the selected cell by sending a Packet Cell Change Continue PCCC message a Packet Cell Change Order PCCO message may also be used in this case 

c order the mobile station to perform reselection to a different cell by sending a Packet Cell Change Order PCCO message 

d initiate a packet switched handover procedure this involves a preparation phase in which the target cell receives advance notification of the mobile station s intended cell change the target cell reserves resources and informs the mobile via the serving cell of these resources. This approach can reduce the service interruption time associated with cell change.

Before sending a PCCO or PCCC indicating a cell change to a GERAN cell the network may send neighbour cell system information to the mobile station. This may include some or all of the system information that the mobile station would otherwise need to receive in the target cell before establishing packet transfer mode. One of the benefits of the CCN procedure is to allow the mobile station to receive this information before performing reselection and hence to avoid needing to receive it in the target cell which may cause service interruption.

Before sending a packet switched handover command where the target cell is a GSM cell the network sends the neighbour cell system information.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure are provided below the disclosed systems and or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether or not currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

For the CCN mode and NC modes as currently specified there is no specific mention of uncontrolled cells in the specifications for CCN procedures or the definition of NC0 NC1 NC2. It is therefore implicit that the same procedures for example signaling procedures specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 apply for uncontrolled cells as for any other target cell of the same RAT.

A set of modes were described in the background namely NC0 NC1 NC2 and these are related to different modes levels of network control over mobile station cell change. These modes have been defined in respect of cells generally with no distinction between the cells being controlled or uncontrolled. These modes are specific examples of cell change network control modes. More generally a set of cell change network control modes encompasses a set of modes featuring differing network control and or mobile station autonomy with respect to cell reselection. The above described set of modes NC0 NC1 and NC2 is a specific example of a set of cell change network control modes. The embodiments described herein are not limited to this particular set.

Similarly the behaviour of the mobile station in terms of cell change notification is either CCN active or CCN enabled in which case cell change notification is performed or not in which case cell change notification is not performed. This has been defined in respect of cells generally with no distinction between the cells being controlled or uncontrolled. In the description of the embodiments that follow references to NCC notification of cell change mode refer generally to a mode of a mobile station in terms of whether a notification of a cell change is required to be sent to the serving cell in advance of performing a cell change in which case the NCC mode of mobile station is NCC required mode or is not required to be sent to the serving cell in advance of performing the cell change in which case the NCC mode of the mobile station is NCC not required mode. The above referenced CCN behaviour is a specific example of this which is detailed for example in 3GPP TS 44.060 but it is to be clearly understood that uses of NCC mode described herein are not limited to CCN behaviour thus defined.

In some embodiments a separate cell change network control mode setting is specified for uncontrolled cells and a separate NCC mode setting is specified for uncontrolled cells. The mode settings assignable for uncontrolled cells may be the same or different from the assignable modes defined for controlled cells. However this embodiment is in terms of the ultimate behaviour of the mobile station. It is not necessary that new modes be defined but simply that the mobile station does not apply the setting defined for controlled cells in respect of uncontrolled cells.

More generally an improved flexibility is provided such that at least one of the cell change network control mode and NCC mode applicable to a category of cell can be applied that is different from that signalled or otherwise specified already for cells of the same RAT. The defined category of cell may be based on one or more of 

In the description that follows cell controller is a generic term which could for example refer to base station controllers BSC radio network controllers RNC or eNodeB eNB or Home eNodeB generally for the purpose of this description it is used to mean an entity which controls the cell in some sense. For example a cell controller might be an entity which initiates a handover preparation procedure for a mobile station serving cell controller or which allocates resources in a target cell as part of a handover procedure target cell controller . The serving cell controller may for example be responsible for processing measurement reports cell change notifications and similar messages received from a mobile station and based on these and other implementation specific considerations generating mobility commands such as packet cell change order messages to be transmitted to the mobile station and or initiating handover preparation. A GERAN BSS is an example. The same entity or entities may function as a serving cell controller in respect of the cell when performing a serving cell role and a target cell controller when the same cell is performing a target cell role. A cell controller may perform the control function for one or multiple cells. In some cases a cell controller performs the control function for one cell and is co located with other cell components such as a component containing a wireless transceiver such as a base station. A cell controller may be a part of a BSS base station subsystem which includes the transceiver. References to a cell sending or receiving something refer to a wireless transceiver sending or receiving something possibly under control of the cell controller of the cell.

Referring to shown is a schematic diagram in which a mobile station has a wireless connection to a serving cell transceiver within serving cell . Also shown is a serving cell controller target cell transceiver within target cell and target cell controller . Of course other network elements may be present such as core network elements and other cell controllers . The core network elements may for example include one or more of an SGSN serving GPRS support node MSC mobile switching centre MME mobility management entity . The signalling over the air interface between a transceiver and a mobile station is typically performed at the RLC radio link control MAC medium access control layer. Signalling between a BSS and core network is separate from RLC MAC.

The serving cell controller is configured with a mobility control unit that enables the serving cell controller to perform one or a combination of two or more of the serving cell controller methods described herein. The mobility control unit may be implemented in hardware or software running on a processing platform such as a processor or combination of processors or a combination of hardware and software. The mobility control unit may be implemented as part of a change to another component forming part of a serving cell controller. The serving cell controller includes other components not shown to allow it to perform the serving cell controller functionality.

The target cell controller is configured with an inbound mobility controller that enables the target cell controller to perform one or a combination of two or more of the target cell controller methods described herein. The inbound mobility controller may be implemented in hardware or software running on a processing platform such as a processor or combination of processors or a combination of hardware and software. The inbound mobility controller may be implemented as part of a change to another component forming part of a target cell controller. The target cell controller includes other components not shown to allow it to perform the target cell controller functionality.

A cell controller may be implemented that includes both the mobility control unit and the inbound mobility controller .

The mobile station has at least one antenna and at least one wireless access radio . In addition the mobile station is configured with a cell change controller that enables the mobile station to perform one or a combination of two or more of the mobile station methods described herein. The cell change controller may be implemented in hardware or software running on a processing platform such as a processor or combination of processors or a combination of hardware and software. The cell change controller may be implemented as part of a change to another component forming part of a mobile station. The mobile station includes other components not shown to allow it to perform mobile station functionality.

Various embodiments that comprise methods implemented by a mobile station or cell controller will now be described with reference to . For each method unless clearly necessary for the method to function it is not necessary that the steps be executed in the sequence depicted or described.

Further embodiments provide computer readable media having computer executable instructions stored thereon that when executed by an appropriate processing device such as a mobile device or a cell controller execute any one or more of the methods described herein.

Detailed examples of the above described methods will now be described. The examples provided below provide for the definition of the notification configuration of the NCC mode and cell change network control mode for a defined category of cells such as uncontrolled cells as opposed to NCC mode and cell change network control mode for other cells for example controlled cells . In some embodiments respective notification configurations of the NCC mode and cell change network control mode are defined for each of a plurality of different categories of cells.

In some embodiments the behaviour of the mobile station is different for a defined category of cells than for other cells of the same RAT through specification of the mobile station. For such embodiments in general the mobile station is configured to perform a first behaviour in respect of NCC mode and cell change network control in response to signalling of NCC required mode and cell change network control in respect of some cells of a given RAT. In addition notwithstanding the signalling of NCC required mode and cell change network control in respect of some cells of a given RAT the mobile station performs a second behaviour in respect of NCC mode and cell change network control in respect of cells of a defined category of cells of the given RAT that differs from the first behaviour in some manner. Various specific examples follow.

In some embodiments the mobile station is configured to never enter NCC required mode nor to send a notification of cell change mode in respect of a defined category of cells for a given RAT such as uncontrolled cells notwithstanding the NCC mode or cell change network control mode defined for cells of the same RAT.

In some embodiments for a defined category of cells the mobile station is configured to obey the NCC mode signalled for other cells of the same RAT. For autonomous reselection the mobile station is configured to perform in a defined manner for example so as to allow autonomous reselection irrespective of the cell change network control mode signalled for other cells.

In some embodiments for a defined category of cells the mobile station is configured to obey the cell change network control mode signalled for other cells of the same RAT. For NCC mode the mobile station is configured to behave in a defined manner for example so as to always send an NCC or never to send an NCC irrespective of the NCC mode signalled for other cells.

In some embodiments for a defined category of cells the signalling transmitted for other cells is used one or both of NCC mode and cell change network control . However the behaviour specified by the signalling is different in respect of cells of the defined category than for other cells.

In some embodiments the second behaviour involves for a defined category of cells of a given RAT performing at least one of autonomous reselection and notification of cell change notwithstanding one or both of signalled NCC required mode and cell change network control for some cells of the given RAT.

In some embodiments new indications are defined to explicitly signal a desired behaviour in terms of notification of cell change and or cell change network control mode. These indications may be transmitted as part of broadcast system information or may be transmitted point to point. In some embodiments a separate indication for each of NCC mode and cell change network control mode is used. In some embodiments a single indication conveys both NCC mode and cell change network control mode. These indications may be broadcast for example through system information or may be transmitted point to point. In some embodiments at least one indication is sent that is further to indication s sent for other cells to signal a desired behaviour in respect of some cells in terms of at least one of NCC mode and cell change network control mode.

In a first specific example a first new field is defined to indicate a cell change network control mode applicable for the defined category of cells. In another example a second new field is defined to indicate whether NCC is required for the defined category of cells. One or both of the first new field and the second new field may be implemented. In some embodiments a single field indicates both the cell change network control mode and the NCC mode for the defined category of cells.

In a specific example for the cell change network control mode a new field is referred to as NC MODE CSG E UTRAN in the detailed example below that might be defined for target E UTRAN uncontrolled cells. In another example a new field is defined to indicate whether NCC is required for target E UTRAN uncontrolled cells. In some embodiments a field or fields similar to those defined above are defined for UTRAN uncontrolled cells.

In some embodiments the desired behaviour in respect of a defined category of cells in terms of notification of cell change and or cell change network control mode is implicitly signalled for example based on a combination of other fields capabilities. This signalling may be broadcast for example through system information or may be transmitted point to point.

In some embodiments the NCC mode and cell change network control mode for a defined category of cells such as uncontrolled cells is determined as a function of the indications of NCC mode and cell change network notification mode for other cells such as controlled cells in combination with at least one other criterion. The at least one other criterion may for example involve the transmission of a further indication that is specific to the defined category of cells or capabilities of the serving cell and or target cell controllers such as BSS HeNB HNB to name a few specific examples.

In a first example the desired cell change network control mode and NCC mode for the defined category of cells is based on the current applicable cell change network control mode for controlled cells and or the current NCC mode applicable for other cells for example controlled cells in combination with whether or not the serving cell controller supports handover to cells of the defined category or more generally in combination with whether or not handover from the serving cell to cells of the defined category is supported by the network where network refers to any appropriate entity other than the mobile station. The MS may learn the behaviour of the current serving cell in this regard for example by means of broadcast system information or point to point signaling e.g. in PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER messages or both.

A second example which is specific to the above described NC0 NC1 and NC2 cell change network control modes and CCN behaviour will now be described. The desired cell change network control mode for uncontrolled cells is defined to be the same as the current applicable cell change network control mode for controlled cells if the current cell change network control mode is NC0 or NC1. Where the cell change network control mode for controlled cells is NC2 another new field is employed example is CSG NC2 defined in detail below which specifies how the mobile station is to behave in respect of uncontrolled cells if NC2 is applicable for controlled cells. In a particular example the new field selectively indicates one of 

In another example a new field referred to as CSG CCN in the detailed example below is used to specify how the mobile station is to behave in respect of a defined category of cells if notification of cell change is required for other cells. In a particular example the new field selectively indicates one of 

NCCS NCC notification of cell change sent mode refers to a mode or state of a mobile station after having sent a notification of cell change. In a specific example after having sent a PCCN a mobile station is referred to as being in CCN mode . In some embodiments the behaviour of the mobile station in terms of NCC and or cell change network control is also a function of whether the mobile station is in NCCS mode. As above the behaviour may be defined to be different for different defined categories of cells considering one or both of the category of the currently considered target cell and the category of the cell in respect of which the NCC was sent. For example the behaviour defined for CSG cells while in NCCS mode for a non CSG cell may be defined differently to behaviour defined for 2G cells while in NCCS mode for a 3G cell.

In some embodiments the behaviour in terms of the possibility to perform autonomous reselection and whether such reselection is to be notified in advance to the network may also take account of whether there is handover support with respect to the serving cell and or the target cell. Mechanisms for learning whether handover is supported in respect of a target cell are provided in co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12 690 803 filed the same day as this application entitled Systems and Methods For Informing Serving Cell of Target Cell Handover Capability 52404 287 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. For example if packet switched handover is known not to be possible because either or both of the serving cell controller and target cell controller do not support the feature then the mobile station may be permitted to perform autonomous reselection to the target cell without sending a notification to the serving cell regardless of cell change network control mode and whether or not notification of cell change is required for other cells for example even when in a cell change network control mode that otherwise prohibits such autonomous reselection and or when in NCC required mode.

The approaches described may provide more flexibility for the operator in terms of controlling mobility towards controlled and uncontrolled cells potentially taking into account the different mobility mechanisms supported for controlled and uncontrolled target cells. The approaches may reduce signalling for example of PCCN PCCO PCCC and or delay when network behaviour would otherwise be to always accept a proposed cell change towards an uncontrolled cell. The approaches may avoid unnecessary signalling in the case where handover is not possible.

A first parameter is used to indicate whether a mobile station should notify the serving cell controller of a cell change prior to performing the cell change for example through a cell change notification procedure for example to enter CCN mode for cells for example of a given RAT. The first parameter applies to cells other than cells of a defined category or categories unless otherwise indicated by the second parameter introduced below. Examples of defined categories include uncontrolled cells 3G CSG cells E UTRAN CSG cells.

A second parameter is used to indicate whether the first parameter also applies to cells of the defined category.

The parameters introduced above may be sent as part of system information broadcast to all mobile stations or as part of a mobile station specific message.

Network Behaviour Inform Mobile Station of Cell Change Network Control for a Defined Category of Cells

The following two paragraphs are about cell change network control mode. This may control both measurement reporting and whether autonomous reselection is permitted. If it is permitted then the CCN mode setting indicates whether it is required to notify the network in such case.

In some embodiments a first parameter is used to request a mobile station to send measurement reports in respect of a set of cells for example controlled cells of for example a given RAT. A second parameter is sent to indicate whether the first parameter also applies to cells of a defined category of the given RAT for example uncontrolled cells.

In some embodiments if the second parameter is set to a first value then the first parameter applies to target cells of the defined category and the mobile station sends measurement reports accordingly. If the second parameter is set to a second value then the mobile station performs autonomous reselection to cells of the defined category and does not include measurements of these cells in measurement reports.

Upon receiving a parameter s that indicate to the mobile station to notify the serving cell of a cell change for an uncontrolled cell the mobile station performs such notification although other criteria may also be imposed.

A message such as an SI2quater message may also contain the 3G CCN ACTIVE parameter in order to indicate whether the MS shall perform the CCN procedures in the serving cell when re selecting to a 3G neighbour cell see 3GPP TS 44.060. In some embodiments the 3G CCN ACTIVE parameter is used to indicate if CCN is activated in serving cell towards 3G neighbour cells other than those known to be CSG cells it applies also to 3G CSG cells if indicated by the 3G CSG CCN ACTIVE parameter.

The SI2quater message may also contain the E UTRAN CCN ACTIVE parameter in order to indicate whether the MS shall perform the CCN procedures in the serving cell when re selecting to an E UTRAN neighbour cell see 3GPP TS 44.060.

In some embodiments the E UTRAN CCN ACTIVE parameter is used to indicate if CCN is activated in the serving cell towards E UTRAN neighbour cells other than those known to be CSG cells it applies also to E UTRAN CSG cells if indicated by the EUTRAN CSG CCN ACTIVE parameter.

A mobile station which has CCN Enabled a specific example of NCC required can enter CCN Mode CCN mode being the mode of a mobile station that has transmitted a PCCN . The mobile station shall enable CCN when the following criteria are fulfilled 

The CCN procedures and the criteria for entering and leaving CCN mode are specified in sub clauses 8.8.2 and 8.8.3. of 3GPP TS 44.060.

The network may request measurement reports from the mobile station and control its cell re selection. This is indicated by the parameter NETWORK CONTROL ORDER. The meaning of the different parameter values is specified as follows 

The parameter values NC1 and NC2 only apply in GMM Ready state A Gb mode or RRC Cell Shared state Iu mode . In GMM Standby state A Gb mode or RRC Idle mode or RRC GRA PCH state Iu mode the MS shall always use normal MS control independent of the ordered NC mode.

A set of measurement reporting parameters including NETWORK CONTROL ORDER is broadcast on BCCH and excepting E UTRAN parameters on PBCCH if it exists. This set of parameters may also be sent individually to an MS on PACCH or excepting E UTRAN parameters on PCCCH in 

The individual parameters are valid until the RESET command is sent to the MS or there is a downlink signalling failure or a random access failure or if the cell is barred or the C1 criterion falls below zero or the MS goes to the GMM Standby state A Gb mode or RRC Idle mode or RRC GRA PCH state Iu mode or MS enters dedicated mode A Gb mode or RRC Cell Dedicated state Iu mode . Before the MS has acquired NC parameters when entering a new cell the MS shall assume mode NC0 unless NC0 NC1 or NC2 mode was explicitly commanded by a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message in the previous cell.

All signalling for support of network controlled cell re selection and measurement reports are defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.

The NETWORK CONTROL ORDER parameter applies to reselection to E UTRAN respectively 3G CSG cells only if EUTRAN CSG NETWORK CONTROL respectively 3G CSG NETWORK CONTROL is set to 1 . If EUTRAN CSG NETWORK CONTROL respectively 3G CSG NETWORK CONTROL is set to 0 then the mobile station shall behave as if in NC0 in respect of E UTRAN respectively 3G CSG cells i.e.

In some embodiments the mobile station does not enter CCN mode if the target cell is known to be a cell of a defined category such as an uncontrolled cell.

A mobile station which has CCN Enabled can enter CCN Mode CCN mode being a state or mode of operation of the mobile station upon having sent a PCCN.

A Network Informs Mobile Station Whether Automomous Selection to Cells of Defined Category while in NCC Sent Mode

NCCS NCC sent mode refers to a mode or state of a mobile station after having sent a NCC. In a specific example after having sent a PCCN a mobile station is referred to as being in CCN mode . In some embodiments the network sends a parameter to the mobile station to indicate to the mobile station whether autonomous selection to a cell of a defined category while in NCCS mode is permitted. A detailed example of this approach is provided below.

In some embodiments if the strongest cell as suitably defined see 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for an example definition of the strongest cell which the MS has detected on a given frequency of a RAT for example UTRAN or E UTRAN is a suitable cell of a defined category for example an uncontrolled cell for example a suitable CSG cell see 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for an example of suitability criteria for UTRAN and E UTRAN CSG cells respectively the mobile station reselects to the cell if it is not in NCCS mode or is not prohibited from performing autonomous reselection to such while in NCCS mode for example due to having received from the network the above introduced parameter that indicates to the mobile station whether autonomous selection to a cell of a defined category while in NCCS mode is permitted for example by an appropriate setting of the CCN CSG RESEL parameter introduced below. A detailed example of this approach is provided below.

In some embodiments while in NCCS mode the mobile station continues a data transfer and stores neighbour cell system information if received for example in instances of a PACKET NEIGHBOUR CELL DATA message. However the mobile station does not perform any cell change to a cell of a defined category for example an uncontrolled cell for example a CSG cell unless autonomous cell changes to such cells during NCCS mode are permitted for example due to having received from the network the above introduced parameter that indicates to the mobile station whether autonomous selection to a cell of a defined category while in NCCS mode is permitted for example by an appropriate setting of the CCN CSG RESEL parameter introduced below. In this case the mobile station may send a further notification of cell change for example a PCCN indicating the target cell leave NCCS mode and perform the cell change. A detailed example of this approach is provided below. If such reselection occurs the MS may stop any applicable timers and leave NCCS mode.

In some embodiments one of the behaviours A B C is implemented. In some embodiments two of the behaviours A B C are implemented. In some embodiments all of the behaviours A B C are implemented.

Network Informs Mobile Station Whether Automomous Selection to Cells of Defined Category while in NCCS Mode is Permitted Detailed Example

A detailed example follows in terms of additions to the SI 2quater Rest Octets defined for example in 3GPP TS 44.060 v.9.2.0 3GPP TS 45.008 v.9.1.0 or 3GPP TS 44.018 v.9.3.0. Only excerpts are shown. The added parameter is referred to as CCN CSG RESEL. A similar parameter may be implemented in another message for CSG cells or for another category of cells.

The SI 2quater Rest Octets information element contains neighbour cell lists for UTRAN and or E UTRAN cells and or CSG cells. For cell reselection to UTRAN it is used with the SI 2ter Rest Octets information to build the 3G Cell Reselection list see sub clause 3.4.1.2.1.7. For cell reselection to E UTRAN it is used directly to build the E UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.

The SI 2quater Rest Octets information element is a type 5 information element with 20 octet length. The following field is included 

CCN CSG RESEL 1 bit field If this bit is set to 1 autonomous reselection to CSG cells is permitted while in CCN mode see 3GPP TS 44.060 . If set to 0 autonomous reselection to CSG cells is not permitted while in CCN mode.

If a mobile station is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group i.e. at least one CSG ID is included in the MS s CSG Whitelist then in addition to normal cell reselection the MS shall use an autonomous search function for UTRAN and or E UTRAN CSG cells.

If the strongest cell see 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for the definition of the strongest cell which the MS has detected on a UTRAN or E UTRAN frequency is a suitable CSG cell see 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for suitability criteria for UTRAN and E UTRAN CSG cells respectively it should reselect to this cell if it is not currently in CCN mode or is not prohibited from performing autonomous reselection to CSG cells while in CCN mode see 3GPP TS 44.060 .

If CCN is enabled towards the target cell see sub clause 5.5.1.1a and 3GPP TS 44.160 the mobile station shall behave as in network control mode NC0 or NC1 up to the point when a new cell has been chosen. If the target cell is a GSM cell the mobile station shall then check the CCN SUPPORTED parameter if available that was last received for that cell. This parameter can be sent on BCCH or PBCCH or individually in PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER or PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER or PS HANDOVER COMMAND messages.

If for a GSM cell the CCN SUPPORTED parameter is available and if it indicates that CCN mode shall not be entered towards that cell then the mobile station shall perform the cell change and not enter CCN mode. If the cell reselection is triggered by the path loss criterion parameter C1 becoming negative the mobile station may perform the cell change without entering the CCN mode.

If the target cell is a GSM cell and the CCN SUPPORTED parameter is available and if it indicates that CCN mode shall be entered towards that cell or if the CCN SUPPORTED parameter is not available then instead of performing the cell change the mobile station shall start timer T3206 and enter the CCN mode. At the first possible opportunity the MS shall then when in CCN mode inform the network about the proposed target cell by sending a PACKET CELL CHANGE NOTIFICATION message stop timer T3206 start timers T3208 and T3210.

If the target cell is a 3G cell and if CCN is activated towards 3G cells or if the target cell is an E UTRAN cell and the mobile station supports CCN towards E UTRAN E UTRAN Neighbour Cell measurement reporting and Network controlled cell reselection to E UTRAN and if CCN is activated towards E UTRAN cells then instead of performing the cell change the mobile station shall start timer T3206 and enter the CCN mode. At the first possible opportunity the MS shall then when in CCN mode inform the network about the proposed target cell by sending a PACKET CELL CHANGE NOTIFICATION message stop timer T3206 start timers T3208 and T3210.

If the target cell is a GAN cell and the CCN SUPPORTED parameter is available and if it indicates that CCN mode shall be entered towards that cell or if the CCN SUPPORTED parameter is not available then instead of performing the cell change the mobile station shall start timer T3206 and enter the CCN mode. At the first possible opportunity a mobile station may when in CCN mode send a PACKET CELL CHANGE NOTIFICATION message that includes the ARFCN BSIC for the GAN cell and indicates an RXLEV of 63 for the GAN cell and start timers T3208 and T3210.

In CCN mode the mobile station shall continue the data transfer and store neighbour cell system information if received in instances of the PACKET NEIGHBOUR CELL DATA message but not perform any cell change unless autonomous cell changes to CSG cells during CCN mode are permitted see CCN CSG RESEL parameter in 3GPP TS 44.018 in which case the mobile station shall send a further PACKET CELL CHANGE NOTIFICATION indicating a target CSG cell leave CCN mode and perform the cell change.

The mobile station shall leave CCN mode when either CCN is no longer enabled towards all GSM 3G or E UTRAN neighbour cells with the CCN ACTIVE 3G CCN ACTIVE E UTRAN CCN ACTIVE bit or towards the cell that had been re selected or when the network has responded with a PACKET CELL CHANGE CONTINUE or PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message or a PS HANDOVER COMMAND message or when either of the timers T3206 or T3208 have expired or on reselection to a CSG cell if permitted .

If the mobile station has been individually ordered to enable CCN the order is only valid within the cell where the order is given. When a cell change has been performed using the cell reselection procedure the mobile station shall use CCN in the new cell only if individually ordered in the previous cell with the PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message or if individually ordered or broadcast in the new cell. When a cell change has been performed using the PS handover procedure the mobile station shall enable CCN in the new cell only if individually ordered in the previous cell with the PS HANDOVER COMMAND message or if individually ordered or broadcast in the new cell.

If the cell reselection criteria have changed during the time the MS is in CCN mode but the path loss criterion parameter C1 remains positive the MS shall without notifying the network about the new preferred cell remain in CCN mode until the criteria for CCN mode are no longer fulfilled unless otherwise specified above. When leaving CCN mode the MS shall obey the new criteria according to the normal rules as specified in sub clause 5.5.1.1 and 3GPP TS 44.160 and in 3GPP TS 45.008 unless a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER or a PS HANDOVER COMMAND message has been received see bullet 3 above . If the path loss criterion parameter C1 becomes negative while the MS is in CCN mode the MS may leave the CCN mode without notifying the network and perform the cell change.

A packet cell change notification is a message from a mobile station to a serving cell indicating that the mobile station is about to perform a cell change. If the packet cell change is not permitted in some embodiments by not responding to the packet cell change notification the serving cell indicates to the mobile station that the reselection is not permitted. In some embodiments the mobile station is configured to treat the absence of a response to a packet cell change notification as an indication that the mobile station may not perform its intended reselection. In some embodiments such a configuration only applies for a particular type of cells such as uncontrolled cells or a particular type of uncontrolled cells. This approach may be applied to PCCN Packet Cell Change Notification such as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060 but more generally may be defined to apply to any message whose purpose is to notify the serving cell of a packet cell change.

In some embodiments a new message the Packet Cell Change Prohibited message defined in detail below is defined to indicate explicitly that the desired reselection as indicated by for example a packet cell change notification message sent by the device is not permitted. An example message format example is provided below. The message may for example be sent on a PACCH packet associated control channel . In some embodiments the message is a distribution message in the sense that that all mobile stations which receive it should process it and obey the restriction. In this case the message may identify a particular cell to which the restriction applies. Alternatively the message can be mobile station specific in which case it may not be necessary to identify the individual cell to which the message applies as the mobile station will be aware of the cell.

In some embodiments when a mobile station receives such a message in response to a packet cell change notification the mobile station does not perform autonomous reselection to the cell indicated in the packet cell change notification or to any other cells if any indicated in the message.

In some embodiments where a message is sent to indicate that the desired reselection is not permitted further information is added to the message. One or more of the following mechanisms may be provided 

a In some embodiments the message includes an indication of whether the restriction applies to all potential target cells i.e. autonomous reselection is completely prohibited in which case the mobile station is not permitted to send any further packet cell change notification message while the restriction applies. b In some embodiments the message includes an indication that the restriction applies to a particular subset of cells e.g. uncontrolled cells CSG cells non CSG cells cells using a particular RAT operating on a particular frequency or any combination of these . In such cases notwithstanding the restriction the mobile may send a packet cell change notification for a controlled cell. In a specific example cells are classified by CSG non CSG and by RAT. c In some embodiments the message includes an indication that the restriction applies only to the indicated cell. In this case the mobile may send a packet cell change notification for any other cell. Timers to Prevent Multiple Packet Cell Change Notifications Indicating the Same Cell

In some embodiments a timer is used to prevent the mobile station from sending a packet cell change notification indicating the same cell for a time period after a previous indication was made and not permitted as determined from one of the above mechanisms for example. The timer may start either when the packet cell change notification was sent or when the mobile station determined that the cell change was not permitted different time limits may apply depending on the method used to prevent reselection. In some embodiments a field representing a value for the timer is included in the packet cell change prohibited message. In some embodiments a default timer value is applied when none is specified in the message.

In some embodiments different time limits are applied depending on the number of previously sent packet cell change notifications for that cell e.g. shorter times for initial transmissions longer times for subsequent transmissions to account for the possibility that an initial transmission was not received correctly by the network.

The following is a specific detailed example of the above described approach in terms of changes underlined to 3GPP TS 44.060 Sub clause 8.8.3 Cell Change Notification procedure.

After receiving a PACKET CELL CHANGE NOTIFICATION message from the mobile station the network can behave in different ways as described below 

Referring now to shown is a block diagram of another mobile station that is configured to perform one or a combination of the mobile station implemented methods described in this disclosure. The mobile station is shown with a cell change controller for implementing features similar to those of the cell change controller of the mobile station of . It is to be understood that the mobile station is shown with very specific details for exemplary purposes only.

A processing device a microprocessor is shown schematically as coupled between a keyboard and a display . The microprocessor controls operation of the display as well as overall operation of the mobile station in response to actuation of keys on the keyboard by a user.

The mobile station has a housing that may be elongated vertically or may take on other sizes and shapes including clamshell housing structures . The keyboard may include a mode selection key or other hardware or software for switching between text entry and telephony entry.

In addition to the microprocessor other parts of the mobile station are shown schematically. These include a communications subsystem a short range communications subsystem the keyboard and the display along with other input output devices including a set of LEDs a set of auxiliary I O devices a serial port a speaker and a microphone as well as memory devices including a flash memory and a Random Access Memory RAM and various other device subsystems . The mobile station may have a battery to power the active elements of the mobile station . The mobile station is in some embodiments a two way radio frequency RF communication device having voice and data communication capabilities. In addition the mobile station in some embodiments has the capability to communicate with other computer systems via the Internet.

Operating system software executed by the microprocessor is in some embodiments stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory but may be stored in other types of memory devices such as a read only memory ROM or similar storage element. In addition system software specific device applications or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Communication signals received by the mobile station may also be stored to the RAM .

The microprocessor in addition to its operating system functions enables execution of software applications on the mobile station . A predetermined set of software applications that control basic device operations such as a voice communications module A and a data communications module B may be installed on the mobile station during manufacture. In addition a personal information manager PIM application module C may also be installed on the mobile station during manufacture. The PIM application is in some embodiments capable of organizing and managing data items such as e mail calendar events voice mails appointments and task items. The PIM application is also in some embodiments capable of sending and receiving data items via a wireless network . In some embodiments the data items managed by the PIM application are seamlessly integrated synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the device user s corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. As well additional software modules illustrated as another software module N may be installed during manufacture.

Communication functions including data and voice communications are performed through the communication subsystem and possibly through the short range communications subsystem . The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and one or more antennas illustrated as a receive antenna and a transmit antenna . In addition the communication subsystem also includes a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP and local oscillators LOs . The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem is dependent upon the communication network in which the mobile station is intended to operate. For example the communication subsystem of the mobile station may be designed to operate with the Mobitex DataTAC or General Packet Radio Service GPRS mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service AMPS Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Personal Communications Service PCS Global System for Mobile Communications GSM etc. Examples of CDMA include 1 and 1 EV DO. The communication subsystem may also be designed to operate with an 802.11 Wi Fi network and or an 802.16 WiMAX network. Other types of data and voice networks both separate and integrated may also be utilized with the mobile station .

Network access may vary depending upon the type of communication system. For example in the Mobitex and DataTAC networks mobile stations are registered on the network using a unique Personal Identification Number PIN associated with each device. In GPRS networks however network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore typically has a subscriber identity module commonly referred to as a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card in order to operate on a GPRS network.

When network registration or activation procedures have been completed the mobile station may send and receive communication signals over the communication network . Signals received from the communication network by the receive antenna are routed to the receiver which provides for signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog to digital conversion of the received signal allows the DSP to perform more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner signals to be transmitted to the network are processed e.g. modulated and encoded by the DSP and are then provided to the transmitter for digital to analog conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the communication network or networks via the transmit antenna .

In addition to processing communication signals the DSP provides for control of the receiver and the transmitter . For example gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

In a data communication mode a received signal such as a text message or web page download is processed by the communication subsystem and is input to the microprocessor . The received signal is then further processed by the microprocessor for an output to the display or alternatively to some other auxiliary I O devices . A device user may also compose data items such as e mail messages using the keyboard and or some other auxiliary I O device such as a touchpad a rocker switch a thumb wheel or some other type of input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over the communication network via the communication subsystem .

In a voice communication mode overall operation of the device is substantially similar to the data communication mode except that received signals are output to a speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile station . In addition the display may also be utilized in voice communication mode for example to display the identity of a calling party the duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The short range communications subsystem enables communication between the mobile station and other proximate systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communications subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that a mobile device may sometimes be treated as a combination of a separate ME mobile equipment device and an associated removable memory module. Accordingly for purpose of the present disclosure the terms mobile device and communications device are each treated as representative of both ME devices alone as well as the combinations of ME devices with removable memory modules as applicable.

Also note that a communication device might be capable of operating in multiple modes such that it can engage in both CS Circuit Switched as well as PS Packet Switched communications and can transit from one mode of communications to another mode of communications without loss of continuity. Other implementations are possible.

Some of the embodiments described can be implemented in the context of one or more of the following standards all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety 

Numerous modifications and variations of the present disclosure are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the disclosure may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
