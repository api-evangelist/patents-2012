Advertisements with higher ad scores may generate more advertising revenue for social networking system as a publisher of the advertisements which social networking system may share with users carriers or both. An ad score for an advertisement may be based on user location social graph connections or other social graph information or other suitable factors. In addition or as an alternative an ad score for an advertisement may be based on the bid amount for the advertisement and a probability that a user will select e.g. click the advertisement as presented. In addition or as a further alternative the ad score may be based on a quality score the bid amount for the advertisement and user profile or other information associated with the user. For example the value AdScore may be calculated using the equation AdScore WQuality WBid WValueToUser. Although a particular mathematical expression is shown AdScore may be calculated using any suitable mathematical expressions including any suitable mathematical functions.

In the equation above W W and Wmay be weight variables. Quality may be a quality score calculated for each advertisement. The quality score may represent a correlation between the advertisement that is being presented and a web page or one or more attributes of the web page that the advertisement is being presented on. In addition or as an alternative the quality score may represent an observed click through rate for the advertisement. In addition or as another alternative the quality score may represent a dynamic fit between the advertisement and user profile information associated with a user that the advertisement would be presented to. Bid may be the bid amount for the advertisement which as discussed above may include an advertisement bid component and a social pay bid component . ValueToUser which may be affected by the social pay bid component of the bid for the advertisement may be a value associated with user profile or other information associated with the user that the advertisement would be presented to including a current context of the user. A current context of a user may include the user s current location the user s current relationship to one or more other users such as for example a physical proximity of the user to one or more other users or current sensor data from one or more sensors on a client system of the user. In addition or as an alternative a current context of a user may include one or more weather inputs which may indicate the current weather conditions the user is experiencing how the user is interacting with a client system other computing device or software or services associated with for example social networking system or a third party system or other current context of the user. An advertisement that is more relevant to a current context of a user may be more relevant interesting or valuable to the user. In addition or as an alternative particular embodiments may use one or more systems or methods for bidding on or delivering advertisements disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 294 052 entitled Multi Dimensional Advertisement Bidding and filed 10 Nov. 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference as an example and not by way of limitation.

When selecting among multiple advertisements for delivery to a user social networking system may select the advertisement with the highest ad score. When selected the advertisement may be delivered to the user for example as text which may be HTML linked as one or more images which may be HTML linked as one or more videos as audio as one or more ADOBE FLASH files as a suitable combination of these or as any other suitable advertisement in any suitable digital format on a web page of social networking system or a third party system accessed by the user on client system . In addition or as an alternative the advertisement may be delivered to an application on client system for the application to present to the user. For example the advertisement may be delivered to a FACEBOOK MOBILE application on client system to be presented to the user in a graphical user interface GUI of the application. The advertisement may be stored at social networking system or a third party system and may be delivered to the user in a push or pull communication with client system . As an example the advertisement may be a sponsored story in a news feed that social networking system provides to the user. Social networking system may deliver the sponsored story to the user in a notification pushed by social networking system to client system . Client system may present the sponsored story to the user in a news feed of social networking system . As another example the advertisement may be a sponsored story in a ticker that social networking system provides to the user. Social networking system may deliver the sponsored story to the user in a communication sent by social networking system to client system in response to a request a pull from client system . Client system may present the sponsored story to the user in a ticker of social networking system .

At step social networking system determines the occurrence of a reward generating event associated with the advertisement. A reward generating event may include an impression click click through or other suitable user interaction with the advertisement and may occur at least in part on client system social networking system third party system or a suitable combination of these. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular reward generating events this disclosure contemplates any suitable reward generating events.

As an example of a reward generating event consider a user at a client system navigating a web site of social networking system . A carrier provides network connectivity to client system facilitating navigation of the web site by the user. The user may request a web page of the web site and social networking system may select an advertisement for presentation on the web page to the user. As discussed above the advertisement may be selected based on an ad score for the advertisement that is associated with the user. The web page may be served with the advertisement to client system for presentation to the user. All or a portion of the web page and the advertisement may be served through the network connectivity provided by the carrier. When presented with the web page with the advertisement the user may view and click the advertisement. In response client system may be directed to a landing page for the advertisement which may be hosted by a third party system . The user may then purchase a widget at the landing page or another web page associated with the landing page. The impression of the advertisement the user clicking on it or the purchase by the user may individually or collectively be a reward generating event. After the purchase third party system may generate a reward generating event message and send it to social networking system . The reward generating event message may identify the advertisement the bid for the advertisement the carrier third party system client system the user or the type of action that occurred. Social networking system may determine whether the user is a member of social networking system and if so then store information about the reward generating event in a reward generating event log maintained by social networking system . Social networking system may determine whether the user is a member of social networking system without sharing any of personal information of the user or requiring the user to log on to social networking system and the information about the reward generating event stored by social networking system may include all or some of the information in the reward generating event message. Although this disclosure describes a particular scenario with a particular reward generating event this disclosure contemplates any suitable scenario with any suitable reward generating event. As an example an impression may by itself e.g. without a user clicking the advertisement constitute a reward generating event. As another example a notification pushed to a client system may constitute a reward generating event.

At step social networking system allocates the bid amount associated with the advertisement including the advertisement bid component and the social pay bid component among itself the user and the carrier at which point the method may end. As described above the advertisement bid component may be a first monetary amount that the advertiser is willing to pay to a publisher for the advertisement which in this case is social networking system and the social pay bid component may be a second monetary amount that the advertiser is willing to pay the user carrier or both for the reward generating event. The value to the user may be determined based on a kick back provided to the user for a reward generating event whatever the reward may be. Social networking system may allocate the advertisement bid component to itself as the publisher. Social networking system may also allocate the social pay bid component to itself. As an alternative social networking system may allocate a portion of the social pay bid component e.g. 50 of it to the user and another portion of the social pay bid component the remaining 50 of it to the carrier. As another alternative social networking system may allocate all of the social pay bid component to the user or all of the social pay bid component to the carrier. The value to the user may be determined based on a kick back provided to the user for a reward generating event whatever the reward may be. As yet another alternative social networking system may refund all or a portion of the social pay bid component to the advertiser. All though this disclosure describes or illustrates particular allocations of a particular bid amount associated with a particular advertisement this disclosure contemplates any suitable allocations of any suitable bid amounts associated with any suitable advertisements.

The amount allocated to the user or carrier may be specified at least in part by the bid for the advertisement by an agreement between social networking system and the user such as the terms of use of social networking system by an agreement between social networking system and the advertiser other than the bid by an agreement between social networking system and the carrier by another suitable source or by a suitable combination of these. As an example the bid for the advertisement may specify in connection with the social pay bid component that 0.10 is to be paid to the user for the reward generating event and that 0.01 is to be paid to the carrier for the reward generating event. Social networking system may allocate the social pay bid component accordingly. The value to the user may be determined based on a kick back provided to the user for a reward generating event whatever the reward may be. As another example the bid for the advertisement may specify in connection with the social pay bid component that 0.10 is to be allocated between the user and carrier for the reward generating event with the allocation to be determined by social networking system . Social networking system may have an agreement with the user specifying that social networking system shall pay the user 90 of any social pay component for any reward generating event associated with the user e.g. caused by the user . Social networking system may have an agreement with the carrier specifying that social networking system shall pay the carrier 10 of any social pay component for a reward generating event associated with the carrier e.g. that the carrier facilitates by network connectivity provided by it . Accordingly social networking system may allocate 0.09 of the social pay bid component to the user and 0.01 of the social pay bid component to the carrier. The value to the user may be determined based on a kick back provided to the user for a reward generating event whatever the reward may be.

Moreover the amounts or relative percentages of the amounts allocated to the user or carrier may be determined at least in part based on the action s constituting the reward generating event. As an example if the reward generating event is only an impression of the advertisement social networking system may keep the social pay bid component and not allocate any of it to the user of carrier. As another example if the reward generating event is a selection of the advertisement by the user e.g. the user clicks the advertisement after being presented with it but the user does not perform any action at a landing page following the selection of the advertisement e.g. making a purchase or filling out and submitting a form social networking system may allocate 50 of the social pay bid component to the user and keep the rest without allocating any of the social pay bid component to the carrier. The value to the user may be determined based on a kick back provided to the user for a reward generating event whatever the reward may be. As yet another example if the reward generating event is an action following a selection of the advertisement by the user e.g. the user clicks the advertisement after being presented with it navigates to a landing page and then makes a purchase at the landing page social networking system may allocate 90 of the social pay bid component to the user and 10 of the social pay bid component to the carrier. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular amounts allocated to the user or carrier being specified by or determined based on particular sources or factors this disclosure contemplates any suitable amounts allocated to the user or carrier being specified by or determined based on any suitable sources or factors.
