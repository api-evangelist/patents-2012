This application is a continuation of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 557 865 filed on Nov. 8 2006 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains or may contain material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the photocopy reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

Various slot gaming machines are known. Slot gaming machines generally include a plurality of reels. Each reel includes a plurality of symbols. The reels spin after a player places a wager on the game. The reels spin and then stop to display generated combinations of symbols on the reels. If a generated symbol or combination of symbols is a winning symbol or combination of symbols associated with an award the player receives that award when the generated symbol or combination of symbols appears along an active payline associated with the reels or in a scatter pay. Certain players become frustrated if they almost win an award when the symbols necessary for a winning combination substantially appear on the reels but are missing a symbol or are not in the proper configuration or order to produce a winning combination.

One popular game feature which attempts to resolve such frustration in these situations and increase the player s award opportunities is a wild symbol. A wild symbol changes replaces or functions as one of the symbols on one of the reels after the reels initially spin and stop. This enables the game to change a first or non winning combination of symbols to a second and possibly winning combination of symbols e.g. to make a winning combination or align a winning combination on an active payline . In other variations the wild symbol may move or roam from one symbol position to another symbol position.

There is a continuing need for other ways of manipulating the position of wild symbols on the reels to create winning combinations on the reels. There is also a need for new and different games which employ reels.

One embodiment of the gaming device and method disclosed herein has a plurality of reels and at least one expanding and roaming wild symbol or wild symbol set. The expanding and roaming wild symbol or wild symbol set moves relative to the reels to provide a player with additional opportunities to win an award. When the wild symbol appears on one of the reels the wild symbol expands if one of a plurality of designated trigger symbols also appear on one of the reels. That is the wild symbol expands along the same reel e.g. to generate a plurality of individual wild symbols along the reel . In one embodiment the plurality of wild symbols along the reel form the expanded wild symbol set. Each wild symbol set causes each symbol on the reel to act as a wild symbol. Each designated trigger symbol is associated with or determines the number of rolls i.e. the number of times the expanded wild reel will roam or roll across the reels . A plurality of designated trigger symbols are associated with different numbers of rolls or moves. For each roll the expanded wild symbol set moves left to right or right to left to one of the reels. The reel to which the expanded wild symbol or the expanded wild symbol set moves is randomly determined in one embodiment. That is the expanded wild symbol set enables a plurality of wild symbols to randomly move or roll from reel to reel for a number of rolls or moves wherein the number is determined based at least in part on the designated trigger symbol. After each roll the gaming device performs an award evaluation during which the gaming device determines whether one or more winning combinations are displayed on the reels. One or more awards are associated with the winning combinations and one of such awards is provided to the player when the associated winning combination is displayed on the reels. The expanding and roaming wild symbol or wild symbol set generates more winning combinations for players of the gaming device and gives such players a better chance of obtaining awards while playing the gaming device.

In one alternative embodiment at least one designated trigger symbol is associated with or determines different numbers of rolls or moves. In one such embodiment the different numbers of rolls or moves are determined randomly predetermined or otherwise suitably determined. For example when a designated trigger symbol is generated on one of the reels the gaming device associates a number of rolls or moves to that trigger symbol. The gaming device randomly selects one number of rolls or moves from a plurality of such numbers. These numbers of rolls or moves may be weighted such that low numbers of rolls or moves occur more frequently than high numbers of rolls or moves. In one embodiment a plurality of designated trigger symbols are each associated with a number of rolls or moves and the designated trigger symbol that occurs on the reels in one play of the game determines the number of rolls or moves for the wild symbol or wild symbol set during that play of the game.

In one embodiment once the expanded wild reel lands or appears on one of the reels the designated trigger symbol acts as an individual wild symbol for one or more award evaluations. This additional wild symbol generates more winning combinations for players of the gaming device and gives such players a better chance of obtaining an award while playing the gaming device.

In one embodiment the gaming device disclosed herein includes a plurality of wild symbols arranged such that they can occur on the reels during the same reel spin. If a plurality of such wild symbols occur and one of the designated trigger symbols occurs in one such embodiment each wild symbol is configured to expand and roam independently. For example if the trigger symbol is associated with three rolls and two wild symbols appear on the reels a first wild symbol expands along a first reel and a second wild symbol expands along a second reel. After the first and second wild symbols expand the first and second wild symbols each will independently roll three times across the reels. In this example the gaming machine provides six total rolls i.e. three rolls each for two wild symbols . After each roll the gaming device performs an award evaluation to determine whether any winning combinations appeared on the reels. Enabling a plurality of wild symbols to appear on the reels during the same reel spin generates more winning combinations for players of the gaming device and gives such players a better chance of obtaining an award while playing the gaming device.

In another embodiment the gaming device disclosed herein includes a plurality of wild symbols arranged such that they can occur on the reels during the same reel spin. If a plurality of such wild symbols occur and one of the designated trigger symbols occurs in one such embodiment each wild symbol is configured to expand and roam at the same time. For example if the trigger symbol is associated with three rolls and two wild symbols appear on the reels a first wild symbol expands along a first reel and at substantially the same time a second wild symbol expands along a second reel. After the first and second wild symbols expand the first and second wild symbols will roll three times together across the reels and appear on two different reels. In this example the gaming machine provides three total rolls i.e. three rolls with two wild symbols moving at substantially the same time . After each roll the gaming device performs an award evaluation to determine whether any winning combinations appeared on the reels. Enabling a plurality of wild symbols to appear on the reels during the same reel spin generates more winning combinations for players of the gaming device and gives such players a better chance of obtaining an award while playing the gaming device.

Accordingly one advantage of the gaming device disclosed herein is to provide an expanding and roaming wild symbol in conjunction with a designated trigger symbol. The designated trigger symbol initiates i.e. expands the expanded wild symbol and determines a number of rolls or movements across the reels for each expanding wild symbol or wild symbol set. This enables the expanded wild symbol to roam from reel to reel which provides players with more opportunities to obtain winning combinations on the reels.

Another advantage of the gaming device disclosed herein is to expand the expanding wild symbol across multiple positions on the same reel and move the expanded wild symbol from reel to reel. That is when the wild symbol is expanded the wild symbol forms a wild reel or a wild column including a plurality of wild symbols. The wild reel or wild column is moved across the reels which moves the plurality of wild symbols in unison or independently to a new reel and generates additional award opportunities for a player of the gaming device.

In a cascading or falling symbol game symbols fall into place in respective symbol positions displayed on the display device of the gaming device. The symbols move or fall from a top of the display device instead of landing in the respective symbol positions as a plurality of reels stop sequentially e.g. left to right .

In one embodiment as illustrated in a base or primary game may be a slot game with one or more paylines . The paylines may be horizontal vertical circular diagonal angled or any combination thereof. In this embodiment the gaming device includes at least one and preferably a plurality of reels such as three to five reels in either electromechanical form with mechanical rotating reels or video form with simulated reels and movement thereof. In one embodiment an electromechanical slot machine includes a plurality of adjacent rotatable reels which may be combined and operably coupled with an electronic display of any suitable type. In another embodiment if the reels are in video form one or more of the display devices as described above display the plurality of simulated video reels . Each reel displays a plurality of indicia or symbols such as bells hearts fruits numbers letters bars or other images which preferably correspond to a theme associated with the gaming device. In another embodiment one or more of the reels are independent reels or unisymbol reels. In this embodiment each independent or unisymbol reel generates and displays one symbol to the player. In one embodiment the gaming device awards prizes after the reels of the primary game stop spinning if specified types and or configurations of indicia or symbols occur on an active payline or otherwise occur in a winning pattern occur on the requisite number of adjacent reels and or occur in a scatter pay arrangement.

In an alternative embodiment rather than determining any outcome to provide to the player by analyzing the symbols generated on any wagered upon paylines as described above the gaming device determines any outcome to provide to the player based on the number of associated symbols which are generated in active symbol positions on the requisite number of adjacent reels i.e. not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations . In this embodiment if a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels the gaming device provides the player one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination. For example if one winning symbol combination is generated on the reels the gaming device will provide a single award to the player for that winning symbol combination i.e. not based on the number of paylines that would have passed through that winning symbol combination . It should be appreciated that because a gaming device with wagering on ways to win provides the player one award for a single occurrence of a winning symbol combination and a gaming device with paylines may provide the player more than one award for the same occurrence of a single winning symbol combination i.e. if a plurality of paylines each pass through the same winning symbol combination it is possible to provide a player at a ways to win gaming device with more ways to win for an equivalent bet or wager on a traditional slot gaming device with paylines.

In one embodiment the total number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions on a first reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions on a second reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions on a third reel and so on for each reel of the gaming device with at least one symbol generated in an active symbol position. For example a three reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol positions on each reel includes 27 ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel . A four reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol positions on each reel includes 81 ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel 3 symbols on the fourth reel . A five reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol positions on each reel includes 243 ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel 3 symbols on the fourth reel 3 symbols on the fifth reel . It should be appreciated that modifying the number of generated symbols by either modifying the number of reels or modifying the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions by one or more of the reels modifies the number of ways to win.

In another embodiment the gaming device enables a player to wager on and thus activate symbol positions. In one such embodiment the symbol positions are on the reels. In this embodiment if based on the player s wager a reel is activated then each of the symbol positions of that reel will be activated and each of the active symbol positions will be part of one or more of the ways to win. In one embodiment if based on the player s wager a reel is not activated then a designated number of default symbol positions such as a single symbol position of the middle row of the reel will be activated and the default symbol position s will be part of one or more of the ways to win. This type of gaming machine enables a player to wager on one more or each of the reels and the processor of the gaming device uses the number of wagered on reels to determine the active symbol positions and the number of possible ways to win. In alternative embodiments 1 no symbols are displayed as generated at any of the inactive symbol positions or 2 any symbols generated at any inactive symbol positions may be displayed to the player but suitably shaded or otherwise designated as inactive.

In one embodiment wherein a player wagers on one or more reels a player s wager of one credit may activate each of the three symbol positions on a first reel wherein one default symbol position is activated on each of the remaining four reels. In this example as described above the gaming device provides the player three ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 1 symbol on the second reel 1 symbol on the third reel 1 symbol on the fourth reel 1 symbol on the fifth reel . In another example a player s wager of nine credits may activate each of the three symbol positions on a first reel each of the three symbol positions on a second reel and each of the three symbol positions on a third reel wherein one default symbol position is activated on each of the remaining two reels. In this example as described above the gaming device provides the player twenty seven ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel 1 symbol on the fourth reel 1 symbol on the fifth reel .

In one embodiment to determine any award s to provide to the player based on the generated symbols the gaming device individually determines if a symbol generated in an active symbol position on a first reel forms part of a winning symbol combination with or is otherwise suitably related to a symbol generated in an active symbol position on a second reel. In this embodiment the gaming device classifies each pair of symbols which form part of a winning symbol combination i.e. each pair of related symbols as a string of related symbols. For example if active symbol positions include a first cherry symbol generated in the top row of a first reel and a second cherry symbol generated in the bottom row of a second reel the gaming device classifies the two cherry symbols as a string of related symbols because the two cherry symbols form part of a winning symbol combination.

After determining if any strings of related symbols are formed between the symbols on the first reel and the symbols on the second reel the gaming device determines if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel should be added to any of the formed strings of related symbols. In this embodiment for a first of the classified strings of related symbols the gaming device determines if any of the symbols generated by the next adjacent reel form part of a winning symbol combination or are otherwise related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols. If the gaming device determines that a symbol generated on the next adjacent reel is related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols that symbol is subsequently added to the first string of related symbols. For example if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and a related cherry symbol is generated in the middle row of the third reel the gaming device adds the related cherry symbol generated on the third reel to the previously classified string of cherry symbols.

On the other hand if the gaming device determines that no symbols generated on the next adjacent reel are related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols the gaming device marks or flags such string of related symbols as complete. For example if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and none of the symbols of the third reel are related to the cherry symbols of the previously classified string of cherry symbols the gaming device marks or flags the string of cherry symbols as complete.

After either adding a related symbol to the first string of related symbols or marking the first string of related symbols as complete the gaming device proceeds as described above for each of the remaining classified strings of related symbols which were previously classified or formed from related symbols on the first and second reels.

After analyzing each of the remaining strings of related symbols the gaming device determines for each remaining pending or incomplete string of related symbols if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel if any should be added to any of the previously classified strings of related symbols. This process continues until either each string of related symbols is complete or there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze. In this embodiment where there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze the gaming device marks each of the remaining pending strings of related symbols as complete.

When each of the strings of related symbols is marked complete the gaming device compares each of the strings of related symbols to an appropriate paytable and provides the player any award associated with each of the completed strings of symbols. It should be appreciated that the player is provided one award if any for each string of related symbols generated in active symbol positions i.e. as opposed to being based on how many paylines that would have passed through each of the strings of related symbols in active symbol positions .

In one embodiment a base or primary game may be a poker game wherein the gaming device enables the player to play a conventional game of video draw poker and initially deals five cards all face up from a virtual deck of fifty two card deck. Cards may be dealt as in a traditional game of cards or in the case of the gaming device may also include that the cards are randomly selected from a predetermined number of cards. If the player wishes to draw the player selects the cards to hold via one or more input device such as pressing related hold buttons or via the touch screen. The player then presses the deal button and the unwanted or discarded cards are removed from the display and the gaming machine deals the replacement cards from the remaining cards in the deck. This results in a final five card hand. The gaming device compares the final five card hand to a payout table which utilizes conventional poker hand rankings to determine the winning hands. The gaming device provides the player with an award based on a winning hand and the credits the player wagered.

In another embodiment the base or primary game may be a multi hand version of video poker. In this embodiment the gaming device deals the player at least two hands of cards. In one such embodiment the cards are the same cards. In one embodiment each hand of cards is associated with its own deck of cards. The player chooses the cards to hold in a primary hand. The held cards in the primary hand are also held in the other hands of cards. The remaining non held cards are removed from each hand displayed and for each hand replacement cards are randomly dealt into that hand. Since the replacement cards are randomly dealt independently for each hand the replacement cards for each hand will usually be different. The poker hand rankings are then determined hand by hand and awards are provided to the player.

In one embodiment a base or primary game may be a keno game wherein the gaming device displays a plurality of selectable indicia or numbers on at least one of the display devices. In this embodiment the player selects at least one or a plurality of the selectable indicia or numbers via an input device such as the touch screen. The gaming device then displays a series of drawn numbers to determine an amount of matches if any between the player s selected numbers and the gaming device s drawn numbers. The player is provided an award based on the amount of matches if any based on the amount of determined matches and the number of numbers drawn.

In one embodiment in addition to winning credits or other awards in a base or primary game the gaming device may also give players the opportunity to win credits in a bonus or secondary game or bonus or secondary round. The bonus or secondary game enables the player to obtain a prize or payout in addition to the prize or payout if any obtained from the base or primary game.

One or more awards are associated with the winning symbol combinations and one of such awards is provided to the player when the associated winning symbol combination is displayed on the reels and . For example a combination of four orange symbols may be associated with an award of 50 credits and a combination of five 10 symbols may be associated with 200 credits.

As illustrated in orange symbols were generated on the first third and fourth reels and and are displayed in association with the respective reel or symbol positions and of those reels and . The wild symbol and the orange symbols are each displayed along the same payline. In this example the wild symbol functions as or changes to an orange symbol. The wild symbol cooperates with the orange symbols of the first third and fourth reels and to complete a winning symbol combination such as four oranges associated with 50 credits. An award display may inform the player of the number of credits won via messaging such as YOU HAVE WON 50 CREDITS or FOUR ORANGES PAY 50 CREDITS Accordingly the award is provided to the player and added to the total award display . As illustrated in the total award display indicates that the player won 50 credits.

As illustrated in the player has one roll or move remaining as indicated by the rolls remaining display . In one embodiment the player uses the remaining rolls or moves to roll or move the expanded wild reel one more time in the bonus feature. In another embodiment the game ends when the player obtains an award in the game. In another embodiment the game ends when the player has no remaining rolls. In another embodiment the game ends when the player has no remaining rolls but instead of providing the player a predetermined number of moves the player is enabled to roll the expanded wild until the player loses.

In one embodiment the gaming device includes overlapping expanded and roaming wild symbols. For example a first expanded wild symbol may be associated with two rolls and a second expanded wild symbol may be associated with three rolls. In one embodiment the first and second expanded wild symbols roll together i.e. at substantially the same time to one of the reels. In another embodiment the first and second expanded wild symbols roll independently. Alternatively in an embodiment where the reels spin after each movement of the expanded wild reel a first expanded wild symbol is associated with two moves. In a first move the first expanded wild symbol moves to one of the reels. After this movement the reels spin and generate symbols in respective reel or symbol positions. If one of the symbols includes a second wild symbol the second wild symbol expands and is associated with a number of moves such as two moves. In a second move of the first expanded wild symbol and a first move of the second expanded wild symbol the first and second expanded wild symbols move to one of the reels. After this movement the first expanded wild symbol has no remaining rolls and may be 1 changed to the symbols underlying the expanded wild symbols or 2 kept as wild symbols. The second expanded wild symbol then moves to another reel. In this embodiment the bonus game ends when each expanded wild symbol has no remaining rolls or moves.

In one embodiment of the gaming device disclosed herein the gaming device enhances a player s opportunity to obtain one or more awards in a game by utilizing the expanded and roaming wild reel to provide a better opportunity of obtaining an award in the game. In this embodiment the processor of the gaming device holds the reels other than the expanded wild reel stationary for each roll or move of the expanded wild reel . The expanded and roaming wild reel moves relative to the stationary reels.

In another embodiment the processor of the gaming device holds the expanded wild reel stationary and moves the reels relative to the expanded wild reel for each roll or move associated with the trigger symbol . For example each roll or move associated with each trigger symbol that appears on the reels causes one or more symbols to move relative to the expanded wild reel. In one move or roll the symbols on the reels may shift one reel or symbol position in any direction e.g. left right or any other suitable direction relative to the expanded wild reel.

In another embodiment of the gaming device disclosed herein the processor of the gaming device spins the reels including the expanded wild reel for each roll or move of the expanded wild reel . For example after the expanded wild reel rolls to one of the reels the reels other than the expanded wild reel are spun to display different symbols and on the reels. The award or awards if any associated with any winning symbol combinations occurring on one of the paylines is provided to the player.

In one embodiment the gaming device disclosed herein includes a plurality of wild symbols arranged such that they can occur on the reels during the same reel spin. If a plurality of such wild symbols occur in one such embodiment each wild symbol is configured to expand and roam independently. For example if the trigger symbol is associated with three rolls and two wild symbols appear on the reels a first wild symbol expands along a first reel and a second wild symbol expands along a second reel. After the first and second wild symbols expand the first and second wild symbols each will independently roll three times across the reels. In this example the gaming machine provides six total rolls i.e. three rolls each for two wild symbols . After each roll the gaming device performs an award evaluation to determine whether any winning combinations appeared on the reels. Accordingly enabling a plurality of wild symbols to appear on the reels during the same reel spin generates more winning combinations for players of the gaming device and gives such players a better chance of obtaining an award while playing the gaming device.

In another embodiment the gaming device disclosed herein includes a plurality of wild symbols arranged such that they can occur on the reels during the same reel spin. If a plurality of such wild symbols occur and one of the designated trigger symbols occurs in one such embodiment each wild symbol is configured to expand and roam at substantially the same time. For example if the trigger symbol is associated with three rolls and two wild symbols appear on the reels a first wild symbol expands along a first reel and at substantially the same time a second wild symbol expands along a second reel. After the first and second wild symbols expand the first and second wild symbols will roll three times together across the reels and appear on two different reels. In this example the gaming machine provides three total rolls i.e. three rolls with two wild symbols moving at substantially the same time .

In one embodiment of the gaming device disclosed herein the symbols on the reels include at least one bonus symbol. When the bonus symbol is indicated on one or more designated paylines in a game the gaming device provides an additional award or bonus award in the game. The bonus award associated with the bonus symbol may be at least one additional roll or at least one free roll of the expanded wild reel. It should be appreciated that the bonus award may be any suitable award as desired by the game implementer. The bonus award enables a player to obtain additional awards or additional rolls of the expanded wild reel in a game which further increases the player s opportunities to win an award in the game and enhances the player s excitement and enjoyment of the game.

In another embodiment a probability of being indicated on one or more paylines associated with the reels is associated with each of the symbols on the reels. In one embodiment the probability associated with the wild symbol and or the trigger symbol is less than at least one of the probabilities associated with the other symbols on the reels. In another embodiment the probability associated with the wild symbol and or the trigger symbol is less than a plurality of the probabilities associated with the other symbols on the reels. In a further embodiment the probability associated with the wild symbol and or the trigger symbol is less than all of the probabilities associated with the other symbols on the reels. It should be appreciated that the probabilities associated with the symbols may be any suitable probabilities as desired by the game implementer.

In one alternative embodiment the gaming device disclosed herein includes a plurality of reels and a duplicating and roaming wild symbol that independently moves relative to the reels to provide a player with additional opportunities to win an award. Each reel includes a plurality of reel or symbol positions that represent a position or area in which a designated symbol appears on the reel. When a wild symbol appears on one of the reels the wild symbol duplicates to other reel or symbol positions when a designated trigger symbol also appears on one of the reels. That is the wild symbol duplicates to at least one other reel or symbol position of the same reel or of a different reel. Each duplicated wild symbol overlays or replaces one symbol on the reels and causes each replaced symbol to act as a wild symbol. The designated trigger symbol is associated with a number of duplications i.e. the number of times the wild symbol will duplicate and a number of rolls i.e. the number of times the wild symbol will roll across the reels . In one embodiment the number of duplications and or the number of rolls is determined based on a predetermined number a randomly determined number or a number based on another functional game element such as the player s wager the player s status as determined through a player tracking system or the amount of time the player has played the game.

In one embodiment separate and different trigger symbols are associated with a different numbers of duplications and or different numbers of rolls. For example upon the occurrence of a first trigger symbol the wild symbol may duplicate a first designated number of times e.g. three times and upon the occurrence of a second trigger symbol the wild symbol may duplicate a second designated number of times e.g. two times . In this example it should be appreciated that each wild symbol may duplicate to other reel or symbol positions roll to one of the reels or duplicate and roll.

In this embodiment each duplicated wild symbol rolls left to right or right to left to one of the reels for each roll associated with the trigger symbol. The reel to which the duplicated wild symbol moves is randomly determined in one embodiment. That is each duplicated wild symbol randomly moves or roams from reel to reel for a number of rolls or moves. In one embodiment each duplicated wild symbol randomly and independently moves or roams from reel to reel. That is a first duplicated wild symbol rolls to a first reel and a second duplicated wild symbol rolls to a second reel which may be the same or different reel as the first reel . In one embodiment when the duplicated wild symbols land on respective reels the designated trigger symbol acts as an individual wild symbol for an award evaluation. During the award evaluation the gaming device determines whether one or more winning combinations are displayed on the reels. The duplicating and roaming wild symbol and the individual wild symbol generate more winning combinations for players of the gaming device and give such players a better chance of obtaining an award while playing the gaming device.

In another embodiment the gaming device disclosed herein includes an expanding and roaming wild symbol that expands across a plurality of reels. That is the wild symbol expands e.g. left to right or right to left and causes at least one symbol of a plurality of reels to act as a wild symbol e.g. in the form of an expanding wild row . In one such embodiment the expanding wild row rolls top to bottom or bottom to top instead of left to right or right to left . As in other embodiments disclosed herein one or more trigger symbols determines the number of rolls associated with each expanding wild symbol that appears on the reels.

In one alternative embodiment as illustrated in B C and D the expanding and roaming wild symbol is employed in a card game such as a video poker game. In this embodiment the display device of the gaming device displays a plurality of poker hands and . Each poker hand includes a plurality of cards to a player. The cards include a plurality of symbols including at least one wild symbol e.g. at least one wild card . The symbols may be any suitable symbols such as numbers colors letters playing card suits images or any other suitable symbols or images. In this alternative embodiment one of the cards is designated as a trigger symbol such as the trigger symbol described above. When one of the poker hands includes the designated card e.g. the trigger symbol and a wild card a bonus feature is initiated to provide the player with increased opportunities to win an award in the game.

Referring to the above embodiment is illustrated where a display device of the gaming device such as the display device displays three poker hands of five cards each to the player in the game. Each poker hand is dealt from one or more decks of at least 52 playing cards. The first poker hand includes an ace of diamonds a trigger symbol such as a three of hearts an ace of spades an ace of clubs and a five of diamonds . The three of hearts is designated as the trigger symbol and is highlighted to indicate the trigger symbol to the player. It should be appreciated that the trigger symbol may be indicated by any suitable indicator or symbol. The second poker hand includes a king of diamonds a queen of clubs a six of diamonds an eight of diamonds and a wild card . The third poker hand includes a jack of diamonds a jack of spades a seven of clubs a nine of spades and a ten of hearts . In this embodiment the minimum hand value for a winning combination of cards is a pair of matching cards such as a pair of jacks or better. Therefore the combination of cards displayed in hands and produce a winning combination of cards in the game. In one embodiment the awards associated with these winning combination of cards are added to a total award display and provided to the player when the game ends. The total award display indicates the total value of the awards accumulated by the player in the game. In one embodiment an award display may inform the player of the number of credits won via messaging such as YOU HAVE WON 50 CREDITS or FOUR ACES PAY 500 CREDITS 

As illustrated the display device may include a credit display which displays the number of credits available to the player to wager or bet on the game. A bet or wager display indicates the number of credits the player wagered or bet on the game. A paytable display indicates upon player request or input information associated with a paytable of the game. Such information may include one or more awards associated with winning symbols or symbol combinations in the game. A volume display indicates the volume at which sounds of the game are presented to the player. Through player input the volume display enables the player to adjust the volume at which sounds of the game are presented to the player.

As illustrated the three of hearts card is the trigger symbol. In other embodiments any of the cards could be designated as the trigger symbol or a card with the words Trigger Card could be designated as the trigger symbol. Because the trigger symbol appears as one of the cards card in hand and a wild symbol appears as one of the cards card in hand a bonus feature is initiated.

As illustrated in in the bonus feature the gaming device processor expands each wild symbol or wild card indicated in the poker hands and . The wild card is expanded to hands and and overlays the five of diamonds of hand and the ten of hearts of hand . During an initial award evaluation not shown the cards and in the hands and act as wild cards. Accordingly as illustrated in hand includes a winning combination of four aces hand includes a winning combination of two kings and hand includes a winning combination of three jacks. As illustrated the trigger symbol e.g. the three of hearts is associated with two rolls and changes to a wild symbol during the initial award evaluation. In one embodiment the trigger symbol changes to a wild symbol after the initial award evaluation so that the trigger symbol acts as a wild symbol in each award evaluation after the initial award evaluation.

The gaming device rolls or moves these expanded wild symbols until the number of moves associated with the trigger symbol are used. After each roll the gaming device changes the trigger symbol to a wild symbol and performs an award evaluation using the expanded wild symbols and the wild trigger symbol. As illustrated in the trigger symbol is changed to a wild symbol or card. As illustrated the expanded wild symbols rolled to at least one other card of the poker hands. The expanded wild symbols landed on or moved to cards and of hands and respectively. The expanded wild symbols overlay the ace of spades of hand the six of diamonds of hand and the seven of clubs of hand . During an award evaluation not shown the cards and in the hands and act as wild cards. Additionally the trigger symbol i.e. the three of hearts which is card of hand is now a wild card. Accordingly as illustrated in hand includes a winning combination of four aces hand includes a winning combination of three kings and hand includes a winning combination of three jacks.

After each award evaluation the gaming device provides the player with the award associated with the winning combination of cards in the game. Although not illustrated the award can be indicated by the total award display .
