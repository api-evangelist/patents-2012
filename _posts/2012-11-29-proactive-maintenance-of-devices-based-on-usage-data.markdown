The specification relates to a system and method for monitoring device usage. In particular the specification relates to monitoring device usage based on transactions between devices.

Companies increasingly rely upon many types of devices for group and individual use. The devices each have a certain life after which they need to be serviced or replaced. Typically that is done when the device malfunctions resulting in a disruption of the continuity of everyday business.

Some prior art systems for example multifunction printers record device usage through additional hardware and software embedded inside the devices. The usage data is collected either manually or by using an extra piece of hardware for example a server that collects and centralizes data and analytics from each device before generating a report that summarizes the usage pattern of a fleet of devices. This is problematic because each device has to come equipped with the hardware or if possible software has to be installed.

The invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art with a system for monitoring device usage. In one embodiment the system includes one or more processors an enterprise service bus executable by the one or more processors the enterprise service bus configured to receive a request from a first device for a second device to perform an action and network appliance as a service NAaaS server side application services executable by the one or more processors the NAaaS server side application services configured to receive instructions from the enterprise service bus to log a device usage entry for the request determine usage information based on the device usage entry compare the usage information to a life expectancy associated with the second device and generate a notification based on the comparison. In some embodiments the NAaaS server side application services are further configured to perform a comparison between device usage entries for the second device and a similar device to determine whether the second device is close to a breakdown point experienced by the similar device.

Other aspects include corresponding methods systems apparatuses and computer program products for these and other innovative aspects.

In another embodiment the user management service is stored in the memory and is accessible and executable by the processor . In either embodiment the user management service is adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and the communication unit via signal line .

The user management service receives user information and generates a user profile. For example the user management service a name a job title a job code an e mail address a phone number a username a password a retina scan of the user a fingerprint swipe of the user etc. The user management service generates login credentials for the user based on the registration information and stores the login credentials in the data storage for the user. The user management service associated a unique identifier with the user. This can be the user s full name an email address for the user a series of numbers an employee identifier etc. The unique identifier is used to track the user s activities in the system.

In one embodiment the login credentials are generated as a single sign on with a property that provides access control to multiple and independent devices and services using the same login credentials. For example a user logs in with the user credentials and gains access to all registered services without being prompted to login at each one of them. In another example a user logs into different types of devices such as a projector an interactive whiteboard etc. using the same user credentials. In one embodiment the user management service stores the login credentials of users as an organized set of records with a hierarchical structure in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP server not shown associated with a business. The user management service also manages preferences for the user that are received during registration or at other times. For example the user can upload an image to associate with the login credentials.

In some embodiments where the user devices and or computing devices use different login information than the login information used to authenticate the user with the system the user management service receives the login information from the user or an administrator and adds the information to the user s profile. For example a user s laptop includes a four digit code that needs to be input before the user can access the contents of the laptop. The user management service adds the information to the user s profile.

The user management service performs authentication. For example a user enters login credentials into a user interface on the user device . The user device transmits the login credentials to the enterprise service bus which requests that the user management service authenticate the user based on the login credentials. The user management service identifies the user associated with the user device compares the login credentials to the user profile and either sends a confirmation back to the enterprise service bus that the login credentials were correct or a notification that there was a login error. The confirmation includes the user identification associated with the user.

In one embodiment if the login request for authentication does not include a correct user name and password the login request is denied. In another embodiment the user management service is used in account recovery when the user has forgotten his or her username and or password. In some instances the user management service detects a potentially fraudulent authentication by analyzing the secondary information included in the login request. For example if the username associated with the login request is a username of a user no longer employed at a company or a suspected bot the user management service identifies the login request as potentially fraudulent. The user management service detects a potentially fraudulent authentication by comparing the secondary information to historical authentication information of the user. For example if the login request for authentication originates from a country or device that the user has not attempted to send login requests from before e.g. unregistered device the user management service identifies the login request as potentially fraudulent. In one embodiment a potentially fraudulent authentication attempt includes a failed authentication attempt.

The device inventory service is code and routines for registering devices in the network .

The device inventory service receives a request to register one or more types of user devices and one or more types of computing devices . In one embodiment the device inventory service registers the type of device and an IP address or MAC address for the device with the network and creates a device identifier specific for the device. For example a new projector with model number 1042 is registered and assigned a device identifier such as prj1042ul. In one embodiment the device inventory service receives a request to register one or more types of user devices under a particular username stored in the data storage . For example a user can register personal devices such as a tablet PC a smartphone etc. and associate the devices with a form of identification such as an employee identifier user identifier etc. In another embodiment the device inventory service receives a request to register the one or more types of computing devices for use at a particular location or within certain limits of space. For example a projector can be registered for use on the first floor of a building and an interactive whiteboard can be registered for use in a conference room. The first floor of the building and the conference room each has a location identifier associated with them. The device inventory service stores the device registration information e.g. IP addresses device identifiers etc. in the data storage .

In another embodiment the device inventory service identifies devices associated with a location using a location identifier generated by the location service . The location identifier is received from the device management engine for storing in the data storage . For example a projector can be registered to a conference room in a building in Tokyo Japan and the conference room has a location identifier.
