title: Method and system for restricting access to user resources
abstract: A user's set top box (STB), or other client, executes a shell and has an application program interface (API) by which certain features of the client can be controlled. The client is in communication with a walled garden proxy server (WGPS). The client sends a request to the WGPS to access a service provided by a site in the garden. The site sends the client a message containing code calling a function in the API. The WGPS traps the message from the site and looks up the site in a table to determine the access control list (ACL) for the site. The WGPS includes the ACL in the header of the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) message to the client. The shell receives the message and extracts the ACL. If the code lacks permission, the shell stops execution.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 901 081 filed on Oct. 8 2010 which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 7 873 737 filed on Jul. 1 2008 which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 7 406 530 filed on Apr. 30 2004 which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 6 732 179 filed on Oct. 26 1999 which is a continuation in part of U.S. Pat. No. 6 370 571 filed on Mar. 5 1997 and is related to U.S. Pat. No. 6 678 733 filed on Oct. 26 1999 the entire contents of each being hereby incorporated by reference herein.

This invention pertains in general to high speed data networks and in particular to a system and method for restricting access by servers on the network to resources available on user computer systems.

Cable television service is usually sold as a subscription to one or more tiers of channels. Typically a basic cable subscription allows access to a small tier of channels and is sold for a relatively low subscription fee. The subscriber can purchase additional tiers of cable channels for additional fees.

In most cable systems the subscriber uses a set top box STB to access the cable channels. The STB contains a microprocessor and other hardware for tuning and descrambling channels in the tiers to which the subscriber has access. The STB may also enable other services such as pay per view or digital music reception in return for additional fees.

In recent years the STB has incorporated a cable modem that enables access to Internet and World Wide Web the web based resources via the cable infrastructure. A cable modem typically has at least one assigned Internet Protocol IP address and is managed by an Internet Service Provider ISP . The ISP inserts and extracts Internet traffic to and from the cable infrastructure and distributes it to the cable modem having the given IP address or the Internet as appropriate.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 678 733 discloses a walled garden accessible to STB users who are customers of the ISP. Application servers within the walled garden provide services to the users including for example access to electronic content access to electronic commerce services and any other functionality that can be provided electronically via a network. The users can subscribe to one or more of the services in the walled garden either individually or as part of a tier. U.S. Pat. No. 6 678 733 discloses a way to restrict users to only those services in the walled garden to which the users are entitled to access.

The walled garden application servers may desire or need to access features of the users STBs in order to provide certain services. For example an application server may need to generate text or controls on a user s television display change the channel to which the STB is tuned print a receipt on a printer coupled to the STB or complete a fee transaction using an electronic wallet stored in the STB.

The ISP would prefer to limit the features on the users STBs to which the application servers have access typically to generate revenue and enhance security. For example the ISP may desire to charge a fee for letting an application server change the channel to which the user s STB is tuned or conduct an electronic commerce transaction using the electronic wallet. Likewise the ISP would like to limit the abilities of the application server to ensure that a misbehaving or compromised application server cannot act maliciously toward a user s STB.

Accordingly there is a need for a way to restrict the features of a user s STB that can be accessed and utilized by an application server within the walled garden. Preferably the solution to this need will restrict the features at a fine grain thereby allowing an application server to access only those features which are necessary to provide the service sought by the user.

The above needs are met by a method and system that passes an access control list ACL to the set top box STB or other form of client indicating which functions in the client can be called by a walled garden site. A client is coupled to a television set computer system or other device having a display. The client preferably contains a central processing unit a memory a television tuner and a cable modem. The client also preferably contains a video subsystem for generating images on the display and an input for accepting commands from the user.

The client preferably executes software supporting standard web browsing functionality. In one embodiment the client executes the Windows CE operating system. Programs executing on the operating system include a hypertext markup language HTML rendering engine a JAVA virtual machine for executing JAVA programs and other controls supporting web browsing functionality. A shell program also preferably executes on the operating system and generates a user interface on the display. The shell program controls access to sets of application program interfaces APIs for providing functionality at the client. For example the APIs include functions allowing a program to change the channel access an electronic program guide held by the client instantiate user interface UI elements and access an electronic walled held by the client.

The cable modem is preferably coupled to a coaxial cable and supports bi directional broadband communications using the Internet protocol IP . The coaxial cable is typically aggregated with other cables into a fiber optic cable. The fiber optic cable in turn is coupled to a cable modem termination server CMTS at a headend. The CMTS contains hardware for terminating the IP data channel including IP switches routers and high availability servers.

The CMTS allows the client to access a private network containing a walled garden proxy server WGPS via the hypertext transport protocol HTTP . The WGPS controls access to a walled garden of network based services. The services available in the walled garden may include for example access to electronic content access to electronic commerce services and any other functionality that can be provided electronically via a network. These services are provided by one or more walled garden servers coupled to a walled garden network. The walled garden servers may include servers directly coupled to the walled garden network servers having direct connections to remote application databases servers coupled to the walled garden network via a virtual private network and servers having only a frontend on the walled garden network. Each site on a walled garden server is identified by a plot number.

A site held on a server within the walled garden may respond to a user by sending a message containing a JAVASCRIPT program to the client. The program can invoke one or more of the functions in the APIs. The WGPS traps messages from the site and determines the ACL for the site. The ACL is preferably a bit map that specifies which STB API functions may be called by the site. The WGPS passes the ACL to the client as a header to the message from the site. In addition the WGPS examines the header received from the site to protect against ACL masquerading or spoofing by the site.

The shell executing on the client extracts the ACL from the header when it receives the message. The shell uses the bit map to determine which API functions can be invoked by the walled garden site. If the JAVASCRIPT program tries to invoke a function for which it lacks permission the client halts execution of the program and sends a message back to the site indicating that the invocation failed because the site lacks permission. Otherwise the client allows the JAVASCRIPT program to invoke the function and returns the result to the site. Thus the walled garden site can use the APIs to provide services to the user.

Typically the client is an STB and is purchased or leased by a person or household who also subscribes to the cable TV and data communication services. The person or persons who performs this task is often referred to as the subscriber. Because multiple people may use a single client the person using the client in this description is referred to as a user. The STB or other device that the user uses to access data communication services is generically referred to as a client. The distinction between actions performed by the user and client are often blurred especially when the client performs an action such as fetching a web page on behalf of a user. Accordingly the terms user and client are often interchangeable in this description.

The client preferably includes at least one tuner for tuning a TV signal and a cable modem for receiving and transmitting data. In addition the client is preferably coupled to a coaxial cable carrying analog and or digital TV signals and providing two way data communication between the client and the rest of the network using the Internet protocol IP . In alternative embodiments data communication between the client and the rest of the network may be provided by other forms of communication technologies including analog modem digital subscriber line DSL and wireless technologies. These alternative technologies may or may not carry TV or other video signals with the data.

In the embodiment where the client is coupled to a coaxial cable the coaxial cable is aggregated with other cables at a node typically from geographically proximate locations into a fiber optic cable . The fiber optic cable in turn is aggregated with other fiber optic cables at a headend .

The headend integrates signals from multiple sources into the fiber optic cable . In one embodiment the headend receives analog A and digital B television signals via analog A and digital B satellite downlinks respectively. In addition the headend includes a cable modem termination server CMTS for terminating the IP data channel including IP switches routers and high availability servers.

The CMTS is preferably coupled to a private network maintained by an Internet service provider ISP or other organization. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the private network includes the high speed network architecture described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08 811 586 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DELIVERING HIGH PERFORMANCE ONLINE MULTIMEDIA SERVICES filed on Mar. 5 1997 by Milo S. Medin which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. In general the private network provides network access to the users by managing a cable modem contained within the client . A widely accepted standard for cable modems is the Multimedia Cable Network System MCNS Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications DOCSIS . The private network also provides connectivity to servers providing services to the clients such as caching account and billing management electronic commerce information databases and any other functionality that can be achieved via a network. Typically the resources on the private network can be accessed by only subscribers of the ISP.

In the illustrated embodiment the private network is in communication with the Internet via a network link . For security purposes a preferred embodiment of the present invention restricts the ability of the client to download software from the Internet . However other embodiments may provide the client with full access to the Internet or restrict the client to only the resources available in the private network .

The bus also couples the CPU with a graphics and video subsystem which generates text and video images on the TV . In addition to providing conventional TV images the graphics and video subsystem preferably generates a user interface UI by which the user can access the features and services provided by the client . The graphics and video subsystem may also support advanced features such as 3 D graphics video decoding and video digitizing.

TV and cable modem tuners are also preferably coupled to the bus . The TV tuner is preferably a frequency agile tuner dedicated to analog and digital broadcast services. The cable modem tuner is preferably a frequency agile tuner dedicated to cable modem services. Although not shown in the client may also include other tuners for handling an out of band data channel and a return signal path. The tuners receive the signal from the coaxial cable .

An infrared IR transceiver is also preferably coupled to the bus . The transceiver can communicate with a wireless remote control or keyboard thereby allowing a user to access the features of the client either directly or via on screen menus. The client also preferably includes a secure microprocessor for supporting secure transactions as described below. The secure microprocessor holds a unique identification value for the client called the Box ID a private public key pair and other information that can be used to authorize and authenticate messages to and from the client . In alternative embodiments the client may also include an audio accelerator for performing audio processing an input output I O controller for communicating with external devices such as storage devices and hard copy output devices and or a network adapter for communicating with a local area network.

A JAVA virtual machine JVM and hypertext markup language HTML rendering engine preferably execute on the OS . The JVM functions as a virtual machine and provides an execution space for JAVA programs . The JAVA programs may be stored locally on the client or downloaded from the private network or the Internet . In addition the JAVA programs may utilize JAVA classes dedicated to supporting the TV and media functions available on the client . Similarly the HTML rendering engine supports traditional web browsing functionality. A user can use the web browser controls to navigate through hypertext documents as is well known in the art.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a shell program executes at the highest level. The shell program may be implemented using for example native code JAVA JAVSCRIPT ActiveX controls HTML and or dynamic link libraries DLLs . The shell program is the controlling application and provides the user interface UI on the TV and application support for channel navigation an electronic program guide storing user preferences email and walled garden access.

Preferably the shell program contains a set of foundation layer APIs that can be called by programs downloaded via the private network . In one embodiment the functions in the APIs are accessed by JAVASCRIPT code downloaded to the client via HTTP. All functions available through the APIs are subject to access control and a program making use of the APIs must be authorized to access the functions. If a program calls a function for which it is not authorized the client returns a FAIL FUNCTION NOT AUTHORIZED error status message to the program. This status message indicates to the program that the server that supplied the program is not authorized to perform that function on the client .

Exemplary sets of APIs are described in the Appendix. As described therein the APIs allow a program to change the television channel to which the client is tuned inquire about the details of a channel line up access an electronic program guide EPG stored by the client instantiate UI elements on the television retrieve information about viewer i.e. user accounts access electronic wallet E wallet functionality in the client to conduct electronic commerce transactions set reminders for display on the television and print pages on a printer not shown coupled to the client. Additional APIs may allow controlling scaling of the broadcast video picture on the television and accessing settings stored by the client including user preferences bookmarks parental controls and diagnostics. Other APIs can easily be added to the shell to provide functionality desired by the ISP server or users. Preferably each function in the APIs is named numbered or otherwise uniquely identified. Likewise groups of functions related or otherwise may also be named numbered or otherwise identified.

Preferably the client communicates with the servers on the network using standard communications protocols including the IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP and secure sockets layer SSL . Communications between the client and the various servers often takes the form of hypertext markup language HTML documents extensible markup language XML documents JAVASCRIPT programs and data provided through forms. Servers and data on the network are preferably identified with uniform resource locators URLs .

Each user of the client preferably has a unique identification. A user can log into the client by inputting the user s identity and a personal identification number PIN or other form of password. This user information is preferably stored in a local database held in for example the non volatile memory or a storage device. The database has a record for each user of the client and associates the record with the user s login information. The client can provide the user s login information to other servers in the network when necessary to authenticate the user. For security the user records stored in the client are opaque and cannot be viewed without the login information of the particular user. When a user logs into the client the login preferably remains valid until the user explicitly logs out or the client is turned off. If no user has logged into the client one embodiment of the present invention uses a default user profile. The rights and privileges of the default user profile can be set by the ISP.

The WGPS is the entry point for the walled garden . Although illustrates only a single walled garden an embodiment of the present invention can have multiple walled gardens controlled by a single WGPS or by multiple WGPS . Each walled garden may be controlled by a different multiple systems operator MSO e.g. a different cable television company .

The illustrated walled garden includes one or more servers which in turn hold one or more sites for providing network based services to the users. The services may include for example access to electronic content such as channel guides magazines newspapers stock prices music or video access to electronic commerce services such as stock trading and buying and selling goods access to a time based or metered service and any other functionality that can be provided electronically via a network. Preferably the services are implemented using a combination of JAVA XML HTML and or JAVASCRIPT. The servers may be maintained by the MSO ISP or by other organizations who have formed business relationships with the party managing the walled garden . In one embodiment the services in the walled garden are arranged into sets of tiers. Preferably the user can subscribe to one or more of the services in the walled garden either individually or as part of a tier.

The WGPS has an associated database for holding permissions available to the user and the walled garden sites. To access the walled garden the client must present a ticket to the WGPS specifying the walled garden and services to which the user has access. Alternatively the ticket may specify only those services which the user does not have access. The database identifies poisoned tickets i.e. those tickets that are no longer accepted and holds keys for decrypting encrypted tickets. The database also holds information identifying the MSO or MSOs who s customers have access to the walled garden in order to ensure that the ticket is affiliated with the particular walled garden. The WGPS uses the ticket and the information in the database to authenticate the user and authorize the user to access the services in the walled garden .

The database also identifies the rights of walled garden sites to access the APIs in the clients . Preferably the database stores a Walled Garden Permissions Table that specifies the API access rights of each server or site in the walled garden. In one embodiment of the present invention the permissions table is as follows 

The permissions table is preferably indexed by URL prefix. The URL Prefix field preferably holds a URL string long enough to uniquely identify the walled garden site having the associated permissions. For example the URLs http disney.com company index.html and http disney.com company about index.html will both match a table entry with the URL prefix http disney.com company . This technique allows different permissions to be assigned to different subtrees of a site s content.

The User Agent field preferably holds a string identifying the type of browser used by the user. For example the User Agent field may indicate that the user is using a DCT 5000 STB. Alternatively the field may indicate that the user is using NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER or any other type of browser. Since different user agents may have different API sets and capabilities sites in the walled garden may have separate permissions table entries for each type of user agent. The client identifies the user agent when it sends a HTTP request to the WGPS .

The Walled Garden Access Control List WG ACL field preferably contains a bit map or ACL indicating to which client APIs the walled garden sites having the given URL prefix can access. The mapping from bit position to API function is arbitrary and extensible. A value of zero preferably means the site does not have permission to invoke the corresponding API function or functions and a value of one preferably means the site does have permission to invoke the corresponding API function or functions. The Affiliation field identifies the particular walled garden or MSO to which the ACL pertains.

The exemplary walled garden illustrated in contains two walled garden application servers WGAS s A B a walled garden front end server WGFS and a walled garden virtual private network VPN termination point WGVPNTP interconnected by a walled garden network WGN . The WGN is preferably a closed network and essentially performs as a local area network coupling the various types of walled garden servers with the WGPS . A WGAS is preferably a web server or some other form of server that provides web like functionality to a user. A WGAS A may contain all of the hardware and storage necessary to provide a service to a user. Alternatively the WGAS B may be coupled to a remote application database via a dedicated network connection . This latter embodiment may be preferred for example when the WGAS B acts as an interface to a large database of information and the entity managing the WGAS B does not wish to replicate the contents of the database within the walled garden .

The WGFS provides a frontend interface for backend servers located elsewhere on the Internet or otherwise in communication with WGFS . For example a WGFS may be used when a large organization wishing to have a presence in the walled garden leases server space from the ISP or other entity managing the walled garden. The WGFS provides an access point in the walled garden through which the clients can access the backend servers.

The WGVPNTP allows an organization to maintain a presence in the walled garden using remote servers. The ISP or other entity managing the walled garden establishes a VPN over the Internet connecting the WGVPNTP with a remote WGAS . The remote WGAS communicates through the WGVPNTP to perform the same functions as a local WGAS .

Each unique service within the walled garden is preferably identified by a unique plot number. The client preferably identifies a specific walled garden service with the URL http wg . . . The plot number is preferably used as an index into the ticket and identifies a value specifying whether the user has access to the service. A walled garden service is typically implemented on a single server. However a single server can support multiple walled garden services. Accordingly a server may be identified by more than one plot number with each plot number mapping to a different site residing on the server. A single service can also reside on multiple servers such as when load balancing is being employed. In this case a single plot number may resolve to more than one server.

The GS controls access to a policy server PS . The GS preferably receives communications from the client in the form of XML and or forms via HTTP over SSL and translates the communications into database transactions using protocols such as lightweight directory access protocol LDAP SQL and open database connectivity ODBC . The GS passes the transactions to the PS and the PS accesses a database of user authorization and authentication information in response. The database contains a list of users walled gardens and services in particular walled gardens available to the users. The database does not need to be centralized and in one embodiment is distributed on a regional basis. The GS communicates with the PS to authenticate a user s identity and issue the client a ticket specifying the walled gardens and services that the user can access. The GS preferably encrypts the ticket using a secret key shared with the WGPS in order to limit potential attacks on the ticket by the user. The user s client stores the ticket and presents it to the WGPS when seeking to access a walled garden .

The Internet server is essentially the same as the WGPS except that the Internet server controls access to the Internet at large rather than to the walled garden . In a preferred embodiment the Internet server has a database for holding permissions indicating web sites that users can access and client API functions that the web sites can access. A client accesses the Internet by presenting a ticket to the Internet server specifying the Internet sites to which the user has access. In one embodiment the ticket specifies the URLs using regular expression pattern matching. The database also identifies poisoned tickets.

The keymaster provides encryption keys to the GS WGPS and Internet Server . Preferably the keymaster has SSL links or some other form of secure communication links to the servers . The keymaster generates pseudo random encryption keys and securely passes the keys to the servers . The servers use the keys to encrypt and decrypt the tickets. In a preferred embodiment the servers use symmetric encryption and use the same key to encrypt and decrypt tickets although other encryption systems can be used. Each key is valid for a predetermined time period. The keymaster issues a new key to the servers at the expiration of the previous key. Each key is preferably indexed so that the keys can be individually identified.

The entities illustrated in are not necessarily physically separate or executing on dedicated computer systems. For example the walled garden network and the network connecting the various servers may actually be a single network that is logically divided into separate networks. Moreover the various servers such as the WGPS GS and PS may actually be integrated into the proxy server or another computer system. Likewise the various databases may be implemented on a single database. Conversely the functionality ascribed to a single network server or database in the description of may actually be performed by multiple networks servers and or databases respectively. Thus illustrates logical entities and logical interconnections between the entities according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. However alternative embodiments of the present invention may have different physical structures.

The at least one processor may be any general purpose processor such as an INTEL x86 compatible or SUN MICROSYSTEMS SPARC compatible central processing unit CPU . The storage device may be any device capable of holding large amounts of data like a hard drive compact disk read only memory CD ROM DVD or some form of removable storage device. The memory holds instructions and data used by the processor . The pointing device may be a mouse track ball light pen touch sensitive display or other type of pointing device and is used in combination with the keyboard to input data into the computer system . The graphics adapter displays images and other information on the display . The network adapter couples the computer system to a local or wide area network.

Program modules for performing the functionality of the server according to one embodiment of the present invention are stored on the storage device loaded into the memory and executed by the processor . Alternatively hardware or software modules may be stored elsewhere within the computer system . In one embodiment of the present invention one or more of the illustrated servers are implemented using redundant hardware to create a high availability computer system. As is known in the art an advantage of a high availability computer system is a reduced risk of system failure.

Initially the user uses the UI on the client to request access to a service in the walled garden . For example the client may generate a UI on the TV . The user using the UI and an input device such as an IR keyboard requests access to the service through the web browsing software executing on the client . Alternatively the client may be coupled to or integrated into a computer system and the user may use web browsing software to request access to a web site in the walled garden . As mentioned above the request from the client to the WGPS preferably takes the form of a URL such as http wg . . . In one embodiment the user visits a web page or portal that references either directly or indirectly all of the available walled garden services. When the user selects a link to a particular service the web page directs the client to the proper URL.

The WGPS receives the request and determines from the URL that the client is attempting to access a restricted service in the walled garden . Assume however that this request is the first request from the client to the WGPS . As a result the client did not include a ticket with the request . Therefore the WGPS denies access to the walled garden and sends a HTTP response to challenge the client to supply the ticket in a subsequent request.

The client receives the challenge . Preferably the web browser then passes control to an authorization dynamic link library DLL executing on the client . The authorization DLL creates the appropriate UI to let the user authenticate himself or herself to the client .

The authorization DLL then establishes a SSL connection with the GS and makes a request for the ticket by sending the user authentication information as well as the Box ID of the client across the SSL connection. The GS authenticates the user by validating the authentication information against the information in the database .

If the validation is successful the GS preferably constructs the ticket. As shown in the ticket preferably includes the Box ID of the client requesting the ticket a version number an expiration date or duration when the ticket is valid an affiliation and a set of bits representing the access rights of the user . The version number is preferably a control number used by the GS to ensure that the WGPS properly interprets the ticket . The expiration date can be any time in the future or a time span when the ticket is valid and may range for example from a few minutes to a few hours. The affiliation indicates the particular walled garden or MSO to which the ticket pertains. The set of bits representing the access rights of the user are preferably organized such that certain bits correspond to certain servers sites or services within the walled garden . In one embodiment of the present invention the bits representing the access rights are run length encoded RLE to reduce the storage size of the field. Other information such as the IP address of the client and a timestamp may also be stored in the ticket .

As shown in the keymaster occasionally shares a secret key with the GS and the WGPS via an SSL connection. Returning to the GS preferably uses a symmetric encryption technique to encrypt the ticket T with the shared secret key to produce an encrypted ticket T . In an alternative embodiment the GS encrypts only the portion of the ticket containing the bits representing the user access rights . The WGPS uses the decryption key which is preferably identical to the encryption key to decrypt the ticket . In one embodiment of the present invention this encryption is performed using the data encryption standard DES . However other embodiments of the present invention may use different encryption techniques including techniques where the encryption and decryption keys differ.

The resulting encrypted ticket is passed to the client . The client preferably stores the encrypted ticket internally. Since the client does not have access to the secret key shared by the keymaster GS and WGPS the client cannot decrypt or alter the ticket.

If for any reason the GS decides to invalidate or revoke a ticket the GS poisons the ticket by sending an invalidity notice to the WGPS as shown in . The WGPS treats a request to access the walled garden made by a client with a poisoned ticket as if no ticket had been included.

Returning to the client again sends a HTTP request to the WGPS requesting access to a service in the walled garden . This time however the client includes the encrypted ticket with the HTTP request in an Authorization header. The WGPS receives the ticket with the request and determines whether the ticket grants the user access to the walled garden and walled garden service. To make this determination the WGPS uses the timestamp to determine the secret key used to encrypt the ticket. Then the WGPS uses the secret key to decrypt the ticket. Next the WGPS compares the Box ID in the ticket with the Box ID of the requesting client to ensure that the ticket was received from the correct client . The WGPS also checks the expiration date in the ticket to ensure that the ticket is still valid and compares the ticket with the information in its database to ensure that the ticket has not been poisoned.

If the above tests are satisfied then the WGPS examines the affiliation and the set of bits representing the access rights of the user to determine whether the user has rights to the specified walled garden service. To make the latter determination the WGPS extracts the plot number from the HTTP request and uses it as an index into the set of bits in the ticket . Preferably the value of the indexed bit specifies whether the user is authorized to access the walled garden service or site having the given plot number. This embodiment is preferred because it minimizes the overhead utilized to determine whether the ticket allows access. Of course alternative embodiments of the present invention may use different techniques to encode the user access rights in the ticket.

The WGPS then either grants or denies access to the user. If the WGPS grants access then it allows the user request to reach the walled garden service having the specified plot number. Accordingly the specified URL from the walled garden server will be served to the client . In this case the client downloads and executes the JAVA HTML XML and or JAVASCRIPT code providing the service as described below. Preferably the downloaded code is not persistently stored in the client . If the WGPS denies access then it sends a HTTP status response to the client with an HTTP header indicating the reason for denying access. Typically the client will respond to this denial by requesting a new ticket from the PS .

The message from the WGS to the client necessarily passes through the WGPS . Preferably a proxy plug in on the WGPS traps all messages from WGS to clients in order to attach an ACL to each message. When the WGPS traps a message it examines the header provided by the WGS for any potential security violations. For example the WGPS strips any improper headers off the message to protect against masquerading or spoofing by the WGS . Then the WGPS looks up the corresponding entry in the Walled Garden Permissions Table stored in the database and retrieves the ACL for the given service affiliation and user agent. The WGPS inserts the ACL into the message from the WGS to the client as an HTTP header. In one embodiment of the present invention the ACL is inserted into a athmAPIAuth header although other headers or transport mechanisms can be used as well.

In addition the WGPS can place information in the header that further limits the permissions contained in the ACL. For example the WGPS can restrict the WGS to accessing channel guide data for the current time only for the next hour for the next day or week etc. Similarly the WGPS can restrict the WGS to accessing channel guide data for only a certain channel or network. The WGPS preferably implements these additional limitations by placing additional fields in the HTTP header. After the headers are inserted the WGPS passes the message to the client .

The shell executing on the client extracts the ACL affiliations and any other permissions from the headers and determines whether the data grant the WGS access to the API functions called by the attendant code. The shell codifies the mapping from bit positions in the ACL to API functions and enforces the access control. If the ACL does not allow a called API function to be executed then the shell preferably returns the FAIL FUNCTION NOT AUTHORIZED message to the application or program that invoked the API function. Otherwise the shell returns the result of the function invocation.

In summary the present invention is an authentication and authorization method and system that lets individual users access one or more of the services within the walled garden . The client authentication procedure allows individual users to be authenticated. In addition the GS PS and associated database can authorize a unique set of access rights for each user. The WGPS ensures that only authenticated and authorized users are allowed to access servers within the walled garden . Moreover the design of the system including the ticket and shared secret key provides an efficient implementation thereby keeping a relatively light processing load on the GS and PS .

In addition the present invention enhances the services provided by the walled garden by allowing WGS to access the APIs of the clients. The Walled Garden Permissions table stored in the database of the WGPS allows the access rights of a WGS to be controlled with a fine degree of granularity with respect to functions time and channels networks.

By using the method and system described herein a service provider or other entity can sell subscriptions or other forms of access rights to one or more services within the walled garden .
