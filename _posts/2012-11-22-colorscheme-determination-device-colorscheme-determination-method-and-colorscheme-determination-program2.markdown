The present application is a national stage application of International Application No. PCT JP2012 007525 entitled Color Scheme Determination Device Color Scheme Determination Method and Color Scheme Determination Program filed on Nov. 22 2012 which claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP2012 043638 filed on Feb. 29 2012 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto.

The present invention relates to a color scheme determination device for judging the appropriateness of overall coloration balance on a screen and in particular to a color scheme determination device operating in consideration of the characteristics of the human visual sense.

In the designing of a screen making the design so that information important to the user stands out on the screen is a basic technique for creating an easy to use screen. As an element influencing the stand out degree degree of standing out of the information the color can be taken as an example as well as the size and the layout. Successively assigning loud colors from the loudest one to the information in descending order of the importance of the information is a commonly used method. However as the amount or the number of types pieces of information to be displayed at the same time increases substantially and the number of colors necessary for expressing the information increases accordingly just employing the above method successively assigning loud colors to the information in descending order of the importance of the information sometimes fails to let each type piece hereinafter referred to simply as type of stand out exactly according to the intention of the designer.

For example although red is a color that easily stands out as a single color the stand out degree of the red color on the whole screen when the whole screen is viewed drops when the red color is used for a lot of elements on the screen and when similar colors magenta orange etc. are also used for other types of information. As above determining the color scheme in consideration of the color balance on the whole screen is essential for letting each type of information stand out exactly according to the intention of the designer.

However determining the color scheme in consideration of the color balance on the whole screen or making an evaluation on whether the color scheme has been made in consideration of the balance on the whole screen or not is difficult for designers not having sufficient knowledge of colors and design difficult unless the designer has expert knowledge .

Non patent Literature 1 describes a technology for evaluating the method for setting the color the area etc. of each type of information when multiple types of information differing in the priority are displayed on the screen. With this technology the appropriateness of the display visualization on the screen as a whole can be evaluated in terms of a value called visualization achievement value display achievement level in consideration of the degree of attracting visual attention and the priority of each type of information on the screen.

A technology described in Non patent Literature 2 considers that the stand out degree degree of standing out of each color used on the screen can be calculated based on an attractiveness evaluation model attractiveness evaluation model that takes into account a characteristic attractiveness as the degree of attracting visual attention as a single color and a heterogeneous attractiveness as the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors . By using this technology the stand out degree of each color in consideration of the balance on the whole screen can be calculated.

Patent Literature 1 describes a technology for controlling the way of letting each region in a document stand out by varying the color and the hatching density of each region depending on the area and the degree of importance of the region. With this technology the coloration can be performed in a simple and easy manner by changing the saturation and the shade elements determining the degree of standing out as a single color depending on the area and the degree of importance of each region.

Non patent Literature 1 Yuji Kikuta Sozo Inoue Mizuho Iwaihara Information Visualization and its Evaluation using Importance and User Visibility IEICE the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers Technical Report DE2000 6 2000 05 pp. 41 48

Non patent Literature 2 Shoji Tanaka Seiji Inokuchi Yuichi Iwadate Ryohei Nakatsu An Attractiveness Evaluation Model Based on the Physical Features of Image Regions The Transactions of the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers May 2000 Vol. J83 A No. 5 pp. 576 588

In the technology described in the Non patent Literature 1 the appropriateness of the display visualization on the screen as a whole is evaluated in terms of a value called visualization achievement value display achievement level . However appropriateness of the display of each type of information on the screen is not evaluated. Therefore there is a problem that the technology cannot clarify changing the color of which type of information leads to improvement of the evaluation value.

The technology described in the Non patent Literature 2 is capable of evaluating the stand out degree degree of standing out of each used color color used on the screen on the whole screen. However since the meaning and the degree of importance of each type of information on the screen to which each color has been assigned are not taken into consideration there is a problem that it is impossible to judge whether or not each color is standing out appropriately corresponding to the meaning and the degree of importance of each type of information in the image.

In the technology described in the Patent Literature 1 each region in a document is assigned a color corresponding to the degree of importance of the region in the document in consideration of the stand out degree degree of standing out of each color as a single color. Since the balance when the document is viewed as a whole is not take into consideration even though the stand out degree of each region as a single region is adjusted there is a problem that there is a possibility that the stand out degree intended for each region cannot be realized in the document. Further since evaluation of the result of the coloration is not carried out there is a problem that achievement of an actually appropriate color scheme is not guaranteed.

It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide a color scheme determination device with which even people not expert in colors and screen design can evaluate whether or not each type piece of information constituting a screen has been colored to stand out on the whole screen appropriately corresponding to the degree of importance of the information.

According to the present invention even people not expert in colors and screen design are enabled to evaluate whether or not each type piece of information constituting a screen has been colored to stand out on the whole screen appropriately corresponding to the degree of importance of the information.

A color scheme determination device in accordance with a first exemplary embodiment exemplary embodiment 1 of the present invention will be described in detail below referring to figures. is a block diagram showing the configuration of the color scheme determination device according to this exemplary embodiment. As shown in the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment includes a color scheme information acquisition unit an attractiveness calculation unit an importance degree storage unit a color scheme appropriateness judgment unit an input unit and an output unit .

The color scheme information acquisition unit acquires color scheme information indicating all colors used on an evaluation target screen and the area of each of the colors from the evaluation target screen specified by the user of the color scheme determination device hereinafter referred to simply as the user through the input unit . In the following explanation each color is expressed by a color notation method based on an RGB value using hexadecimal numbers e.g. FF0000 . However other color notation methods may also be used as long as the color can be uniquely determined. While the area is expressed by using the number of pixels e.g. 500px in the following explanation other methods may also be used for expressing the area. The color scheme information acquisition unit determines a background color as a color having the largest area among the acquired colors. The determination of the background color may also be made by the user through the input unit .

The attractiveness calculation unit calculates an attractiveness of each color other than the background color by using color scheme information outputted by the color scheme information acquisition unit and information indicating which color corresponds to the background. The attractiveness is a value representing the degree of attracting visual attention of a human seeing each color on the evaluation target screen. In other words the attractiveness is a value evaluating the stand out degree degree of standing out of each color when the screen is viewed as a whole. Specifically the attractiveness is a value determined in consideration of the degree of attracting visual attention as a single color and the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors used on the same screen.

Next a method for calculating the attractiveness will be explained below. As described in the Non patent Literature 2 the attractiveness calculation unit converts each color into values coordinates in the HLS color model and then calculates values representing the degree of attracting visual attention as a single color stand out degree He due to the hue H of the target color and stand out degree R due to the lightness L of the target color for each target color according to the expressions 1 3 shown below. Then the summation PC of the stand out degree He the stand out degree R and the saturation S of the target color is calculated according to the following expression 4 for example 

The degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors used on the same screen is determined by for example converting each color into values coordinates in the CIEL a b color system and then calculating the value HC in the following expression 5 by using a color difference d defined as the distance from the average color to each color in the color space as described in the Non patent Literature 1 The values L a b of the average color are calculated by for example multiplying each of the L a and b values of each color by the area of the use of the color having the values adding up the multiplied values for all the colors and dividing the sums by the total area. The value HC can be calculated with higher accuracy by considering the area in the calculation of the average color.

The attractiveness is calculated by for example directly adding up the value PC of the degree of attracting visual attention as a single color and the value HC of the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors used on the same screen. The attractiveness calculation unit may also employ other methods for the calculation of the attractiveness such as performing the addition after multiplying each of the values PC and HC by a prescribed coefficient.

The importance degree storage unit holds information on the colors on the evaluation target screen other than the background color and an importance degree degree of importance which has been set for each of the colors. The information on the importance degree is expressed as a score 100 points 80 points 20 points etc. . The importance degree has been set in consideration of the meaning of information to which each color has been assigned from the viewpoint of importance of the information to the user viewing the screen for example.

The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges the appropriateness of the color scheme by comparing the value of the importance degree of each color held by the importance degree storage unit with the value of the attractiveness of each color outputted by the attractiveness calculation unit . Specifically the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit calculates the ordinal rank of each color in the importance degree and in the attractiveness and compares the importance degree ordinal rank with the attractiveness ordinal rank in regard to the same color for example. Then the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges that the color is appropriate in the color scheme if the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank coincide with each other. If the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank do not coincide with each other the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges that the color is inappropriate in the color scheme.

When the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank coincide with each other for all the colors the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit may also make a judgment by use of a relative attractiveness in consideration of whether relative magnitude of the importance degree of each color as compared with the importance degrees of the other used colors is comparable to relative magnitude of the attractiveness of the color as compared with the attractiveness of the other used colors. For example the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit calculates an attractiveness ratio of each color by dividing the value of the attractiveness of the color by the value of the importance degree of the color. Then the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit compares the attractiveness ratio of the color having the highest importance degree with the attractiveness ratio of each color and judges each color to be appropriate if the two attractiveness ratios are comparable to each other or to be inappropriate otherwise. The judgment on whether the two attractiveness ratios are comparable to each other or not is made based on whether the difference from the attractiveness ratio of the color having the highest attractiveness is within a prescribed value or not for example. The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit may make this judgment by using a value other than the attractiveness ratio as long as the judgment is made by use of a relative attractiveness.

The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit outputs at least the result of the judgment of the color scheme appropriateness of each color. The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit may also output the value of the importance degree corresponding to each color and the value of the attractiveness of each color in addition to the color scheme appropriateness judgment result of each color. Further the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit may also output a judgment result regarding the whole screen based on the color scheme appropriateness judgment results of the colors. The judgment result regarding the whole screen is set at appropriate if the color scheme appropriateness judgment results of the colors are all appropriate or set at inappropriate otherwise for example.

The input unit receives operations by the user such as an operation for designating the evaluation target screen. The input unit may be implemented by an input device such as a mouse a keyboard or a touch panel.

The output unit displays the judgment result of each color outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit . The output unit may be implemented by a display device such as a display.

First the user designates the evaluation target screen through the input unit step S . The color scheme information acquisition unit acquires the color scheme information indicating all colors on the evaluation target screen and the area of each of the colors from the evaluation target screen step S . Further the color scheme information acquisition unit determines a color having the largest area as the background color step S . Subsequently by using the color scheme information and information specifying the background color the attractiveness calculation unit calculates the attractiveness of the colors other than the background color step S .

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit calculates the attractiveness ordinal ranks of the colors other than the background color by using the information on the attractiveness of the colors other than the background color step S . Further the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit calculates the importance degree ordinal ranks of the colors by using the importance degree information the information on the importance degree which has been set for each color held by the importance degree storage unit step S . Then the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit substitutes 1 into a variable i step S .

For a color i as the i th color the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges whether or not the importance degree ordinal rank of the color i coincides with the attractiveness ordinal rank of the color i step S . If the judgment in the step S is affirmative YES the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges the color i as appropriate step S . If the judgment in the step S is negative NO the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges the color i as inappropriate step S . After the judgment on the color i in the step S or S is finished the variable is incremented by 1 step S .

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit checks whether the judgment is finished for all the colors other than the background color step S . Specifically the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit in the step S judges whether or not i is greater than the number of the colors on the screen other than the background color. If negative S NO the sequence of the steps S S is repeated for the incremented variable i. If affirmative YES in the step S the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit outputs information including the judgment result to the output unit step S . The output unit displays the information including the judgment result. When the step S is finished the color scheme determination process is ended.

In the above explanation of the operation of the color scheme determination device with reference to the judgment on the appropriateness of each color by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit is made based on the comparison between the importance degree ordinal rank of the color and the attractiveness ordinal rank of the color based on whether the two ordinal ranks coincide with each other . However the aforementioned judgment by use of the relative attractiveness e.g. the attractiveness ratio in consideration of whether the relative magnitude of the importance degree of each color as compared with the importance degrees of the other used colors is comparable to the relative magnitude of the attractiveness of the color as compared with the attractiveness of the other used colors may also be made in addition to the judgment on whether the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank coincide with each other.

Next an example of the color scheme determination device according to the first exemplary embodiment will be described below referring to the flow chart of and explanatory drawings of . Incidentally the RGB values in the following explanation are used just as examples and thus the RGB values do not necessarily coincide with the actual colors in the drawings. is an explanatory drawing showing an example of the evaluation target screen. On the map shown in a destination a nearest station and railways roads and the background are displayed in different colors. Therefore the number of colors used on the map is four. Each color used for each type or piece hereinafter referred to simply as type of information on the map is expressed as an RGB value in this example. For example a color FF0000 is used as the color representing the destination a color 0000FF is used as the color representing the nearest station and the railways a color FF6600 is used as the color representing the roads and a color FFFFFF is used as the color representing the background .

When the map is designated as the evaluation target screen by the user through the input unit step S the color scheme information acquisition unit acquires information on all the colors used on the map and the area of each of the colors as the color scheme information step S . Further the color scheme information acquisition unit determines a color having the largest area as the background color step S .

Subsequently the attractiveness calculation unit calculates the attractiveness of the colors other than the background color by using the color scheme information on the map and the information specifying the background color outputted by the color scheme information acquisition unit step S . The attractiveness is calculated by adding a characteristic attractiveness as the degree of attracting visual attention as a single color and a heterogeneous attractiveness as the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors used on the same screen together. The characteristic attractiveness is calculated by using the hue the saturation and the lightness of the target color. The heterogeneous attractiveness is calculated by using the information on the colors and areas of the colors including the background color. Specifically the heterogeneous attractiveness is calculated by using the color difference defined as the distance from the average color to each color in the color space.

In this example the characteristic attractiveness of the colors are calculated as 3.0 for the color FF0000 2.7 for the color 0000FF and 2.3 for the color FF6600. The heterogeneous attractiveness of the colors are calculated as 1.7 for the color FF0000 2.1 for the color 0000FF and 0.6 for the color FF6600. Consequently the attractiveness are calculated as 4.7 for the color FF0000 4.8 for the color 0000FF and 2.9 for the color FF6600.

By the color scheme determination device of this example not only the stand out degree the degree of standing out of each color as a single color but also the stand out degree of each color in consideration of color balance when the screen is viewed as a whole can be digitized by using the heterogeneous attractiveness as an element of the attractiveness.

When the attractiveness of the colors other than the background color are outputted by the attractiveness calculation unit the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit sets ordinal ranks to the attractiveness based on the data from the attractiveness calculation unit step S . is an explanatory drawing showing an example of a data structure including the ordinal ranks of the attractiveness of the colors generated by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit . The attractiveness of the colors FF0000 0000FF and FF6600 are 4.7 second highest 4.8 highest and 2.9 lowest Therefore the ordinal ranks of the attractiveness of the colors FF0000 0000FF and FF6600 shown in the data item are 2 1 and 3 respectively.

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit refers to the importance degree information the information on the importance degree which has been set for each color held by the importance degree storage unit . is an explanatory drawing showing an example of a data structure including the importance degree information on the colors held by the importance degree storage unit . The ID in the data item represents a serial number of data held by the importance degree storage unit . The COLOR RGB in the data item represents the RGB value of the color assigned to each type of information. The IMPORTANCE DEGREE in the data item represents the degree of importance importance degree of the information to which the color indicated in the same line has been assigned for the user viewing the map. The value in the data item increases with the increase in the degree of importance. The MEANING OF INFORMATION in the data item represents the meaning of the information to which the color indicated in the same line has been assigned.

The calculation of the importance degree indicated in the data item will be explained concretely. It can be considered that the destination is the information having the highest importance degree for the user viewing the map the nearest station having a high probability of being the starting point for the user is of the second highest importance degree and the information on the roads is of the lowest importance degree. Therefore the importance degree of the information DESTINATION to which the color FF0000 has been assigned is set at the highest value e.g. 100 . The importance degree of the information NEAREST STATION RAILWAY to which the color 0000FF has been assigned is set at the second highest value e.g. 80 . The importance degree of the information ROAD to which the color FF6600 has been assigned is set at the lowest value e.g. 20 .

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit sets ordinal ranks to the importance degrees of the colors other than the background color step S . is an explanatory drawing showing an example of a data structure including the ordinal ranks of the importance degrees of the colors generated by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit . The ORDINAL RANK OF IMPORTANCE DEGREE in the data item represents the ordinal rank of the importance degree of each color. In the importance degree information held by the importance degree storage unit the importance degree corresponding to the color FF0000 is the highest 100 the importance degree corresponding to the color 0000FF is the second highest 80 and the importance degree corresponding to the color FF6600 is the lowest 20 as mentioned above. Therefore the ordinal ranks of the importance degrees of the colors FF0000 0000FF and FF6600 are 1 2 and 3 respectively.

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit compares the importance degree ordinal rank the ordinal rank of the importance degree with the attractiveness ordinal rank the ordinal rank of the attractiveness in regard to each color and judges each color as appropriate if the two ordinal ranks coincide with each other or as inappropriate otherwise step S step S . is an explanatory drawing showing an example of a data structure including the result of the judgment outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit . The JUDGMENT RESULT in the data item represents the result of the comparison between the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank in regard to each color.

Regarding the color FF0000 the attractiveness ordinal rank is 2 whereas the importance degree ordinal rank is 1. Since the two ordinal ranks do not coincide with each other the judgment result in the data item is set at inappropriate . Regarding the color 0000FF the attractiveness ordinal rank is 1 whereas the importance degree ordinal rank is 2. Since the two ordinal ranks do not coincide with each other the judgment result in the data item is set at inappropriate . Regarding the color FF6600 both the attractiveness ordinal rank and the importance degree ordinal rank are 3. Since the two ordinal ranks coincide with each other the judgment result in the data item is set at appropriate .

The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit outputs information including the judgment result to the output unit step S . The output unit displays the information including the judgment result. is an explanatory drawing showing an example of a graph indicating the information including the judgment result displayed by the output unit . The output unit may display the information in various ways a table like a graph like etc. . The user viewing the judgment result etc. displayed by the output unit can learn whether or not the color scheme on the evaluation target screen screen as the target of the judgment has been made so that each color stands out appropriately corresponding to the ordinal rank of the importance degree of the information.

As above the color scheme determination device according to this exemplary embodiment compares the attractiveness ordinal rank the ordinal rank of the attractiveness with the importance degree ordinal rank the ordinal rank of the importance degree in regard to each color on the screen and judges each color as appropriate if the two ordinal ranks coincide with each other or as inappropriate if the two ordinal ranks do not coincide with each other. The attractiveness of each color is a value determined in consideration of both the degree of attracting visual attention as a single color and the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors used on the same screen. Therefore the user is enabled to evaluate whether each type of information on the screen has been colored to stand out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information or not while taking into consideration the color balance when the screen is viewed as a whole. Further since the judgment result is outputted for each color the user can evaluate which of the colors used on the screen is inappropriate. Furthermore the above evaluation can be made even when the user is not an expert in the screen design.

Next another example of the color scheme determination device according to the first exemplary embodiment will be described below referring to the flow chart of and . In this example the operation in the steps S S in and the output results shown in are identical with those in the above example and thus repeated explanation thereof is omitted for brevity.

In this example the nearest station having a high probability of being the starting point for the user is considered to be the information having the highest importance degree for the user viewing the map . Then the importance degrees have been set based on the idea that the information on the destination is of the next highest importance and the information on the roads is of the lowest importance. Therefore the importance degree of the information NEAREST STATION RAILWAY to which the color 0000FF has been assigned is set at the highest value 100 the importance degree of the information DESTINATION to which the color FF0000 has been assigned is set at the second highest value 80 and the importance degree of the information ROAD to which the color FF6600 has been assigned is set at the lowest value 20 .

The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit refers to the importance degree information held by the importance degree storage unit and thereby sets the ordinal ranks to the colors step S . is an explanatory drawing showing another example of the data structure including the ordinal ranks of the importance degrees of the colors generated by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit . The ORDINAL RANK OF IMPORTANCE DEGREE in the data item represents the ordinal rank of the importance degree of each color. In the importance degree information held by the importance degree storage unit the importance degree corresponding to the color 0000FF is the highest 100 the importance degree corresponding to the color FF0000 is the second highest 80 and the importance degree corresponding to the color FF6600 is the lowest 20 . Therefore the ordinal ranks of the importance degrees of the colors FF0000 0000FF and FF6600 are 2 1 and 3 respectively.

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit compares the importance degree ordinal rank the ordinal rank of the importance degree with the attractiveness ordinal rank the ordinal rank of the attractiveness in regard to each color step S step S . In this example the importance degree ordinal rank coincides with the attractiveness ordinal rank in regard to all of the colors. In this case where the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank coincide with each other for all of the colors the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit may calculate the attractiveness ratio obtained by dividing the value of the attractiveness by the value of the importance degree for each color. In this case the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit makes a judgment on the appropriateness of the color scheme based on whether the attractiveness ratio of each color is comparable to the attractiveness ratio of the color having the highest importance degree and outputs the result of the judgment. For example the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges whether the difference from the attractiveness ratio of the color having the highest attractiveness is within a prescribed value or not and sets the judgment result at appropriate if the difference is within the prescribed value or at inappropriate otherwise. The color scheme appropriateness judgment unit outputs the judgment result to the output unit step S .

The judgment result regarding the color scheme appropriateness may be expressed as for example evaluation values of the colors each of which is obtained by converting the attractiveness ratio of each color in a way in which the attractiveness ratio of the color having the highest importance degree becomes 100. In this case a color having an evaluation value closer to 100 can be considered to have been judged to have higher color scheme appropriateness. When the evaluation value of a color is higher than 100 the color can be considered to have a high attractiveness as compared with the value of the importance degree. In contrast a color having a low evaluation value can be considered to have a low attractiveness as compared with the value of the importance degree.

It is assumed in this example that the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges that the color scheme for a color is appropriate if the attractiveness ratio of the color is within 25 of the attractiveness ratio of the color having the highest importance degree. Since the attractiveness ratio of the color 0000FF having the highest importance degree is 0.048 the color scheme for a color is judged to be APPROPRIATE if the attractiveness ratio of the color is 0.036 or more and 0.060 or less 0.048 25 or to be INAPPROPRIATE otherwise. Thus the judgment results for the colors FF0000 attractiveness ratio 0.059 and 0000FF attractiveness ratio 0.048 are APPROPRIATE FF6600 attractiveness ratio 0.145 is INAPPROPRIATE respectively.

A color having a high attractiveness ratio can be considered to be a color to which the magnitude of the attractiveness as compared with the value of the importance degree has been set high. In contrast a color having a low attractiveness ratio can be considered to be a color to which the magnitude of the attractiveness as compared with the value of the importance degree has been set low. Therefore the color scheme determination device in this exemplary embodiment is capable of not only judging whether the stand out degree the degree of standing out of each color coincides with the ordinal rank of the importance degree of the color or not but also judging whether the stand out degree of each color coincides also with the magnitude of the importance degree of the color to some extent or not by making the above described judgment based on the attractiveness ratio.

Subsequently the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit outputs the judgment result regarding each color to the output unit . The output unit displays the judgment result. The output unit may display the judgment result in various methods a table like a graph etc. .

Incidentally while the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment calculates the attractiveness of the used colors other than the background color by use of the background color as a color having the largest area or a color specified by the user appropriateness of the background color is not handled as an object of the judgment. However the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment may make the appropriateness judgment also on the background color e.g. judgment on whether a color that is not eye friendly with saturation exceeding a prescribed value is used for the background or not and present the result of the judgment.

As descried above in the color scheme determination device according to this exemplary embodiment the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit judges whether each color used on the screen has been colored set to stand out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree or not by comparing the stand out degree of each color when the screen is viewed as a whole with the magnitude of the importance degree which has been set corresponding to each color. Therefore even a user not having expert knowledge of colors and design is enabled to evaluate whether each type of information on the screen has been colored to stand out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information or not while taking into consideration the color balance when the screen is viewed as a whole. Further since the judgment result about the color scheme appropriateness is displayed for each color used on the screen the user can learn which of the colors used on the screen is inappropriate.

Furthermore the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment makes the comparison between the attractiveness ordinal rank and the importance degree ordinal rank in regard to each color on the screen and further makes the judgment using the attractiveness ratio when the two ordinal ranks coincide with each other for all of the colors. Therefore the user can make the judgment on whether each type of information on the screen has been colored to stand out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information or not based on not only whether the stand out degree the degree of standing out of each color coincides with the ordinal rank of the importance degree of the color or not but also whether the stand out degree of each color coincides also with the magnitude of the importance degree of the color to some extent or not.

A color scheme determination device in accordance with a second exemplary embodiment exemplary embodiment 2 of the present invention will be described in detail below referring to figures. is a block diagram showing the configuration of the color scheme determination device in accordance with the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the following explanation components equivalent to those in the color scheme determination device of the first exemplary embodiment shown in are assigned the same reference characters as in and repeated explanation thereof is omitted for brevity.

As shown in the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment comprises an improvement plan generation unit which is the difference from the color scheme determination device of the first exemplary embodiment shown in . The other components of the color scheme determination device are equivalent to those of the color scheme determination device of the first exemplary embodiment.

The improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan in which the colors judged to be inappropriate have been changed by referring to the judgment result about the color scheme appropriateness of each color the value of the importance degree of each color and the value of the attractiveness of each color outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit . Specifically the improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan in which the colors judged to be inappropriate have been interchanged for example. The interchanging of the colors judged to be inappropriate is performed in a way in which the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank coincide with each other for each of the colors. After finishing generating the improvement plan the improvement plan generation unit outputs data of the improvement plan in which the color scheme before the improvement and the color scheme in the improvement plan are associated with each other to the output unit . Any color notation method may be used for representing each color as long as the color can be uniquely determined. For example an RGB value using hexadecimal numbers e.g. FF0000 is used.

In the color scheme determination process in the second exemplary embodiment after the judgment result is outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit step S the improvement plan generation unit generates the improvement plan through the color change step S and outputs the generated improvement plan to the output unit step S . Steps other than the steps S and S are equivalent to those in the first exemplary embodiment.

Next an example of the color scheme determination device according to the second exemplary embodiment will be described below referring to a flow chart of and . It is assumed that the table shown in has been outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit as the judgment result about the color scheme appropriateness of the map designated as the evaluation target screen. The improvement plan generation unit generates the improvement plan regarding the color scheme by using the judgment result outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit step S . Specifically the improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan in which the colors judged to be inappropriate by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit have been changed. Since the colors FF0000 and 0000FF have been judged to be inappropriate in this example the improvement plan generation unit makes the adjustment in a way in which the attractiveness ordinal ranks and the importance degree ordinal ranks of the colors coincide with each other by changing the two colors. The coincidence between the importance degree ordinal ranks and the attractiveness ordinal ranks can be achieved by interchanging the assignments of the two colors since the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank of the color FF0000 are 1 and 2 and those of the color 0000FF are 2 and 1.

The improvement plan generation unit outputs the contents of the generated improvement plan to the output unit step S . The output unit displays the outputted contents of the improvement plan. The contents of the improvement plan displayed by the output unit may either be a table like the one shown in or a screen generated by changing the color scheme in the evaluation target screen according to the improvement plan.

As described above the color scheme determination device according to this exemplary embodiment not only makes the color scheme appropriateness judgment on the evaluation target screen but also presents the improvement plan indicating an appropriate way of changing colors in the evaluation target screen that leads to a color scheme achieving the coincidence between the attractiveness ordinal ranks and the importance degree ordinal ranks to the user of the system. This allows the user of the system not only to evaluate the color scheme but also to build the improvement plan.

Next another example of the color scheme determination device according to the second exemplary embodiment will be described below referring to the flow chart of and . is an explanatory drawing showing another example of the data structure including the contents of the improvement outputted by the improvement plan generation unit .

Similarly to the above example it is assumed that the table shown in has been outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit as the judgment result about the color scheme appropriateness of the map designated as the evaluation target screen. The improvement plan generation unit generates the improvement plan regarding the color scheme by using the evaluation result outputted by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit step S . Specifically the improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan in which the colors judged to be inappropriate by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit have been changed.

It is assumed in this example that no major change in the tint is allowed for the information DESTINATION NEAREST STATION RAILWAY and ROAD on the map evaluation target screen in order to maintain the display consistency with other maps. In this case the generation of the improvement plan that interchanges the colors judged to be inappropriate as in the policy in the above example can be considered to be inappropriate. Therefore adjustment of the attractiveness is made in this example by changing at least one of the saturation and the lightness while substantially maintaining the tint by maintaining the hue.

In the adjustment of the attractiveness in this example the improvement plan generation unit changes one of the saturation and the lightness by a prescribed value for example. Since the colors FF0000 and 0000FF have been judged to be inappropriate in this example the improvement plan generation unit makes adjustment so that the attractiveness ordinal ranks and the importance degree ordinal ranks coincide with each other by changing the saturation or the lightness of the two colors by prescribed values. The improvement plan generation unit adjusts the color FF0000 so as to increase its attractiveness since the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank of the color FF0000 are 1 and 2 respectively. The improvement plan generation unit adjusts the color 0000FF so as to decrease its attractiveness since the importance degree ordinal rank and the attractiveness ordinal rank of the color 0000FF are 2 and 1 respectively.

The color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment may perform the attractiveness calculation by the attractiveness calculation unit and the color scheme appropriateness judgment by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit also on the screen colored according to the improvement plan generated by the improvement plan generation unit by having the color scheme information acquisition unit input the screen as the next evaluation target screen. This operation allows the color scheme determination device to verify whether the color scheme in the improvement plan is appropriate or not. In this case the color scheme determination device may repeat the generation of the improvement plan by the improvement plan generation unit and the judgment by the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit until all the colors used in the improvement plan are judged to be appropriate.

As described above the color scheme determination device according to this exemplary embodiment evaluates whether each type of information on the screen has been colored to stand out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information or not while taking into consideration the color balance when the screen is viewed as a whole and further outputs an improvement plan in which the color scheme has been changed based on the result of the evaluation. Therefore even a user not having knowledge of colors and design is enabled to build an improvement plan in which a change has been made in each color not standing out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information on the screen.

The color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment generates an improvement plan in which the attractiveness has been adjusted by changing the saturation and the lightness for example for each color not standing out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree when the screen is viewed as a whole. Since it becomes possible to make the adjustment of the attractiveness while maintaining the tint by maintaining the hue the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment is usable also for screens on which a meaning is attached to a certain tint e.g. cases where a reddish color is used for warning information .

Further the color scheme determination device of this exemplary embodiment is also capable of verifying the appropriateness of the generated improvement plan in cases where the screen colored according to the improvement plan is inputted as the next evaluation target screen by the color scheme information acquisition unit . Therefore the user is enabled to build an appropriate coloration plan in which each type of information on the screen is colored to stand out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information with higher precision.

The above exemplary embodiments have also disclosed the following color scheme determination devices 1 7 

 1 A color scheme determination device e.g. the color scheme determination device or comprising an input unit e.g. the input unit which receives designation of an evaluation target screen by a user a color scheme information acquisition unit e.g. the color scheme information acquisition unit which acquires color scheme information including data regarding all colors used for information displayed on the evaluation target screen an attractiveness calculation unit e.g. the attractiveness calculation unit which calculates an attractiveness representing the degree of attracting visual attention in regard to each of the used colors by using the color scheme information an importance degree storage unit e.g. the importance degree storage unit which holds importance degree information representing a relative degree of importance of each of the used colors and corresponding to information for which each of the used colors is used a color scheme appropriateness judgment unit e.g. the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit which calculates ordinal rank of the importance degree information associated with each of the used colors based on the magnitude of the importance degree information calculates ordinal rank of the attractiveness associated with each of the used colors based on the magnitude of the attractiveness and outputs a judgment result indicating whether or not the ordinal rank of the importance degree information associated with each of the used colors coincides with the ordinal rank of the attractiveness associated with the used color and an output unit the output unit which displays the judgment result.

 2 The color scheme information includes the area of information displayed on the evaluation target screen. The attractiveness calculation unit calculates a heterogeneous attractiveness as the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors used on the evaluation target screen in regard to each of the used colors by using the color scheme information and calculates an attractiveness including the heterogeneous attractiveness.

With such a color scheme determination device the heterogeneous attractiveness can be calculated precisely since the heterogeneous attractiveness is calculated by using the areas. Further since the attractiveness including the heterogeneous attractiveness is calculated it is possible to determine an attractiveness in consideration of the degree of attracting visual attention as compared with other colors.

 3 The color scheme information includes the area of information displayed on the evaluation target screen. The color scheme information acquisition unit determines a background color as one of the used colors that is used for information having the largest area among the information displayed on the evaluation target screen. The attractiveness calculation unit calculates the attractiveness representing the degree of attracting visual attention in regard to each of the colors used for the information on the evaluation target screen by using information specifying the background color.

With such a color scheme determination device the heterogeneous attractiveness can be calculated more precisely through the calculation of the attractiveness in consideration of the background color.

 4 When the ordinal rank of the importance degree information coincides with the ordinal rank of the attractiveness in regard to all the colors used on the evaluation target screen the color scheme appropriateness judgment unit calculates a relative attractiveness as an index for judging difference between relative magnitude of the importance degree as compared with the importance degrees of the other used colors and relative magnitude of the attractiveness as compared with the attractiveness of the other used colors in regard to each of the used colors by using the values of the attractiveness and the values of the importance degree and judges whether the difference is within a prescribed value or not.

With such a color scheme determination device it is possible not only to judge whether the stand out degree the degree of standing out of each color coincides with the ordinal rank of the importance degree of the color or not but also to judge whether the stand out degree of each color coincides also with the magnitude of the importance degree of the color to some extent or not.

 5 The color scheme determination device e.g. the color scheme determination device may be configured to comprise an improvement plan generation unit e.g. the improvement plan generation unit . When there exists a used color for which the ordinal rank of the importance degree and the ordinal rank of the attractiveness do not coincide with each other the improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan indicating a color scheme in which the used color has been changed so that the ordinal rank of the importance degree and the ordinal rank of the attractiveness coincide with each other.

With such a color scheme determination device even a user not having knowledge of colors and design is enabled to build an improvement plan in which a change has been made in each color not standing out appropriately corresponding to the importance degree of the information on the screen.

 6 When there exist used colors for which the ordinal rank of the importance degree and the ordinal rank of the attractiveness do not coincide with each other the improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan indicating a color scheme in which the used colors have been interchanged so that the ordinal rank of the importance degree and the ordinal rank of the attractiveness coincide with each other.

 7 When there exists a used color for which the ordinal rank of the importance degree and the ordinal rank of the attractiveness does not coincide with each other the improvement plan generation unit generates an improvement plan indicating a color scheme in which at least saturation or lightness of the used color has been adjusted without changing hue of the used color so that the ordinal rank of the importance degree and the ordinal rank of the attractiveness coincide with each other.

With such a color scheme determination device it becomes possible to make the adjustment of the attractiveness while maintaining the tint by maintaining the hue. Therefore the color scheme determination device is usable also in cases where a meaning is attached to a particular tint e.g. cases where a reddish color is used for warning information .
