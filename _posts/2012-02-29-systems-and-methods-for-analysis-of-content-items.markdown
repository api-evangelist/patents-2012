Computing devices have become widely available in recent years. Examples of computing devices are laptops tablets and smart phones. Typically a wide variety of software and or applications are implemented on the computing devices. The most prevalent software is web based browsers that offer access to the internet and all of the content sources available via the Internet e.g. website . The content items available via web based browsers and the Internet is for example news e.g. local newspaper news stations BBC CNN etc. blogs e.g. personal or business commentary social media e.g. FACEBOOK TWITTER MYSPACE etc. informational websites e.g. WIKIPEDIA HOWSTUFFWORKS and on line retail e.g. AMAZON OVERSTOCK EBAY etc. . The content items on these websites may be direct contributions from a business and in some cases comments submitted by visitors to the business website. Other website content items may be from multiple contributors e.g. articles on a news website or from an individual contributor e.g. blogs . These websites often offer comment sections for readers to comment on the content items e.g. new stories products blogs . Social media websites offer subscribers an interactive way to share information and photos.

Businesses may implement software to measure traffic on their business website. The software may measure the number of visits to their business website the links within the business website that a visitor accesses time spent on the business website or the types of advertisements that load on the business website for example. The measurement of website traffic is useful to marketers wanting to measure the effects of an advertising campaign for example. The measurement of website traffic may also provide useful information to a business owner for implementing improvements to their business website. For example a business may have recently implemented a new print media marketing campaign or have several news stories associated with the business. In the timeframe of the start of the campaign or the news stories the business website traffic may change e.g. increase or decrease . Based the website traffic changes the marketers may infer that the print campaign or the news stories caused the website traffic change.

However while the information from measuring traffic on a website is useful there is no direct correlation to content items on other content sources e.g. social media sites blogs retail websites etc . Many of the content sources described above have millions of subscribers or readers. The sheer magnitude of information available from these websites for data mining makes the sites described above very valuable to businesses wanting to analyze content items associated with a specific product or topic.

Various embodiments of methods and systems for analyzing content items are presented. In some embodiments a plurality of content items are retrieved from one or more content sources. In some embodiments each of the plurality of content items comprises a corresponding date and time assigned when the respective one of the plurality of content items is published on a content source. In some embodiments a frequency count for each of a plurality of terms within the plurality of content items is determined for a specified time period. In some embodiments determining the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms within the plurality of content items for the specified time period further comprises indexing the terms in the content items. In some embodiments changes in the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms relative to a respective baseline frequency count for the respective one of the plurality of terms are identified. In some embodiments the baseline frequency is the average frequency count of the terms over a baseline time period. In alternate embodiments the baseline frequency count is a frequency count of a selected time period.

In some embodiments a report representing the change in the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms is generated. In some embodiments the change in frequency count for one or more of the plurality of terms within the plurality of content items for the specified time period is displayed. In some embodiments a selection of one of the plurality of terms is received. In some embodiments the selection filters the plurality of content items. In some embodiments the frequency count for the one or more of the plurality of terms from the plurality of content items filtered with the selection is re displayed.

While the invention is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description.

As discussed in more detail below provided in some embodiments are systems and methods for analyzing content items. In some embodiments a plurality of content items is retrieved from one or more content sources. In some embodiments each of the plurality of content items retrieved from the one or more content sources comprises a corresponding date and time assigned when the respective one of the plurality of content items is published on the content source. In some embodiments a frequency count for each of a plurality of terms within the plurality of content items for a specified time period is determined. The change in the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms relative to a respective baseline frequency count for the respective one of the plurality of times is identified. A report representing the change in the frequency count for each of the plurality of the terms is generated in some embodiments. In some embodiments receiving a selection of one of the plurality of terms causes the content items to be filtered with the selection. In some embodiments the frequency count for the one or more of the plurality of terms from the content items is re displayed.

For example a business may implement a marketing campaign for a product in several popular magazines. The business may then note a change in the accesses to the website and an improved conversion rate for sales of the product. The time period may correlate to the launch of the magazine marketing campaign. The marketer may wish to have direct correlation between aspects of the marketing campaign and the conversion rate. To achieve the direct correlation the comment section of the business website associated with the product may be analyzed along with social media sources and content sources that provide product reviews. The terms for the content analysis may be the product name the business name or descriptive terms associated with the product. A search of the content sources described above may locate 500 individual content items comprising the terms over a single 24 hour time period corresponding to the launch of the marketing campaign. The frequency count of each of a plurality of terms within the content items may then be determined. The results may be compared to the frequency count of terms within content from one or more time periods preceding the launch of the marketing campaign. The results may then be graphically presented such that color and or font size indicate the direction and magnitude of the change in the frequency of occurrence between the two time periods of interest. Selecting the term with the largest magnitude of change for example filters the content items with the selected terms. Selecting multiple terms in succession will continue to filter the content items such that quantity of actual content items filtered with the terms may be narrowed to an easily reviewable level for example. The marketer may then directly correlate content to the successful and or unsuccessful aspects of the marketing campaign.

In another example a marketer or business analyst may be in the planning stages of a marketing campaign or product placement intended for the time frame of a major sporting event e.g. football s SUPER BOWL or baseball s WORLD SERIES . The analyst may use a content analyzer to search content posted during the two week period leading up to the sporting event. The content items posted during the time period may be analyzed to determine the frequency count of the terms within in the content items from the two week time period. The frequency count of terms within the content items may be used to determining the best opportunities for a successful marketing campaign for future sporting events.

In some embodiments content source in is one or more web pages viewable via a web based browser hosted on one or more local computing devices host servers or other computing devices world wide. The web pages accessible via internet may be accessed by multiple users or subscribers for example. Examples of content source are news websites e.g. BBC CNN social media websites e.g. TWITTER FACEBOOK blogs e.g. personal websites retail websites e.g. EBAY AMAZON OVERSTOCK and informational websites e.g. WIKIPEDIA . Each content source may have multiple web pages for displaying the content items in some embodiments. It has been estimated that the number of individual websites numbers in the billions e.g. as indexed by search engine GOOGLE .

In some embodiments content analyzer is implemented on one or more computing devices. Content analyzer may be configured to retrieve a plurality of content items from one or more content sources for example. As described above the plurality of content items may be from news sources blogs retail websites and or social media sites. The plurality of content item may be by way of non limiting example articles product reviews customer and or reader comments or subscriber content e.g. TWEETS or FACEBOOK posts shared between subscribers . While the examples of content sources presented herein are discussed with respect to web sites or other content on the world wide web one of skill in the art will readily ascertain in light of having read the present disclosure that the invention is not so limited and that systems other than the web e.g. SMS messaging email or other content and message systems yet to be invented fall within the scope and intent of the present disclosure. In some embodiments the plurality of content items may be retrieved for a given time period. A time period may be a day an hour a week for example. The content items may have a date and time associated with the content item is published or posted for example. In some embodiments the frequency count of terms within the plurality of content items are determined. Terms may be single words or phrases for example. In some embodiments non contributing terms such as the or a are not included in the count.

In some embodiments a report is generated to display the frequency count. The displayed frequency count may indicate the magnitude of the frequency of occurrence for example. In some embodiments the font size of the displayed terms may indicate the magnitude of the frequency count. In some embodiments the displayed terms are selectable and cause further filtering of the content items to content items comprising the selected term. The frequency count from the filtered content items may then be re displayed for example. In some embodiments the content sources are selectable or determined by the user. In some embodiments the displayed report includes options to select the content source or allows the user to determine the content source. Selecting the content source displays the content items comprising the selected terms. In some embodiments to facilitate accessing the content items from the content source the content analyzer indexes the terms in addition to the frequency count of each term. In some embodiments indexing the terms comprises storing information comprising the frequency count the content item and the content source associated with the term.

For example a marketer may have implemented a new marketing campaign for a product. The marketers may monitor multiple content sources for mentions of the product e.g. content items . On the day after the new marketing campaign was implemented the marketer may wish to assess the impact of the new marketing campaign. The marketer may use a content analyzer to retrieve content items with the product name from that day e.g. time period from content sources. The content analyzer may index the terms and determine a frequency count in the retrieved content items for that day. The frequency count may be compared to a pre determined average frequency count. Terms with the highest change frequency count may indicate a trend in the content items. For example the terms like better and service may be the most frequent terms. The marketer may select better and the content analyzer filters the content to show the frequency count of terms within content items that comprises both the product name and the term better . In the filtered content items e.g. filtered with the product name and better the marketer may select a content source and read the content items that has both the product name and better in it.

From the content items filtered with the selected term better and the product name the marketer may determine that the trend in the content items is that the product is better or improved. In addition the marketer may notice in the same view of the display comprising the filtered information that the term service continues to have a high frequency count in the content items filtered with the selected term better and the product name. The marketer may select the term service to further filter the content items to content items comprising the term service . The filtered content items may indicate that terms such as bad poor inattentive are terms with the highest frequency count. The marketer may then select a content source to review the filtered content e.g. content that is filtered with the product name better and service so that the reviews may be fed back to customer service.

In some embodiments analytics server as discussed above monitors traffic. The onsite traffic information may include the number of accesses to the website or to given links on the website for example. The offsite traffic information may include monitoring trends on given websites or the internet as a whole for example. In some embodiments the trends may be related to the product or service of a given business. The monitored information may be plotted on trend charts reporting the periodic results for example. The periodic information is averaged to provide a baseline frequency of occurrence of particular terms in some embodiments. Peaks and valleys in the chart may indicate time periods that need further investigation for example.

In some embodiments content analyzer may be implemented on client device . In some embodiments the client device receives the periodic traffic information that indicates particular time periods to analyze. In some embodiments the content analyzer retrieves content items for the particular time period and uses the same terms that were used to monitor the onsite and offsite traffic to filter the content items prior to retrieving it. The content analyzer may determine the frequency count of the terms in the content items and compare the results to a baseline frequency count of the same terms for example. The baseline may be determined by periodically e.g. daily hourly weekly retrieving content items and determining the frequency count of terms for example. In alternate embodiments the content analyzer receives two time periods to compare instead of comparing to a baseline. In some embodiments the time periods are determined by the traffic information received from the analytics server. In any of the embodiments described above the frequency count of the terms from the content items is compared to the baseline or alternate time period to determine the change in the frequency of occurrence of the term. This will be described in further detail below. This information may be displayed as described above in . In addition the content items may be filtered an analyzed as described above for example.

As an example a retail business may utilize an analytics server to routinely monitor the traffic at the retail website. The traffic information reported may include but is not limited to the number of views the links that were selected or how long each visitor remained on the website. The business may also monitor terms e.g. product name business name phrase corresponding to a brand identity in the content items provided by customers in the product review section. The business may also monitor three independent external to the business product review sites and a social media website with the same terms. The analytics server may provide a report or a graph showing the trends of the terms on an hourly or daily basis for example. In the report or graph a sudden spike may appear in the trend data after a relatively flat week. Based on the information from the report the content analyzer may receive the time period of the spike and the time period a week before the spike as the two time periods to compare. The content analyzer may retrieve the content items from the two time periods. Only the content with the terms that were monitored by the analytics service may be retrieved.

The frequency count of the terms in the content items from the two dates are determined and compared to determine the change in the frequency count of the terms. The terms are indexed to track the frequency count content item and content source of the term. The results may be graphically displayed such that font size of the term indicates the magnitude in the change of the frequency count. The color of the term in the display may indicate an increase or a decrease in the change of the frequency count. The initial results of the content items may show that sale is the term with the greatest change in the frequency count followed by the term great deals. Selecting the term sale further filters the content items to include content comprising the term sale . The filtered results may indicate that the terms great deals and jeans are the terms in the filtered content items with the greatest change in the frequency count. At any point the content source may be selected to review the actual content comprising the initial terms and sale . If the social media content source was selected the filtered content items may show conversations about the great deals on jeans . If the product review content source was selected there may not be a significant amount of content contributing to the terms sale great deals and jeans. It may be possible to conclude that the current sale is a success and generated the extra traffic.

In some embodiments data collector locates or retrieves content items from one or more content sources. For example the data collector may retrieve content items from a website such as a social media website via an API e.g. application programming interface . In some embodiments the API allows data collector to retrieve particular content items e.g. comments on retail or news sites for a given topic or social media content for a particular demographic or retrieve all content items for a given time period. As an example to retrieve particular content items the data collector may retrieve content comprising particular terms e.g. product name brand identity phrases etc. . On other websites for example the content may be an article posted during the given time period that is retrieved in its entirety.

In some embodiments data collector retrieves content items from one or more content sources for given time periods. For example data collector may retrieve content from two separate time periods for comparison. In some embodiments data collector retrieves content from time periods preceding or following the selected two time periods in preparation for user request to change the time period. In alternate embodiments data collector retrieves content items from one or more content sources on a periodic basis to build a baseline for comparison to any selected time period. In other embodiments data collector retrieves one or more time periods to compare a single time period to multiple time periods where the multiple time periods are analyzed to determine an average. For example this embodiment may be used to compare a given day to the average over a week prior to the given day.

In some embodiments frequency counter is configured to count the terms in the plurality of content items retrieved by data collector . In some embodiments the frequency count of terms such as the and a and punctuation is not determined. This may avoid separately indexing two terms that are differentiated only by punctuation for example e.g. sale and sale . In some embodiments the frequency counter determines the frequency count of the terms for the plurality content items from each of the plurality of content sources e.g. content source in .

In alternate embodiments frequency counter is also configured to index and count the terms in the plurality of content items. Indexing the terms includes parsing the terms from the plurality of content items and maintaining information corresponding to the index terms. The information corresponding to the indexed terms may include the frequency count for each of the plurality of indexed terms the content item and the content source for the term.

In some embodiments report generator filters and or organizes the counted terms and or indexed and counted terms from frequency counter . The report generator may be configured to organize and or analyze the counted terms from each of a plurality of content items for example. In addition in some embodiments report generator filters the counted terms when additional terms are selected in UI component . In some embodiments report generator determines the change in the frequency count of terms between two particular time periods. The particular time periods may be a specific date or an average over time as described above for example.

In some embodiments UI component is configured to display the results determined by frequency counter and report generator . In some embodiments UI component displays the traffic information received from an analytics server e.g. analytics server in . From the traffic information time periods of interest may be determined and selected for example. In some embodiments selecting the time period of interest causes data collector to retrieve content items from the selected time period of interest. In alternate embodiments a baseline time period of interest is selected for comparison to a given time period. In addition in some embodiments UI component displays the results of frequency counting and provides selectable terms. Selecting a term further filters the content items and the frequency counted terms in some embodiments. In some embodiments UI component is configured to present individual selections e.g. a link or button to click or select for each content source contributing to the report. Selecting the content source may provide a plurality of filtered content for example e.g. filtered with selectable indexed terms . As described above indexing terms includes tracking the frequency count and content source associated with each of the plurality of terms.

For example a researcher may be interested in content associated with a recent news event. e.g. sporting event natural disaster IPO for tech startups etc The researcher may determine search terms and a particular time period to search within ten separate content sources for example. The data collector in the content analyzer may retrieve the plurality of content items comprising the search terms from the ten content sources. The content indexer and frequency counter may determine the terms within the content items and determine the frequency count of the terms. The report generator may organize the indexed terms for display on the UI component. Terms with the greatest frequency count may be graphically indicated e.g. font size color order list bar graph etc. If a selected term is received the report generator may filter the content items with the selected term and re display the report on the UI component. After filtering the content items with the selected and or indexed terms the researcher may select one of the ten content sources to view the filtered plurality of content items corresponding to the selected content source.

As another example a small business owner may monitor their page views on the business website and the business revenue on a periodic basis via an analytics server. The most recent report from the analytics server may indicate a sharp decrease in revenue and a decline in page views. To determine the reason for the decline the business may use a content analyzer to retrieve a plurality of content items e.g. customer feedback from the retailers that sell their product for the time period corresponding to the most recent report. The data collector in the content analyzer may submit the retrieved plurality of content items to the frequency counter. The frequency counter may count and index the terms within the plurality of content items. In addition the data collector may retrieve content items from the same content sources for another time period that is representative of the average revenue and page views as expected for the business. The terms from these content items may be counted for the second time period to establish a baseline for comparison. The two groups of terms may be compared in the report generator and submitted to the UI component for display. One or more terms may be selected to filter the content to a manageable level for review. Each time a term is selected the content items are filtered with the selected term and the terms from the filtered content items are re displayed on the UI component. One of the content sources may be selected the index consulted and the filtered content items for the selected source displayed on the UI component. In the filtered content items e.g. filtered with the selected term the business may determine that there is an issue with the product there is an error on the retail website or that another better product is on the market for example.

As indicated in in some embodiments a plurality of content items are retrieved. In some embodiments the plurality of content items retrieved are for a given time period e.g. a particular date or range of dates . In some embodiments the plurality of content items may be retrieved on a periodic basis e.g. weekly daily etc. . In some embodiments the plurality of content items retrieved includes particular terms e.g. product or business names. The plurality of content items may be retrieved from one or more content sources for example. In some embodiments the plurality of content items are retrieved via an API configured to access particular content sources such as social media websites or retail websites. For example these content sources may track and sell the large amount of user content and associated data received at their individual website. In other embodiments all of the content items in the content source for a given time period is retrieved and locally parsed to determine the content items of interest. In some embodiments the retrieved content items is narrowed to content items comprising terms of interest e.g. product name topic etc. for a given time period.

As indicated in in some embodiments the frequency count for each of a plurality of terms within the plurality of content items for a specified time period is determined. In some embodiments the terms from the retrieved plurality of content items are determined. The retrieved plurality of content items may have non contributing terms e.g. stop words such as the removed for example. In addition in some embodiments phrases may be included in the terms e.g. product names business brands . Punctuation may be removed to avoid analyzing terms such as sale and sale separately for example. The frequency count may be determined for the specified time period. The specified time period may be a particular date or a range of dates for example. The time periods may be determined from information such as website traffic information provided by other sources e.g. from analytics server in In addition in other embodiments the frequency count for each of a plurality of terms within the plurality of content items is determined over multiple time periods in order to establish a baseline or average over time.

As indicated in in some embodiments the changes in the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms relative to a respective baseline frequency count for the respective one of the plurality of terms is identified. As discussed above in there are several embodiments for determining the changes in the frequency count. The changes in the frequency count may be determined by comparing the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms between to given time periods e.g. dates . One of the dates of comparison may be considered the baseline or normal activity for example. In other embodiments a baseline is pre determined by analyzing the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms over a given time period. The given time period may be a week a running average over a week a month or any other time frame of interest. In other embodiments website traffic information determines the time periods of interest. The trends in the website traffic information may determine a baseline time period for comparison to a time period comprising a peak a valley or a statistical deviation from the average for example.

As indicated in in some embodiments a report representing the changes in the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms is generated. The report may display the terms with a color scheme indicating the direction of the change in the frequency count and the font size indicating the magnitude of the change in the frequency count for example. In some embodiments selecting a particular term filters the plurality of content items and the corresponding terms from the filtered plurality of content items. The terms from the filtered content items may be re displayed for example. Another term may be selected or a particular content source e.g. content source in may be selected for example. In some embodiments selecting a particular content source accesses the content index and displays the actual filtered content items associated with the selected terms. At each step in the filtering the quantity of the plurality of content items contributing to the report may be displayed for example. Examples of the report will be discussed in detail in .

As indicated in in some embodiments the change in frequency count for one or more of the plurality of terms within the plurality of content items for the specified one or more time periods are displayed. As discussed above the specified time period may be one or more particular time periods e.g. particular dates hourly weekly or a range of time periods. At least one of the particular dates or range of dates may represent a baseline for example. In some embodiments the display indicates the magnitude of the change in the frequency count through font size and the direction of the change through a color scheme. However alternate embodiments may differentiate the data with other methods e.g. word clouds bar graphs etc .

As indicated in in some embodiments a selection of one of the plurality of terms is received e.g. from UI component in . The selected term may be selected because of indications that the term experienced a large increase in the frequency count for example. The selected term may be selected because of indications that the term is new to the plurality of content items for example. The selected term filters the content items as indicated in . In some embodiments each time a term is selected the plurality of content items are filtered with the selected term. As indicated in in some embodiments the filtered content items are re displayed to display only the changes in frequency count of terms from the filtered plurality of content items.

As depicted in a report of pages views for a business BlueSkies Travel has been generated. The data for the report may be determined by an analytics server e.g. analytics server in configured to monitor page views . A marketer for example may be interested in determining from content available from content sources e.g. content source in what may be contributing to the distinct change between the pages views on 8 13 and the pages views on 8 16 . The marketer may select those dates and select the Analyze feature.

As depicted in a report displaying the change in the frequency of occurrence in terms between the time period of 8 13 and 8 16 for BlueSkies Travel . Selecting the Analyze feature on the initial report display e.g. causes the data collector e.g. data collector in in content analyzer e.g. content analyzer in to retrieve content items e.g. from dates 8 13 and 8 16 from one or more content sources e.g. content sources in . The terms in the content items may be counted e.g. frequency counter . The font size indicates the magnitude of the change in frequency count of the indexed terms. For example sale has the greatest change in the frequency count followed by today as indicated by the font size. In some embodiments a color scheme may be used to indicate the direction of the change in the frequency count for each of the plurality of terms. In the lower right corner of the display the quantity of content items for each selected date is displayed. The first number 566 corresponds to the valley in the data for 8 13 in the report of . The second number 1093 corresponds to the peak in the data for 8 16 in the report of .

As depicted in C a term has been selected and the content items have been filtered to re display the terms from the filtered content items. The display e.g. user interface component in shows the terms for the content items filtered with the terms BlueSkies Travel and today for the selected dates 8 13 and 8 16 . Sale is still the term with the greatest magnitude of change in the frequency of occurrence. Other terms such as online exclusively exclusive book and travel are prevalent in the content items but a little less than sale as indicated by the font size. It should also be noted that phrases such as world traveler and travel deal are included in the terms. As described above non contributing words such as the are not analyzed. As described in the lower right corner of the display shows the quantity of content utilized for the display. In this example the number 5 is the quantity of content items for the 8 13 date and 170 is the quantity of content items for the 8 16 date. With the content items filtered to a reasonable amount to view the content source may be selected instead of selecting another term such as sale to filter the content items further. Selecting the content source will display the actual filtered content items retrieved from content sources. It should be noted that although a single content source is depicted in more than one content source may be included in the report.

As depicted in the actual filtered content items for the terms displayed in is displayed. The left column displays the five filtered content items for the 8 13 date e.g. 5 170 in . The right column displays the one hundred and seventy filtered content items for the 8 16 date e.g. 5 170 in . As indicated by the bold text the terms used for filtering the content items are present in each individual content e.g. BlueSkies Travel today .
