This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional app. Ser. No. 61 699 161 filed Sep. 10 2012 entitled ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS AND METHODS which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Objects e.g. photos videos documents files group of codes etc. in a data processing system are often designed for more than one user to access. Typically access to objects is controlled by an access control list ACL . The ACL identifies the users and types of access given to an object. To allow different users to access the object the ACL that controls access to the object needs to be changed accordingly. For example if Charlie does not have access to an object e.g. an image and needs to be given access to the object the ACL that controls access to the object needs to be changed to include Charlie.

If a single access involves accessing two or more objects ACLs that control access to these objects need to be changed to reflect the correct access permissions. For example if a photo object e.g. an image is embedded or attached to an email or a document a webpage etc. the ACLs that control access to both the photo object and the email need to be changed to reflect that those users who have access to the email far also given access to the photo.

The subject matter discussed herein relates generally to data processing and more particularly to access control systems and methods. The subject matter discussed herein may provide advantages. For example access control information is context sensitive based on the wish or intent of the user granting access. Access control information does not need to be changed and or managed for multiple combinations of access permissions. Access control information may be implemented as a central system or distributed systems.

The subject matter includes a method for receiving a request from a user to access a first object where first access control information is associated with the first object determining that the first object is referenced by a second object determining second access control information associated with the second object where the second access control information identifies the user as having access to the second object and providing to the user access to the first object based on to the second access control information.

In some implementations the first access control information is stored in a first access control object associated with the first object the second access control information is stored in a second access control object associated with the second object and a third access control object may be created that includes the first access control information and the second access control information.

In some implementations the first access control information is stored in an access control object associated with the first object and the access control object may be modified to include the second access control information associated with the second object.

In some implementations the first access control information does not identify the user as having access to the first object.

In some implementations the second access control information is contained in two or more access control lists formed in a linked list and the user having access to the second object is found traversing through the access control lists.

In some implementations there may be two or more versions of an object and two or more versions of the associated access control information. The correct access control information is determined based on the version of the associated object. In some situations the correct access control information is the last version of access control information.

In some implementations the second object identifies or references the first object e.g. by embedding or providing a link to the first object . The first object may be an image a video a document an audio an email message a file or the like.

In addition to a method as described above the implementations may include a system or a computer readable medium but are not limited thereto.

The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing access control systems and methods.

Controlling access to objects e.g. photos videos emails documents files group of codes web postings etc. may be allowed and or restricted based on context. For example a user Bob may own or have the authority to grand access to an image and a post on a social network that shares the images. As an illustration Bob wants to share an image on a social network. At the moment of sharing one or more of the users with whom e.g. the recipients Bob wants to share the image may not have access to the images. For example access to the image may be controlled using access control information e.g. an access control list or ACL which indicates who is allowed to access the image and Bob has not granted access to these users in the ACL . The access control information may not allow every user in Bob s recipient list to access the image.

Bob may share the image by creating a post in which Bob embeds or attaches the image or includes a link to the image e.g. the image is referred to or referenced by the post . Access to the post and content of the post e.g. including the image may be controlled based on the recipients of the post e.g. access is given to the recipients of the post . For example since Bob creates the post Bob may be considered as the owner of the post or given the authority to control access to the post e.g. in an ACL associated with the post .

Based on the context of the post access to the image may be automatically granted to the recipients of the post regardless of and in some implementations without changing the access control information that controls access to the image. In this example Bob includes Alice as a recipient of the post which is used to share the image. This context shows that Bob has intended for Alice to have access to the image. Therefore regardless of whether Alice has access to the image based on the access control information e.g. an ACL associated with the image Alice as a recipient of the post is allowed to access to all the content of the post including the image. Bob does not have to change the ACL associated with the images to grant Alice access to the image via the post.

Post object may be a post created by a user e.g. Bob . For example Bob wants to share image with users such as those on an email network or a social network. Bob may create post to share that image . Post may include the author e.g. Bob . Bob may provide information of one or more recipients additional information such as a title or subject line and a message . Recipients may be identified in any manner such as using email addresses and or user identifiers e.g. users in Bob s Kindergarten Parents circle and another user Alice . Recipients identifies the recipients Bob wants to share post with. To share image in post Bob may embed or attach image to post e.g. post references image or the content of post includes or identifies image . Image shared in post is shown as image .

When Bob creates post ACL object may be created e.g. automatically created based on recipients . ACL object controls access to post . For example ACL object includes information that indicates a user Alice and a circle Kindergarten Parents e.g. users in that circle are allowed access to post .

The image that is being shared in post e.g. as an image or a link may have an associated ACL e.g. ACL object . For example ACL object may indicates that Bob s Family circle of users are allowed access to image .

Although ACL object does not indicate that user Alice or users in circle Kindergarten Parents are allowed access to image in the context of post access to image as image or link within post may be derived from one or more ACLs e.g. ACL object associated with post .

In the context of post image as image or link within post may have an effective ACL . Effective ACL may include the access control information e.g. ACL object associated with post and the access control information e.g. ACL object associated with image . In this example effective ACL is a union of ACLs and .

In some implementations effective ACL may be formed differently such as formed with access control information that is an intersection of two or more ACLs e.g. effective ACL allows access by users included in both ACLs object and . Other ways of forming effective ACLs may be using any combination of operators e.g. set operators in mathematics .

Effective ACL may be referred to as a context sensitive ACL. Effective ACL may be associated with any object or any type of object e.g. a post audio video image document text webpage etc. . In the example of effective ACL is associated with an image image .

Effective ACL may be conceptual e.g. not as an ACL object . For example when a user accesses image or link through post ACL object and ACL object may be consulted to determine whether the access is allowed e.g. whether the accessing user is included in the ACL object or ACL object .

In some implementations effective ACL may be created as an ACL object separate from ACL object and ACL object . When a user accesses image or link through post ACL object may be consulted to determine whether the access is allowed e.g. whether the accessing user is included in ACL object .

Is some implementations the content of ACL object or ACL object may be replaced by the content shown in effective ACL . When a user accesses image or link through post ACL object after its content replaced may be consulted to determine whether the access is allowed e.g. whether the accessing user is included in ACL object .

ACL objects e.g. ACL object ACL object ACL object etc. including any effective ACLs may be stored separately from the objects they are associated with e.g. post image etc. . In some implementations ACL objects maybe stored in a centralized system. In other example implementations ACL objects may be distributed to different parts of one or more data processing systems.

As used herein the term object refers to any collection of electronic content e.g. data codes and or other content the access of which can be or is desired to be controlled. Examples of objects may be but are not limited to a document image audio video a file a directory a database a communication session a communication line a group of codes or scripts an object as referred to in any object oriented programming language e.g. Java C etc. any part thereof or any combination thereof. An object can be any conceptual grouping of electronic content including one or more other objects one or more portions of one or more other object or any combination of electronic content and other objects. An object can be any information or collection of information the access of which can be or desired to be controlled. For example an object may be the geographic data leased from company A information about the sales clerks and people who can see what they are doing at company B the people with webmaster permissions at company C users with the ability to hit the reset button on a virtual machine or any other arbitrary information or data. Access control information may be stored in objects e.g. ACL objects .

As used herein the term account or online account refers to a product service or application associated with a user. A user may have subscribe to and or use one or more accounts or online accounts e.g. a user may have an email account a social network account a photo sharing account a video sharing account an online storage account a mobile account a blog account etc. .

An account can be an internet or external account e.g. an end user subscribing to an openly publicly or semi publicly available service an intranet or internal account e.g. an employee subscribing to a service of a company or firm an extranet or controlled availability account e.g. an account available to vendors customers or other controlled subscribers or another type of account.

As used herein the term product or service or application refers to any information data communication infrastructure organization service assistance entertainment or the like provided by one or more providers via online communication to at least one user. Examples of products services or applications may include but are not limited to online searching e commerce services maps locational data dating services online forums online platforms bulletin boards social networks websites sites chat rooms email communication image or photo sharing sites video sharing sites audio sharing sites data sharing platforms data storage software tax preparation and filing gaming mobile applications news translation toolbar calendar instant messaging short message service voice phone video communication service and the like. Products services or applications may be provided on any platform or device ranging from a mobile device e.g. smartphone to a semi mobile device e.g. a laptop and to a non mobile device e.g. a kiosk television computer etc. . A product service or application may communicate to a provider or another product service or application using a wired or wireless connection.

As used herein the term website or site refers to a set of web pages for providing or supporting related services. A website can be hosted on at least one computing device e.g. a system server web server application server client or any label accessible via a network or connection wired and or wireless . A website can be accessed and or supported using at least one top level Uniform Resource Locator URL e.g. abc.gov 123.org zxc.com bestads.com virtualbank.com and the like . A website can be operated and or supported by one or more business entities. For example ZXC Corporation may operate the website zxc.com that includes web pages content and or services from zxc.bestads.com e.g. advertisement services provided by another firm and virtualbank.com zxc payment services e.g. financial services provided by a financial institution .

ACL objects may include ACL objects and e.g. where effective ACL is implemented as an ACL object . In some implementations one or more ACL objects may contain one or more ACLs such as user information e.g. Alice and or indirect user information e.g. Kindergarten Parents circle which in turn may contain user information and or other circles etc. . In some implementations one or more ACL objects may contain one or more pointers to ACLs e.g. ACLs . In some implementations one or more ACL objects may contain a combination of one or more ACLs and pointers to ACLs.

ACL may be actual ACLs and or effective ACLs e.g. effective ACL . An ACL may contain user information e.g. Alice indirect user information e.g. Kindergarten Parents circle which in turn may contain user information and or other circles etc. and or one or more pointers to other ACLs.

In the example shown in objects and ACL objects may be implemented one to one e.g. for every unique object there exists a corresponding ACL object such that there are N objects to N ACL objects . The number of ACL objects to ACLs may be N to M and there may be K users. N M and K can be any numbers.

As examples object is associated with ACL object . Object may have an associated timestamp e.g. last modified timestamp or LTM that indicates when it was last modified or created. An ACL objects may include information for controlling different types of access such as read access R write update access W and owner or owner access O . Other types of access may be implemented. Here ACL object is implemented with O R and W access types. R of ACL object is illustrated with a pointer or link to ACL which includes information e.g. identifier of user and a pointer or link to ACL . ACL includes information of user and a pointer or link to ACL which includes information of user . In effects users and have read access to object .

Both W and O of ACL object point to ACL which includes information of users and . Users and have write update access as well as owner access to object .

In some implementations an ACL may be implemented with version control. ACL is shown with three versions. At time T version ACL contains information of user . Version at time T contains information of user . Version at time T the current or last version shown contains information of user and a pointer or link to ACL .

In some implementations an object may be implemented with version control. Object is shown with two versions with LMTand with LMT. One version e.g. is newer than the other version e.g. . Object is shown associated with ACL object .

In some implementations an ACL object may be implemented with version control. For example ACL object is shown being versioned. ACL object may be created initially at time t. Content of ACL object may be changed at time t t . . . and at time tn. At time tn the R access of ACL object may point to ACL . At other times on the LTM vector or time line the R W and or O access of ACL object may be different then what is shown at time tn.

In some implementations the timestamp e.g. last modified timestamp or LMT of an ACL or the associated object may be used as a version indicator of the associated object contents as well as the object ACLs. For example at time T not shown Alice shares post P with her Friends circle and Bob is not in Alice s Friends circle and is not receiving P as a separate user. Version 1 of P P.v1 and the associated ACL object ACL.v1 may be created based on the LMT of the P at T. Alice then updates post P at time T not shown e.g. adding something Alice believes Bob may want to see and adds Bob to her Friends circle or as a user in addition to the Friends circle who is allowed to access post P. Version 2 of P P.v2 and the associated ACL object ACL.v2 which includes Bob may be created based on the LMT of the P at T. Alice s intent is to use ACL.v1 with P.v1 and use ACL.v2 with P.v2.

In some implementations an ACL object may be create for each combination of object version and ACL version. In some implementations as in the example of ACL object an ACL object may point to correct version of the ACL such as the latest version or a correct version as shown in .

The video sharing site may create an ACL object for controlling access to video object e.g. ACL object is associated with video object . ACL object include information for one or more access types e.g. Own Comment and Read . A link from access type Own to ACL indicates that Alice has owner access privilege. In some implementations users with read or view access may be allowed to provide comments as shown with the arrow pointing from Comment to Read access . The Read access type includes a pointer to ACL which indicates that a Family circle of users are allowed to read or view video object .

Note that ACL object which is associated with video object and used to control access to video object does not allowed access to Alice s Friends circle. To implement Alice s wish or intent which is allowing users who can view or read webpage object e.g. those in the Friends circle to also view or read video shared in webpage object an effective ACL may be implemented. One example implementation of an effective ACL is adding a link from the video s Read access ACL to the post s Read access type which is linked to Alice s Family circle in ACL . With a path from the video s Read access type to Alice s Friends circle members of Alice s Friends circle are allowed access to video object .

In some implementations ACL object may be changed to include link e.g. changing ACL which is part of ACL object to include link . In some implementations link may be recorded e.g. in a link table without changing ACL object or ACL . Anytime an ACL e.g. ACL is consulted the link table is check to see if any link from the ACL exists. If it does the link is followed.

Another example of an effective ACL may be creating an ACL object not shown that includes the union of the ACL objects and but is separate and in addition to ACL objects and . For example the Effective ACL object would look the same as ACL object with a link to add from ACL to ACL .

When a member of Alice s Friends circle e.g. Bob attempts to access e.g. view video object through webpage object ACL object is checked to see if Bob is allowed to access the webpage object which he is. When Bob attempts to view video object ACL object is checked and determines that as a results of link Bob is allowed to view e.g. read the video as intended by Alice.

At block it is identified or determined that a second object is associated with the first object. The second object may be for example an email a webpage or a post on a social network. The second object may share or reference the first object e.g. the first object being presented provided contained embedded or included as a link . At block a second access control information is determined associated with the second object. The second access control information may be an ACL and or contained in an ACL object. The second access control information identifies one or more users who are allowed access to the second object. At block access to the first object is provided according to or based on the second access control information.

For example if the one or more users in the second access control information include the user making the access request the user is allowed to access the first object. If the one or more users in the second access control information do not include the user making the access request the user is not allowed to access the first object. If the user is denied access to the first object an error message reason for the denial and or status code may be returned or provided.

In some examples process may be implemented with different fewer or more blocks. Process may be implemented as computer executable instructions which can be stored on a medium loaded onto one or more processors of one or more computing devices and executed as a computer implemented method.

An example of one or more devices may be computing device described below in . Devices may include but are not limited to a computer e.g. a laptop computing device a mobile device e.g. smartphone or tablet a television with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto a device associated with a vehicle a server computer computing devices storage devices and .

In some implementations devices may be considered user devices e.g. devices used by users to access services and or issue requests such as on a social network . Devices may be devices associated with service providers e.g. used by service providers to provide services and or store data such as webpages text text portions images image portions audios audio segments videos video segments and or information thereabout .

For example a user e.g. Alice may access view and or share a video embedded in a webpage using user device or on a social network supported by one or more devices . A recipient e.g. Bob may access and or view Alice s shared content using device or .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled to input user interface and output device interface . Either one or both of input user interface and output device interface can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input user interface may include any device component sensor or interface physical or virtual that can be used to provide input e.g. buttons touch screen interface keyboard a pointing cursor control microphone camera braille motion sensor optical reader and or the like . Output device interface may include a display television monitor printer speaker braille or the like. In some example implementations input user interface and output device interface can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device . In other example implementations other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input user interface and output device interface for a computing device .

Examples of computing device may include but are not limited to highly mobile devices e.g. smartphones devices in vehicles and other machines devices carried by humans and animals and the like mobile devices e.g. tablets notebooks laptops personal computers portable televisions radios and the like and devices not designed for mobility e.g. desktop computers other computers information kiosks televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto radios and the like .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled e.g. via I O interface to external storage and network for communicating with any number of networked components devices and systems including one or more computing devices of the same or different configuration. Computing device or any connected computing device can be functioning as providing services of or referred to as a server client thin server general machine special purpose machine or another label.

I O interface can include but is not limited to wired and or wireless interfaces using any communication or I O protocols or standards e.g. Ethernet 802.11x Universal System Bus WiMax modem a cellular network protocol and the like for communicating information to and or from at least all the connected components devices and network in computing environment . Network can be any network or combination of networks e.g. the Internet local area network wide area network a telephonic network a cellular network satellite network and the like .

Computing device can use and or communicate using computer usable or computer readable media including transitory media and non transitory media. Transitory media include transmission media e.g. metal cables fiber optics signals carrier waves and the like. Non transitory media include magnetic media e.g. disks and tapes optical media e.g. CD ROM digital video disks Blu ray disks solid state media e.g. RAM ROM flash memory solid state storage and other non volatile storage or memory.

Computing device can be used to implement techniques methods applications processes or computer executable instructions in some example computing environments. Computer executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media and stored on and retrieved from non transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more of any programming scripting and machine languages e.g. C C C Java Visual Basic Python Perl JavaScript and others .

Processor s can execute under any operating system OS not shown in a native or virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit application programming interface API unit input unit output unit ACL objects management unit ACL management unit access management unit and inter unit communication mechanism for the different units to communicate with each other with the OS and with other applications not shown . For example ACL objects management unit ACL management unit and access management unit may implement one or more processes shown in . The described units and elements can be varied in design function configuration or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some example implementations when information or an execution instruction is received by API unit it may be communicated to one or more other units e.g. logic unit input unit output unit ACL objects management unit ACL management unit and access management unit . For example input unit receives a video and via API unit communicates with ACL objects management unit to create an ACL object for the video. ACL objects management unit interacts with ACL management unit to create one or more ACLs for use with the newly created ACL object for the controlling access to the video. When an access to the video is received e.g. by input unit the access requests may be passed to access management unit to determine using one or more associated ACL objects whether access to the video is granted.

In some instances logic unit may be configured to control the information flow among the units and direct the services provided by API unit input unit output unit ACL objects management unit ACL management unit and access management unit in some example implementations described above. For example the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be controlled by logic unit alone or in conjunction with API unit .

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
