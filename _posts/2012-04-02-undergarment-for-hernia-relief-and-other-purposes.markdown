title: Undergarment for hernia relief and other purposes
abstract: A brief style elastic undergarment designed for the particular needs of a portly person having an enlarged abdomen. The undergarment is constructed of elastic spandex material and has a high cut back and a low cut front so the waistband traverses the torso passing across the small of the back thence under the abdomen. The undergarment further comprising an auxiliary elastic waistband specifically intended to hold abdominal hernias in, and an attached supporting undershirt. Thus the elastic in the briefs and the auxiliary band press small hernias back into the abdominal cavity. For use by males, there is a hole through which the penis and scrotum project to avoid being compressed and allowing a snug, pressure fit across the front. The garment may be used as sleepwear and athletic wear.

This application is a continuation of patent application Ser. No. 12 322 648 titled Undergarment for Hernia Relief and Other Purposes filed Feb. 5 2009 now abandoned which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11 147 693 titled Garment for Enhancing Male Sexual Performance filed Jun. 8 2005 now abandoned which includes Provisional Application 60 580 115 titled Garment for Enhancing Male Sexual Performance filed Jun. 16 2004. All three described applications are incorporated herein by reference.

Spandex Spandex is the generic term for a polyurethane elastic filament. Lycra is Dupont s trade name for spandex filament. The term spandex is also applied to fabrics having elastic properties provided by spandex or similar elastic fiber. A review of textile manufactures wholesalers and swimsuit manufactures revealed that the spandex filament content of swimsuit fabrics ranges from 10 to 36 percent with the most common being in the range of 15 20 .

This document intends that elastic fiber of other composition such as plastics natural rubber synthetic rubber etc when woven into a fabric be included in the definition of spandex fabric .

Four way stretch fabric has elastic fiber in both the woof and warp axes thus it has spandex fiber provided elasticity along two orthogonal axes. Two way stretch fabric has elastic fiber in only one axis thus exhibits spandex fiber provided elasticity along only one axis.

Elasticity Elasticity by common usage and this disclosure is imparted by actual elongation and restoration of fibers having rubber like elastic properties. This is inherent in elastic fibers such as spandex fiber and rubber strands which under tension are capable of elongation and returning to original length when the tension is released. Some spandex may be lengthened as much as 500 . When knit or woven into a fabric the fabric as a whole exhibits a rubber like expand ability and contraction accompanied by noticeably significant force.

Some fabrics exhibit stretch ability by virtue of the weave having convolutions which are distorted under tension. Notable examples are knits such as in sweaters and many knit cotton undergarments in which the fabric may be readily distorted. The stretching and restoration is not accompanied by significantly strong forces in comparison to spandex containing fabrics. For the purposes of this document these are not considered to be elastic fabrics. Thrower U.S. Pat. No. 5 875 495 FIG. 9 illustrates a typical stretchable but not elastic fabric weave.

Joining or attaching two or more fabric items by thread passing multiple times through the fabric pieces to be joined.

The 5 zones of the garment front or pubic back left and right sides and perineal coverings may be referred to as panels .

 Panels may refer to the zones or to individual separate pieces of fabric which are to be or are sewn together or to portions of fabric pieces covering more than one zone.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 416 272 by Nedwyn Nelkin teaches an hernia relief garment having some similarity to the present invention however it differs in important details. Nelkin has a brief type undergarment made of spandex and two belts as does the present invention. However the belts are not fastened to the brief in the same manner and place as the present invention is not designed for and will not fit a person with a pot belly as is the present invention. That is the waistband 18 of the garment does not ride between the small of the back and low under the belly pot . Thus the Nelkin waistband 18 is likely to ride down under the belly and cause the front panel to loosen bunch lose its elastic properties and purposes.

The Nelkin secondary band 4 is fastened to the garment at the front not the back as is the present invention. Thus vertical adjustment is limited to the back of the band whereas in the present invention the belly band and waistband are attached together at the back and it is the front portion of the belly band that is vertically adjustable as that is where abdominal hernias are likely to be present not at the back.

U.S. Pat. No. 2 684 673 by Samuel Lerman is a intended for use as a binder or support for surgical dressings under the binder. There is no elasticity anywhere. However there is a hole for admitting the wearer s penis and scrotum. The hole is pictured but not described as being an ovoid with the larger radius on the upper side. It is probable that the shape was not selected for function but to generally conform to the tapering of the binder width in the vicinity of the hole.

U.S. Pat. No. 1 263 756 by Alfred Linneros teaches a combination of a pair of non elastic shorts 6 with a hole 10 and a connected undershirt 5 .

The undershirt is buttoned at 4 points not sewn to the shorts. More specifically the buttons 9 are carried on the shorts and the cooperating button holes 8 are at the ends of shoulder straps 7 lines 35 40 . The phrasing at lines 35 36 and the dotted lines following the straps 7 over the shoulder in FIG. 1 suggest that the straps are sewn to the undershirt.

The buttoned shoulder straps are the only means to hold the shorts up no draw string no rubber bands elastic bands nor any other devices to keep them from slipping from the torso and there is no specific waistband terminating the upper end of the shorts. A selvedged edge or hemmed edge are not deemed to be a waistband.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 875 495 by John H. Thrower teaches an undergarment for men that has a hole for the receiving the penis and scrotum of the wearer.

Thrower s garment is intended primarily as an athletic supporter col 2 lines 27 29 2 27 29 . Thrower s hole is a symmetrical oval figures and 4 2 5 not ovoid egg shaped as in the present invention. Thrower s garment what he calls the tubular body portion is comprised of knit cotton. The only portion taught as comprising elastic fibers is the front covering 14 in some embodiments and the partial waist band 38 at the top of covering 14. The tubular portion is knit cotton which is stretchable due to the characteristics of the looping knitting of the fiber strands which permits the fabric to be stretched by distorting the knitted loops. The stretching force is minimal. The knitted cotton fabric panels have no spandex content.

Thrower does not teach that any of the knit cotton panels are elastic. Only front panel 14 is described as elastic. The knitted cotton portions are not considered as being elastic.

It is an object of the invention to provide stabilization and relief for small hernias in the abdominal and perineal regions.

It is another object of the invention to provide adjustment of the positioning of the hernia stabilization means.

It is another object of the invention to be usable and effective for a wearer having an enlarged abdomen a pot belly .

The present invention is comprised of four basic components which can be utilized in various combinations for use as an hernia support garment as long john type underwear as athletic wear and as sleepwear.

The four basic components are a brief style spandex undergarment with the back cut higher than the front an extra elastic band circling from the small of the back around the waist at near the navel in the front a tank type undershirt and a pair of knit hose extending to the ankle. The undershirt is sewn to the elastic briefs to prevent creeping of the undershirt the briefs and the extra band. The extra elastic band herein called the belly band provides gentle pressure on small abdominal hernias thereby pressing them back into the peritoneal sack. The briefs are also optionally attached to a pair of hose having stirrups under the feet. The preferred material for both the undershirt and hose is knit material having stretch ability deform ability but little or no elasticity force providing .

The elastic waist band of the briefs is differently placed compared to the band of ordinary under shorts. The back portion of the shorts is cut higher than the front so the waist band is on a slope extending around the small of the back thence downward and under the abdomen of the wearer. The optional elastic belly band is attached to the waist band at the back and extends approximately horizontally around the midriff and over or near the navel.

The brief style shorts portion of the undergarment is constructed of either two way or four way stretch elastic fabric such as spandex Lycra or similar fabrics used in swimwear and athletic wear. The shorts component is constructed of spandex fabric all around. Thus pressures applied by the spandex hold small hernias of the groin in place to avoid strangulation of the intestines.

To avoid squashing the penis and testes and to allow the front and perineum panels to snug against the body and provide more even pressures from the spandex fabric especially in the perineum the shorts are equipped with an egg shaped hole through which the penis and scrotum are passed.

The brief portion of the present invention is preferably constructed of elastic material such as is use in swim wear or athletic wear 10 36 spandex . The preferred fabric is four way spandex of 15 20 spandex in all 5 panels that is the front back left and right sides and crotch panels. However the crotch panel may be two way spandex oriented front to back.

Generally the brief is made by sewing the five panels together but two or more of the panels may be fashioned from a single continuous piece of spandex comprising two or more panels. The description panels then refers to the position and function of sections of the single swatch of fabric.

Because there is no need for providing room for the male external organs the pattern for cutting can be essentially the same as for women s swimwear with modifications to adapt to the male torso such as thicker waist male abdominal shapes etc. The pubic and perineal panels should fit snugly against the body. In conventional brief style underwear with the penis and scrotum being inside the garment the crotch panel cannot stretch snugly over the perineum surface nor can the pubic panel be snugged against the pubes.

An elastic waistband is sewn to the top terminus of the torso surrounding panels but unlike conventional briefs or even swimwear the waistband is not worn essentially horizontal but sloped downward from a high back fitted to pass over the small of the back and a low front passing under the abdomen. The primary function of the waistband is to anchor the briefs in one position especially in the presence of an enlarged abdomen. The high back low front cut places the brief s waistband in the natural position where there is no tendency to creep as is the case with ordinary straight across waistbands on conventional brief type underwear.

When the conventional brief type underwear waistband creeps down the front panel becomes loose and blouses. This is unacceptable in a spandex garment. It is essential for a spandex brief to keep the front panel flat and produce even pressure on the pubic area. While creeping and loosening is not a problem in conventional knit underwear utilizing pre crept waistband like the present waistband would improve conventional style underwear.

Referring to and the preferred characteristics of the waistband is for it to be made in a continuous unbroken loop of two way spandex sewn all around to the front back and side panels of the shorts. The dimensions are 1 to 3 inches wide and the back 2 to 5 inches higher 10 than the front so that the waistband fits into the small of the back and around the waist under the abdomen.

Alternatively the waistband may be formed by sewing a hem constructed of two or more layers the spandex panels folded over.

Another advantage of the high back under the abdomen waist band is that the position shown in is a smaller circumference than the ordinary more horizontal position approximately in the position of the belly band . In fact the high low position is the smallest circumference of any waist measurement of a portly person. This means that an elastic in position of will have less hoop tension than other positions of wearing and that the propensity of an elastic waist band or belt to slip down is greatly reduced as it is already slipped down .

The preferred penis scrotum hole is a vertically oriented ovoid egg shape with the upper arc having a radius of approximately inch and the lower arc having a radius of approximately inch. The vertical length of the preferred hole is approximately 2 to 3 inches with the variation being at the lower end of the hole. Like any garment the positioning and the specific size of the hole and other garment parts is fitted to match the body size of the wearer. In no case should the hole be so small or misplaced as to pinch the sides or top of the penis or to bind at the underside of the scrotum. A front covering is optional but valued when the garment is used as a hernia brace or as general underwear. The covering is made of knit cotton or any other material and weave suitable for the application. It is fastened to or near the lower edge of the waist band and to the perineal crotch panel. Covering is loose enough to form a pocket for the organs without significant binding. The fastening may be by any convenient method such as tack sewing buttons snaps ties Velcro etc and may include attachment along the sides of cover panel .

The second hernia relief element of the invention is an optional elastic belly band 2 to 4 inches wide. The belly band is spot sewn to the briefs portion of the invention basic garment waist band at the back by either of the methods shown in . illustrates preferred method of joining the belly band to the waistband being sewn edge to edge. A small overlap to facilitate machine stitching is deemed to be edge to edge. This preferred attachment allows the belly band to pivot at the back while the front is adjusted up and down.

The elastic belly band is generally placed over or near the navel and is adjusted to cover flatten and hold abdominal hernias.

Referring to the third part of the invention is the addition of a shirt portion in the general form of an undershirt.

The undershirt portion of the garment is of cotton knit or other suitable materials and weaves. The shoulder straps convey additional lift to the waist bands and lower abdominal portion especially if there is a hanging pouch of fat. Some spandex may be included in some locations for a conforming fit and support. The undershirt portion is sewn to the elastic waistband at least at the front half and preferably all around. The belly band is left unattached to the undershirt to be free for adjusting up or down. Among other things the attached undershirt prevents the waistband from folding which would result in pinching and binding. Obviously the undershirt s attachment to the brief portion also prevents the undershirt from creeping upward on the torso.

Upper band is omitted in some embodiments. The undershirt is cut lower under the arms than most tank top undershirts to give additional length to the shoulder straps so they may be more easily pulled over the shoulders. The top of the torso portion under the arms should end approximately 14 to 16 inches below the top of the shoulder. The front and back undershirt panels may be extended higher than shown in .

Referring again to the fourth part of the invention is the addition of a legging or hose portion in the general form of an long john type legwear sewn to the leg openings of the brief portion and extending to the ankle terminating in stirrup straps passing under the insteps of the feet.

The purpose of the hose portion is primarily for warmth when used as an undergarment in cold weather and as sleepwear.

The garment is pulled on over the buttocks and pelvis and the penis and scrotum is pulled through the hole and the belly band if used is adjusted to cover any abdominal hernias.

The brief design described as the basic garment shown in can be modified by adding short legs as shown in for both the preferred usage and the comfort sleep wear described below.

The garment can be modified for enhancing comfort while sleeping and in particular will provide a cooling effect on the testes during hot humid nights although the comfort feature is useful even on cool nights. For sleepwear and athletic wear slight modifications of the described invention is desired. The modifications are to have short legs as shown in and a covering panel made of cotton or similar absorbent fabric. This embodiment puts a layer of cloth between the penis and scrotum and the leg during sleeping. Thereby reducing sweating and absorbing whatever sweat does occur at the contact area. The fabric not only controls sweating but because of the contact area being dryer the growth of fungus and bacteria is inhibited or eliminated. The cooling effect should also be healthier for the testes which are sensitive to heat.
