Content items such as music movies television programming books etc. as well as performers have varying degrees of popularity. Additionally content items and performers have varying degrees of lasting value and or longevity. In other words certain content items and or performers may be popular for a very short period of time while others can achieve some degree of lasting value of timelessness where many generations of fans appreciate purchase and or consume a particular content item and or content items associated with a particular performer.

The present disclosure relates to determining and or predicting a lasting value of a content item and or performer based upon the demographics attributes of a population of users who express an interest in the content item and or performer. A system according to embodiments of the disclosure can determine and or make a prediction regarding whether a particular content item and or performer may have a lasting value. In the context of this disclosure a lasting value refers to whether a content item and or performer may achieve popularity relevance and or any other measure of success for an extended period of time. Therefore a content item and or performer having a great deal of lasting value may achieve popularity over longer periods of time relative to those that do not. For example a classic film may remain popular for years and or generations while a summer action film may only be popular for a short period of time.

In the context of the present disclosure a content item can represent a movie television show book music or any other media or portion thereof. Additionally a performer may represent an artist director singer songwriter actor producer or any other person or entity that can be associated with a content item as can be appreciated. Accordingly as will be described herein embodiments of the disclosure can calculate a metric associated with one or more content items as well as performers that represent a determination and or prediction of a lasting value of the content item and or performer.

With reference to shown is an example of a user interface that can be generated in an electronic commerce system information retrieval system or any other type of content delivery application. For example the user interface can be generated by a web application tasked with dynamic generation of web pages that can be transmitted via a network via a web server for rendering by a client device. The depicted example user interface includes information about a performer as well as potential content items. The depicted user interface is one example shown to illustrate one application of a content item metric and or performer metric that can be generated by various embodiments of the disclosure.

In this non limiting example the user interface can include a representation of a metric calculated by embodiments of the disclosure that represents the lasting value of the performer. As will be described herein the metric represents a longevity of the performer by analyzing the demographic makeup of a population of users who are fans of the performer.

Next a discussion of the networked environment is provided in which a content item metric and or performer metric can be calculated to determine a lasting value of a content item and or performer. With reference to shown is a networked environment according to various embodiments. The networked environment includes a computing environment a client device and or external resources which are in data communication with each other via a network . The network includes for example the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of two or more such networks.

The computing environment may comprise for example one or more server computers or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively the computing environment may employ a plurality of computing devices that may be employed that are arranged for example in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. Such computing devices may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For example the computing environment may include a plurality of computing devices that together may comprise a cloud computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. In some cases the computing environment may correspond to an elastic computing resource where the allotted capacity of processing network storage or other computing related resources may vary over time.

Various applications and or other functionality may be executed in the computing environment according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing environment . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various applications and or functional entities described below.

The components executed on the computing environment for example include a content analysis application and other applications services processes systems engines or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The content analysis application is executed to determine a content item metric and or performer metric that is based at least upon a distribution of a population of users associated with the content item and or performer according to a demographic attribute. In one embodiment the demographic attribute can be an age and or age range of users who are fans of a particular content item and or performer. Accordingly a particular content item may appeal to users who are spread across a wide range of a particular demographic attribute. Therefore such a content item may have more lasting value if it appeals to a more diverse population of users.

As an alternative example another content item may appeal to a very large number of users but these users may be largely concentrated within a particular age range. Accordingly such a content item may not have a particularly significant lasting value. Therefore as will be described herein a content item metric and or performer metric calculated by embodiments of the disclosure can calculate metrics that express whether an item is likely to have significant lasting value or appeal.

The data stored in the data store includes for example information about content items performers and users . The data store can include data for example that is associated with an electronic commerce system that supports one or more marketplaces in which users can purchase view stream download rent or otherwise consume content items and or information about content items or performers. For example a content item can be associated with a content file that can include but is not limited to an MPEG 1 Audio Layer III MP3 file representing an audio track an MPEG 4 audio file flash video fly file or any audio video or image format in which media can be stored and or transmitted to a client . A content item can comprise a single media file and or collection or album of media files that are associated with a single stock keeping unit or product identifier. Along with content items the data store can house item data about the various content items . Item data can comprise product descriptions performer information a title author album association genre or any other data by which a content item can be categorized.

Additionally each content item can be associated with a content item metric that is calculated by the content analysis application based upon demographics of a population of users associated with the content item . In other words users who are fans of a content item or that have otherwise expressed an interest in the content item are considered as being associated with the content item .

The data store can also include information about performers which can include artists authors musicians composers actors directors or any other performer that can be associated with one or more content items . Performer data can identify one or more content items with which a performer is associated as well as in what capacity. For example performer data can include an album discography of a musician by identifying the various content items with which the artist is associated. Similarly performer data can include an actor or director filmography by identifying the various content items with which he or she is associated. Additionally each performer can be associated with a performer metric that is calculated by the content analysis application based upon demographics of a population of users associated with the performer . In other words users who are fans of a performer or that have otherwise expressed an interest in the content item are considered as being associated with the performer .

The data store can also include information about users which can include user data . User data can store information about users of an electronic commerce system web site social networking system or any other type of system as can be appreciated. User data can include for example a user profile which can include demographic information about a user such as age location gender income music preferences movie preferences likes and dislikes shipping addresses telephone numbers payment information e mail addresses purchasing history product browsing history affinity groups with which the user is affiliated and other data related to users. User data can also include information about one or more third party sites or external resources with which the user is associated such as a social networking system. In one embodiment a user of the system can link one or more third party sites with an account of the user which can allow the content analysis application to access content associated with the user from the third party site such as the user s friends or linked users.

The data store can also store a user history associated with a user account. In one embodiment a user history can include a browse history of various content items performers and or content items or performers in which the user has indicated an interest. The user history can also indicate content items that the user has purchased rented downloaded and or streamed as well as a frequency with which the user may access a particular content item . The user history can be obtained from an electronic commerce system as a user navigates an electronic commerce site or other type of site in which content items or information about content items can be accessed. The user history can also be obtained from an application executed on a client device such as a media player application on a personal computer smartphone tablet device set top box etc.

The client is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer personal digital assistants cellular telephones smartphones set top boxes music players web pads tablet computer systems game consoles electronic book readers or other devices with like capability. The client may include a display . The display may comprise for example one or more devices such as liquid crystal display LCD displays gas plasma based flat panel displays organic light emitting diode OLED displays LCD projectors or other types of display devices etc.

The client may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application and or other applications. The client application may be executed in a client for example to access network content served up by the computing environment and or other servers thereby rendering a user interface on the display . To this end the client application may comprise for example a browser a dedicated application etc. and the user interface may correspond to a network page an application screen etc. The client may be configured to execute applications beyond the client application such as for example email applications social networking applications word processors spreadsheets and or other applications.

The external resources may comprise a plurality of external computing devices services network sites and or application programming interfaces API s used by the content analysis application . For example the content analysis application may communicate with a plurality of social networking sites in order to determine demographics preferences and or any information associated with one or more users through an API. For example the content analysis application may identify a given user s friends in a social networking system via such an API to analyze the content and or performer preferences of the user as well as the user s friends. As another example the content analysis application may also identify a user s preferences likes and or dislikes as expressed in a social networking system to determine whether the user should be accounted for when calculating a content item metric and or performer metric for a given content item or performer respectively.

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin embodiments of the disclosure can calculate a content item metric associated with a content item that provides an indication of the appeal of a content item . Additionally embodiments of the disclosure can also calculate a performer metric that provides an indication of the appeal of a performer . Accordingly both types of metrics are referred to generally herein as a metric or a lasting value. As noted above the metric can provide an indication about the longevity of the appeal of a particular performer and or content item . The metric can also provide an indication regarding whether a content item and or performer is likely to have a lasting value based upon demographic attributes of users expressing an interest in a particular content item and or performer .

In one embodiment the content analysis application can generate a metric based upon the distribution of a population of users associated with a content item and or performer according to a demographic attribute. For example the metric can be based upon the age distribution of a population of users who have a demonstrated interest in a particular content item and or performer. A demonstrated interest can be deduced by the content analysis application by determining whether a particular content item and or content associated with a particular performer is present within a purchase history of a user a download history a steaming history a rental history a search history or any other form of consumption history. A demonstrated interest can also be expressly indicated by a user . For example a user can expressly indicate that he or she is a fan of a particular content item and or performer in a social networking system an electronic commerce system in a user interface in a client application etc.

Therefore the content analysis application can identify a population of users across a base of users that exhibit such an interest in a particular content item and or performer and generate an age distribution of the users. The metric can then be based at least in part upon the shape of the age distribution or the extent to which the age of the users is distributed. For example if the age of the population of users is relatively concentrated in a handful of age brackets then the metric can reflect relatively little lasting value compared to a situation in which the age of the population of users is evenly spread across many age brackets.

In other words the content analysis application can generate a histogram so that the population of users having the demonstrated interest are placed into various bins corresponding to their age and or age range. Accordingly the flatter the shape of the histogram meaning the more evenly distributed the users are across the various bins the more lasting value that the content item and or performer possesses as the content item and or performer appeals to a more diverse age group of users . If the histogram has one or a few peaks the metric can reflect less of a lasting value as interest is concentrated into one or a few age brackets. In some embodiments the distribution of users can be normalized in various ways. In one example the content analysis application can normalize a particular bin based on the total number of users associated with the demographic attribute associated with the bin. In other words the bins of a histogram can be generated by the content analysis application according to a percentage of total users of a particular range associated with each of the bins who are associated with a particular content item and or performer.

Stated another way the content analysis application can calculate a metric associated with a lasting value of a content item and or performer by counting the number of bins in which a threshold number of users appear for a given content item and or performer. For example the content analysis application can identify bins in which a minimum number of users appear with respect to a given content item and or performer. Accordingly the greater the number of bins in which a threshold number of users appears relative to other content items or performers the more lasting value the content item and or performer possesses. In some embodiments a metric can be associated with a greater lasting value based upon the contiguousness of the bins in which users appear. In other words the more contiguous the shape of the histogram relative to histograms of other items or performers the more lasting value that can be associated with the content item and or performer.

Additionally the shape of such a histogram can be mathematically characterized to facilitate the generation of content item and or performer recommendations. For example a curve fit can be performed to identify a mathematical function that can characterize a curve that approximates the histogram. Accordingly the content analysis application can identify other content items and or performers that have a similarly shaped histogram relative to a particular item under analysis in order to generate recommendations of items that may have a similar lasting value.

In some embodiments the content analysis application can also limit the population of users upon which a metric is calculated. For example the content analysis application can calculate a metric by limiting candidates for the population of users demonstrating an interest in a particular content item or performer to those who are linked to a particular user within a social networking system. In this way the content analysis application can provide a metric that represents a determination of whether a particular content item and or performer has a lasting value among other users with whom a particular user may share interests. In other embodiments the content analysis application can also calculate a metric by determining a distribution user having an interest in a content item and or performer according to a different demographic attribute such as location income gender or other demographic attributes. In this way a metric generated by the content analysis application can express whether a particular content item and or performer appeals to a diverse set of users with respect to the demographic attribute s that are encompassed in the metric.

Referring next to shown is an example of a histogram that can be generated by the content analysis application and that represents a distribution of a population of users according to a demographic attribute e.g. age having an interest in a particular performer . It should be appreciated that the histogram can also represent a distribution of a population of users with respect to a particular content item as well. illustrates an example of a histogram associated with a performer from which a performer metric can be calculated that is associated with a high degree of lasting value because the fans of the performer span a large number of age brackets.

As noted above the distribution of users can also be normalized in various ways. For example the bins of the histogram representing a particular age range can represent a percentage of all users of that particular age range who have a demonstrated interest in the performer shown in the example of .

As also noted above a metric associated with a high degree of lasting value can be associated with a large number of bins in which users are placed relative to other histograms of other performers . It should be appreciated that in some embodiments various permutations and combination of age brackets that define the various bins of the histogram can be selected and that the depicted example is only one example. In contrast to the example of reference is now made to which illustrates an alternative example of a histogram that illustrates a data set from which a performer metric can be calculated. As shown in the example of the distribution of the population of users having a demonstrated interest in the performer differs from the example of .

In the depicted example the number of bins of the histogram in which a threshold number of users appears is less than the example of . Accordingly a performer metric that is based upon the number of bins of the histogram in which users appear would reflect that the performer shown in has less of a lasting value than in the case of . Additionally a performer metric that is based upon the contiguousness of the histogram would also reflect that the performer shown in has less of a lasting value than in the case of .

In contrast to the example of reference is now made to which illustrates an alternative example of a histogram that illustrates a data set from which a performer metric can be calculated. As shown in the example of the distribution of the population of users having a demonstrated interest in the performer differs from the example of . In contrast to the example of the histogram shown in illustrates an example where the number of bins as well as the contiguousness of the bins of the histogram are the same as in the case of . Accordingly a performer metric can also take into account the shape of the histogram. Therefore as shown in the example of the histogram possesses greater variation in bin sizes relative to the example of . Therefore a greater variation in relative bin size within a histogram can be associated with a metric that reflects less of a lasting value relative to less variation.
