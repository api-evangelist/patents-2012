title: Computer implemented methods and apparatus for providing internal custom feed items
abstract: Disclosed are systems, apparatus, and methods for presenting feed items in an information feed. In various implementations, a first result object is received, where the first result object is a data structure including a result of a feed query, where the result of the feed query includes at least one feed item to be included in the information feed, and where the at least one feed item has a first presentation. In various implementations, at least one custom object associated with the at least one feed item is received, where the at least one custom object provides a second presentation of the at least one feed item. In some implementations, the at least one custom object is included with the first result object to define an intermediary data structure. In some implementations, the intermediary data structure is stored on one or more storage mediums.

This application claims priority to co pending and commonly assigned U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 510 267 titled Systems and Methods for Providing Internal Custom Feed Items by Hanson filed on Jul. 21 2011 and co pending and commonly assigned U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 507 846 titled Systems and Methods for Implementing a Social Network Newsfeed as a Platform by Thaxton et al. filed on Jul. 14 2011 which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present application relates generally to providing on demand services in an online social network using a database system and more specifically to techniques for providing an information feed in the online social network.

 Cloud computing services provide shared resources software and information to computers and other devices upon request. In cloud computing environments software can be accessible over the Internet rather than installed locally on in house computer systems. Cloud computing typically involves over the Internet provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. Technological details can be abstracted from the users who no longer have need for expertise in or control over the technology infrastructure in the cloud that supports them.

Database resources can be provided in a cloud computing context. However using conventional database management techniques it is difficult to know about the activity of other users of a database system in the cloud or other network. For example the actions of a particular user such as a salesperson on a database resource may be important to the user s boss. The user can create a report about what the user has done and send it to the boss but such reports may be inefficient not timely and incomplete. Also it may be difficult to identify other users who might benefit from the information in the report.

Examples of systems apparatus and methods according to the disclosed implementations are described in this section. These examples are being provided solely to add context and aid in the understanding of the disclosed implementations. It will thus be apparent to one skilled in the art that implementations may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances certain process method operations also referred to herein as blocks have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring implementations. Other applications are possible such that the following examples should not be taken as definitive or limiting either in scope or setting.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings which form a part of the description and in which are shown by way of illustration specific implementations. Although these implementations are described in sufficient detail to enable one skilled in the art to practice the disclosed implementations it is understood that these examples are not limiting such that other implementations may be used and changes may be made without departing from their spirit and scope. For example the blocks of methods shown and described herein are not necessarily performed in the order indicated. It should also be understood that the methods may include more or fewer blocks than are indicated. In some implementations blocks described herein as separate blocks may be combined. Conversely what may be described herein as a single block may be implemented in multiple blocks.

Various implementations described or referenced herein are directed to different methods apparatus systems and computer program products for providing an information feed also referred to herein as a feed. In some online social networks users can access one or more information feeds which include information updates presented as feed items for instance in a graphical user interface GUI of a display device. The information updates can include various social network data from various sources and can be stored in an on demand database service environment. In some implementations the disclosed methods apparatus systems and computer program products may be configured or designed for use in a multi tenant database environment.

In some implementations an online social network may allow a user to follow data objects in the form of records such as cases accounts or opportunities in addition to following individual users and groups of users. One example of an online social network is Chatter provided by salesforce.com inc. of San Francisco Calif. Such online social networks can be implemented in various settings including organizations e.g. enterprises such as companies or business partnerships academic institutions or groups within such an organization. For instance Chatter can be used by employee users in a division of a business organization to share data communicate and collaborate with each other for various purposes.

The following of a record stored in a database as described in greater detail below allows a user to track the progress of that record. Updates to the record also referred to herein as changes to the record can occur and be noted on an information feed such as a record feed or a news feed of a user subscribed to the record. With the disclosed implementations such record updates are often presented as an item or entry in the feed. Such a feed item can include a single update or a collection of individual updates. Information updates presented as feed items in an information feed can include updates to a record as well as other types of updates such as user actions and events as described herein. Examples of record updates include field changes in the record as well as the creation of the record itself. Examples of other types of information updates which may or may not be linked with a particular record depending on the specific use of the information update include various types of messages. Examples of messages include posts such as explicit text or characters submitted by a user multimedia data sent between or among users for instance included in a post status updates such as updates to a user s status or updates to the status of a record uploaded files indications of a user s personal preferences such as likes and dislikes and links to other data or records. Information updates can also be group related e.g. a change to group status information for a group of which the user is one of several members. A user following e.g. subscribed to a record is capable of viewing record updates on the user s news feed which can also include the other various types of information updates described above. Any number of users can follow a record and thus view record updates in this fashion. Some records are publicly accessible such that any user can follow the record while other records are private for which appropriate security clearance permissions are a prerequisite to a user following the record.

Online social networks are increasingly becoming a common way to facilitate communication between individuals and groups of individuals any of whom can be recognized as users of a social networking system. In many social networks individuals may establish connections with one other sometimes referred to as friending one another. By establishing such a connection one user may be able to see information generated by or associated with another user. For instance a first user may be able to see information posted by a second user to the first user s personal social network page. One implementation of such a personal social network page is a user s profile page for example in the form of a web page representing the user s profile. For example a post submitted by the second user about the first user can be presented on the first user s profile feed also referred to herein as the user s wall which can be displayed on the first user s profile page.

In some implementations an information feed in the context of a social network may be a collection of information selected from the social network for presentation in a user interface. The information presented in the information feed may include posts to a user s wall or any other type of information accessible within the social network. A feed item can include various types of data including character based data audio data and or video data. For instance a post can include text in combination with a JPEG image or animated image. Feed items in information feeds such as a user s news feed may include messages which can take the form of posts comprising textual character based inputs such as words phrases statements questions emotional expressions and or symbols responses to posts also referred to herein as comments such as words phrases statements answers questions and reactionary emotional expressions indications of personal preferences which can be submitted as responses to posts or comments status updates and hyperlinks. In other examples messages can be in the form of file uploads such as presentations documents multimedia files and the like.

In some implementations a news feed may be specific to an individual user a group of users or a data object. For instance a group of users on a social network may publish a news feed. Members of the group and the larger social network may view and post to the group news feed in accordance with a permissions configuration for the news feed and the group.

In some implementations when data such as posts or comments input from one or more users are published to an information feed for a particular user group object or other construct within a social network an e mail notification or other type of notification may be transmitted to all users following the user group or object in addition to the posting of the published data as a feed item in one or more feeds such as a news feed or a record feed. In some social networks the occurrence of such a notification is limited to the first instance of a published input which may form part of a larger conversation. For instance a notification may be transmitted for an initial post but neither for comments on the post nor for follow up posts related to the initial post. In some other implementations notifications are transmitted for all such published inputs.

Some implementations of the disclosed systems apparatus and methods are configured to provide an information feed for instance to one or more users of an on demand service provided by a database service provider.

In various implementations a platform for generating an information feed may be provided. The platform may include a first interface such as a feed data layer that identifies and retrieves feed items to include in an information feed. In various implementations the feed data layer may include at least two separate components. A first component may handle queries of one or more database tables storing feed items. The second component may receive parameters from a user and pass the parameters to the first component. In various implementations the parameters may parameterize the query in order to determine which feed items are relevant to the information feed and should be included in the information feed. In various implementations the relevant feed items or their respective feed item IDs may be included in a result object. The separation of the feed data layer into two components may allow a database service provider to control and limit access to the type and number of database queries that may be performed on the database while allowing the user to parameterize queries. For example a user may be prevented from modifying the types of queries or frequency of queries performed by the first component. However the user may still pass parameters to the first component via the second component in order to parameterize the database queries. In various implementations providing this separation allows the database service provider to prevent redundant and excessive user generated queries that may burden database resources. Furthermore because the queries may be written by the database service provider for specific purposes the queries may be optimized for those purposes.

In some implementations the platform for generating an information feed may include a second interface such as a feed presentation layer that converts raw data included in the result object into a data object an intermediary data structure which may be rendered and displayed to a user. In various implementations the raw data included in the result object may include data such as identifiers used to identify a feed item. For example an identifier may be an object ID such as OID819. While the object ID may identify a relevant feed item more information may be needed in order to display the feed item to a user in a meaningful way because the user would not know what OID819 means. Thus contextual and formatting information may be identified and retrieved. Contextual information may provide additional information such as a full text sentence describing a change in attribute of a record as opposed to an object ID that simply points to a feed item associated with the record. Formatting information may provide a visual and spatial indication of how the information should be displayed in an information feed. Contextual and formatting information may be retrieved for each feed item of the result object and included with the result object to generate the intermediary data structure. In various implementations the intermediary data structure may include sufficient information to display the feed items identified by the result object in an information feed without additional database queries. Furthermore the intermediary data structure may be accessible and readable by multiple client applications. Thus multiple client applications may render and display the intermediary data structure without each having to run its own separate database query.

In various implementations a feed item handler interface may be provided that customizes feed items to be included in an information feed. In some implementations the feed item handler interface may customize feed items included in the result object by changing or modifying a presentation or functionality of the feed items. Accordingly a feed item handler interface may provide a first user with the ability to create a new feed item type. The feed item handler interface may receive an input identifying a new feed item type query data relevant to the new feed item type and combine the returned data with one or more feed items during the generation of the intermediary data structure. Once the new feed item type has been registered with the database service provider the new feed item type may be used by a second user. Thus the second user need not create a new feed item type but instead may access and use the new feed item type created by the first user.

These and other implementations may be embodied in various types of hardware software firmware and combinations thereof. For example some techniques disclosed herein may be implemented at least in part by computer readable media that include program instructions state information etc. for performing various services and operations described herein. Examples of program instructions include both machine code such as produced by a compiler and files containing higher level code that may be executed by a computing device such as a server or other data processing apparatus using an interpreter. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to magnetic media such as hard disks floppy disks and magnetic tape optical media such as CD ROM disks magneto optical media and hardware devices that are specially configured to store program instructions such as read only memory devices ROM and random access memory RAM devices. These and other features of the disclosed implementations will be described in more detail below with reference to the associated drawings.

The term multi tenant database system can refer to those systems in which various elements of hardware and software of a database system may be shared by one or more customers. For example a given application server may simultaneously process requests for a great number of customers and a given database table may store rows for a potentially much greater number of customers. The term query plan generally refers to one or more operations used to access information in a database system.

A user profile or user s profile is generally configured to store and maintain data about the user of the database system. The data can include general information such as title phone number a photo a biographical summary and a status e.g. text describing what the user is currently doing . As mentioned below the data can include messages created by other users. Where there are multiple tenants a user is typically associated with a particular tenant. For example a user could be a salesperson of a company which is a tenant of the database system that provides a database service.

The term record generally refers to a data entity such as an instance of a data object created by a user of the database service for example about a particular actual or potential business relationship or project. The data object can have a data structure defined by the database service a standard object or defined by a subscriber custom data structure . For example a record can be for a business partner or potential business partner e.g. a client vendor distributor etc. of the user and can include an entire company subsidiaries or contacts at the company. As another example a record can be a project that the user is working on such as an opportunity e.g. a possible sale with an existing partner or a project that the user is trying to get. In one implementation of a multi tenant database each record for the tenants has a unique identifier stored in a common table. A record has data fields that are defined by the structure of the object e.g. fields of certain data types and purposes . A record can also have custom fields defined by a user. A field can be another record or include links thereto thereby providing a parent child relationship between the records.

The terms information feed and feed are used interchangeably herein and generally refer to a combination e.g. a list of feed items or entries with various types of information and data. Such feed items can be stored and maintained in one or more database tables e.g. as rows in the table s that can be accessed to retrieve relevant information to be presented as part of a displayed feed. The term feed item or feed element refers to an item of information which can be presented in the feed such as a post submitted by a user. Feed items of information about a user can be presented in a user s profile feed of the database while feed items of information about a record can be presented in a record feed in the database by way of example. A profile feed and a record feed are examples of different information feeds. A second user following a first user or record can receive the feed items associated with the first user and the record for display in the second user s news feed which is another type of information feed. In some implementations the feed items from any number of followed users and records can be combined into a single information feed of a particular user.

As examples a feed item can be a message such as a user generated post of text data and a feed tracked update to a record or profile such as a change to a field of the record. A feed can be a combination of messages and feed tracked updates. Messages include text created by a user and may include other data as well. Examples of messages include posts user status updates and comments. Messages can be created for a user s profile or for a record. Posts can be created by various users potentially any user although some restrictions can be applied. As an example posts can be made to a wall section of a user s profile page which can include a number of recent posts or a section of a record that includes multiple posts. The posts can be organized in chronological order when displayed in a graphical user interface GUI for instance on the user s profile page as part of the user s profile feed. In contrast to a post a user status update changes a status of a user and can be made by that user or an administrator. Other similar sections of a user s profile can also include an About section. A record can also have a status the update of which can be provided by an owner of the record or other users having suitable write access permissions to the record. The owner can be a single user multiple users or a group. In one implementation there is only one status for a record.

In one implementation a comment can be made on any feed item. In another implementation comments are organized as a list explicitly tied to a particular feed tracked update post or status update. In this implementation comments may not be listed in the first layer in a hierarchal sense of feed items but listed as a second layer branching from a particular first layer feed item.

A feed tracked update also referred to herein as a feed update is one type of information update and generally refers to data representing an event. A feed tracked update can include text generated by the database system in response to the event to be provided as one or more feed items for possible inclusion in one or more feeds. In one implementation the data can initially be stored and then the database system can later use the data to create text for describing the event. Both the data and or the text can be a feed tracked update as used herein. In various implementations an event can be an update of a record and or can be triggered by a specific action by a user. Which actions trigger an event can be configurable. Which events have feed tracked updates created and which feed updates are sent to which users can also be configurable. Messages and feed updates can be stored as a field or child object of the record. For example the feed can be stored as a child object of the record.

A group is generally a collection of users. In some implementations the group may be defined as users with a same or similar attribute or by membership. In one implementation a group feed includes any feed item about any user in a group. In another implementation the group feed includes feed items that are about the group as a whole. In one implementation the feed items for a group are only posts and comments.

An entity feed or record feed generally refers to a feed of feed items about a particular record in the database such as feed tracked updates about changes to the record and posts made by users about the record. An entity feed can be composed of any type of feed item. Such a feed can be displayed on a page such as a web page associated with the record e.g. a home page of the record. As used herein a profile feed is a feed of feed items about a particular user. In one implementation the feed items for a profile feed are posts and comments that other users make about or send to the particular user and status updates made by the particular user. Such a profile feed can be displayed on a page associated with the particular user. In another implementation feed items in a profile feed could include posts made by the particular user and feed tracked updates initiated based on actions of the particular user.

Systems apparatus and methods are provided for implementing enterprise level social and business information networking. Such implementations can provide more efficient use of a database system. For instance a user of a database system may not easily know when important information in the database has changed e.g. about a project or client. Implementations can provide feed tracked updates about such changes and other events thereby keeping users informed.

By way of example a user can update a record e.g. an opportunity such as a possible sale of 1000 computers . Once the record update has been made a feed tracked update about the record update can then automatically be sent e.g. in a feed to anyone subscribing to the opportunity or to the user. Thus the user does not need to contact a manager regarding the change in the opportunity since the feed tracked update about the update is sent via a feed right to the manager s feed page or other page .

Next mechanisms and methods for providing systems implementing enterprise level social and business information networking will be described with reference to example implementations. First an overview of an example database system is described and then examples of tracking events for a record actions of a user and messages about a user or record are described. Various implementations about the data structure of feeds customizing feeds user selection of records and users to follow generating feeds and displaying feeds are also described.

Environment is an environment in which an on demand database service exists. User system may be any machine or system that is used by a user to access a database system . For example any of user systems can be a handheld computing device a mobile phone a laptop computer a work station and or a network of such computing devices. As illustrated in and in more detail in user systems might interact via a network with an on demand database service which is implemented in the example of as database system .

An on demand database service such as system is a database system that is made available to outside users who do not need to necessarily be concerned with building and or maintaining the database system. Instead the database system may be available for their use when the users need the database system i.e. on the demand of the users. Some on demand database services may store information from one or more tenants into tables of a common database image to form a multi tenant database system MTS . A database image may include one or more database objects. A relational database management system RDBMS or the equivalent may execute storage and retrieval of information against the database object s . Application platform may be a framework that allows the applications of system to run such as the hardware and or software e.g. the operating system. In some implementations application platform enables creation managing and executing one or more applications developed by the provider of the on demand database service users accessing the on demand database service via user systems or third party application developers accessing the on demand database service via user systems .

The users of user systems may differ in their respective capacities and the capacity of a particular user system might be entirely determined by permissions permission levels for the current user. For example where a salesperson is using a particular user system to interact with system that user system has the capacities allotted to that salesperson. However while an administrator is using that user system to interact with system that user system has the capacities allotted to that administrator. In systems with a hierarchical role model users at one permission level may have access to applications data and database information accessible by a lower permission level user but may not have access to certain applications database information and data accessible by a user at a higher permission level. Thus different users will have different capabilities with regard to accessing and modifying application and database information depending on a user s security or permission level also called authorization.

Network is any network or combination of networks of devices that communicate with one another. For example network can be any one or any combination of a LAN local area network WAN wide area network telephone network wireless network point to point network star network token ring network hub network or other appropriate configuration. Network can include a TCP IP Transfer Control Protocol and Internet Protocol network such as the global internetwork of networks often referred to as the Internet with a capital I. The Internet will be used in many of the examples herein. However it should be understood that the networks that the present implementations might use are not so limited although TCP IP is a frequently implemented protocol.

User systems might communicate with system using TCP IP and at a higher network level use other common Internet protocols to communicate such as HTTP FTP AFS WAP etc. In an example where HTTP is used user system might include an HTTP client commonly referred to as a browser for sending and receiving HTTP signals to and from an HTTP server at system . Such an HTTP server might be implemented as the sole network interface between system and network but other techniques might be used as well or instead. In some implementations the network interface between system and network includes load sharing functionality such as round robin HTTP request distributors to balance loads and distribute incoming HTTP requests evenly over a plurality of servers. At least for users accessing system each of the plurality of servers has access to the MTS data however other alternative configurations may be used instead.

In one implementation system shown in implements a web based customer relationship management CRM system. For example in one implementation system includes application servers configured to implement and execute CRM software applications as well as provide related data code forms web pages and other information to and from user systems and to store to and retrieve from a database system related data objects and Webpage content. With a multi tenant system data for multiple tenants may be stored in the same physical database object in tenant data storage however tenant data typically is arranged in the storage medium s of tenant data storage so that data of one tenant is kept logically separate from that of other tenants so that one tenant does not have access to another tenant s data unless such data is expressly shared. In certain implementations system implements applications other than or in addition to a CRM application. For example system may provide tenant access to multiple hosted standard and custom applications including a CRM application. User or third party developer applications which may or may not include CRM may be supported by the application platform which manages creation storage of the applications into one or more database objects and executing of the applications in a virtual machine in the process space of the system .

One arrangement for elements of system is shown in including a network interface application platform tenant data storage for tenant data system data storage for system data accessible to system and possibly multiple tenants program code for implementing various functions of system and a process space for executing MTS system processes and tenant specific processes such as running applications as part of an application hosting service. Additional processes that may execute on system include database indexing processes.

Several elements in the system shown in include conventional well known elements that are explained only briefly here. For example each user system could include a desktop personal computer workstation laptop PDA cell phone or any wireless access protocol WAP enabled device or any other computing device capable of interfacing directly or indirectly to the Internet or other network connection. The term computing device is also referred to herein simply as a computer . User system typically runs an HTTP client e.g. a browsing program such as Microsoft s Internet Explorer browser Netscape s Navigator browser Opera s browser or a WAP enabled browser in the case of a cell phone PDA or other wireless device or the like allowing a user e.g. subscriber of the multi tenant database system of user system to access process and view information pages and applications available to it from system over network . Each user system also typically includes one or more user interface devices such as a keyboard a mouse trackball touch pad touch screen pen or the like for interacting with a graphical user interface GUI provided by the browser on a display e.g. a monitor screen LCD display etc. of the computing device in conjunction with pages forms applications and other information provided by system or other systems or servers. For example the user interface device can be used to access data and applications hosted by system and to perform searches on stored data and otherwise allow a user to interact with various GUI pages that may be presented to a user. As discussed above implementations are suitable for use with the Internet although other networks can be used instead of or in addition to the Internet such as an intranet an extranet a virtual private network VPN a non TCP IP based network any LAN or WAN or the like.

According to one implementation each user system and all of its components are operator configurable using applications such as a browser including computer code run using a central processing unit such as an Intel Pentium processor or the like. Similarly system and additional instances of an MTS where more than one is present and all of its components might be operator configurable using application s including computer code to run using processor system which may be implemented to include a central processing unit which may include an Intel Pentium processor or the like and or multiple processor units. A computer program product implementation includes a non transitory computer readable storage medium media having instructions stored thereon in which can be used to program a computing device to perform any of the processes methods of the implementations described herein. Computer program code for operating and configuring system to intercommunicate and to process web pages applications and other data and media content as described herein is preferably downloadable and stored on a hard disk but the entire program code or portions thereof may also be stored in any other volatile or non volatile memory medium or device as is well known such as a ROM or RAM or provided on any media capable of storing program code such as any type of rotating media including floppy disks optical discs digital versatile disk DVD compact disk CD microdrive and magneto optical disks and magnetic or optical cards nanosystems including molecular memory ICs or any type of media or device suitable for storing instructions and or data. Additionally the entire program code or portions thereof may be transmitted and downloaded from a software source over a transmission medium e.g. over the Internet or from another server as is well known or transmitted over any other conventional network connection as is well known e.g. extranet VPN LAN etc. using any communication medium and protocols e.g. TCP IP HTTP HTTPS Ethernet etc. as are well known. It will also be appreciated that computer code for the disclosed implementations can be realized in any programming language that can be executed on a client system and or server or server system such as for example C C HTML any other markup language Java JavaScript ActiveX any other scripting language such as VBScript and many other programming languages as are well known may be used. Java is a trademark of Sun Microsystems Inc. .

According to some implementations each system is configured to provide web pages forms applications data and media content to user client systems to support the access by user systems as tenants of system . As such system provides security mechanisms to keep each tenant s data separate unless the data is shared. If more than one MTS is used they may be located in close proximity to one another e.g. in a server farm located in a single building or campus or they may be distributed at locations remote from one another e.g. one or more servers located in city A and one or more servers located in city B . As used herein each MTS could include one or more logically and or physically connected servers distributed locally or across one or more geographic locations. Additionally the term server is meant to refer to a computing device or system including processing hardware and process space s an associated storage system such as a memory device or database and in some instances a database application e.g. OODBMS or RDBMS as is well known in the art. It should also be understood that server system and server are often used interchangeably herein. Similarly the database objects described herein can be implemented as single databases a distributed database a collection of distributed databases a database with redundant online or offline backups or other redundancies etc. and might include a distributed database or storage network and associated processing intelligence.

User system network system tenant data storage and system data storage were discussed above in . Regarding user system processor system A may be any combination of one or more processors. Memory system B may be any combination of one or more memory devices short term and or long term memory. Input system C may be any combination of input devices such as one or more keyboards mice trackballs scanners cameras and or interfaces to networks. Output system D may be any combination of output devices such as one or more monitors printers and or interfaces to networks. As shown by system may include a network interface of implemented as a set of HTTP application servers an application platform tenant data storage and system data storage . Also shown is system process space including individual tenant process spaces and a tenant management process space . Each application server may be configured to communicate with tenant data storage and the tenant data therein and system data storage and the system data therein to serve requests of user systems . The tenant data might be divided into individual tenant storage areas which can be either a physical arrangement and or a logical arrangement of data. Within each tenant storage area user storage and application metadata might be similarly allocated for each user. For example a copy of a user s most recently used MRU items might be stored to user storage . Similarly a copy of MRU items for an entire organization that is a tenant might be stored to tenant storage area . A UI provides a user interface and an API provides an application programmer interface to system resident processes to users and or developers at user systems . The tenant data and the system data may be stored in various databases such as one or more Oracle databases.

Application platform includes an application setup mechanism that supports application developers creation and management of applications which may be saved as metadata into tenant data storage by save routines for execution by subscribers as one or more tenant process spaces managed by tenant management process for example. Invocations to such applications may be coded using PL SOQL that provides a programming language style interface extension to API . A detailed description of some PL SOQL language implementations is discussed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7 730 478 titled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ALLOWING ACCESS TO DEVELOPED APPLICATIONS VIA A MULTI TENANT ON DEMAND DATABASE SERVICE by Craig Weissman issued on Jun. 1 2010 and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. Invocations to applications may be detected by one or more system processes which manage retrieving application metadata for the subscriber making the invocation and executing the metadata as an application in a virtual machine.

Each application server may be communicably coupled to database systems e.g. having access to system data and tenant data via a different network connection. For example one application server might be coupled via the network e.g. the Internet another application server N 1 might be coupled via a direct network link and another application server N might be coupled by yet a different network connection. Transfer Control Protocol and Internet Protocol TCP IP are typical protocols for communicating between application servers and the database system. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other transport protocols may be used to optimize the system depending on the network interconnect used.

In certain implementations each application server is configured to handle requests for any user associated with any organization that is a tenant. Because it is desirable to be able to add and remove application servers from the server pool at any time for any reason there is preferably no server affinity for a user and or organization to a specific application server . In one implementation therefore an interface system implementing a load balancing function e.g. an F5 Big IP load balancer is communicably coupled between the application servers and the user systems to distribute requests to the application servers . In one implementation the load balancer uses a least connections algorithm to route user requests to the application servers . Other examples of load balancing algorithms such as round robin and observed response time also can be used. For example in certain implementations three consecutive requests from the same user could hit three different application servers and three requests from different users could hit the same application server . In this manner by way of example system is multi tenant wherein system handles storage of and access to different objects data and applications across disparate users and organizations.

As an example of storage one tenant might be a company that employs a sales force where each salesperson uses system to manage their sales process. Thus a user might maintain contact data leads data customer follow up data performance data goals and progress data etc. all applicable to that user s personal sales process e.g. in tenant data storage . In an example of a MTS arrangement since all of the data and the applications to access view modify report transmit calculate etc. can be maintained and accessed by a user system having nothing more than network access the user can manage his or her sales efforts and cycles from any of many different user systems. For example if a salesperson is visiting a customer and the customer has Internet access in their lobby the salesperson can obtain critical updates as to that customer while waiting for the customer to arrive in the lobby.

While each user s data might be separate from other users data regardless of the employers of each user some data might be organization wide data shared or accessible by a plurality of users or all of the users for a given organization that is a tenant. Thus there might be some data structures managed by system that are allocated at the tenant level while other data structures might be managed at the user level. Because an MTS might support multiple tenants including possible competitors the MTS should have security protocols that keep data applications and application use separate. Also because many tenants may opt for access to an MTS rather than maintain their own system redundancy up time and backup are additional functions that may be implemented in the MTS. In addition to user specific data and tenant specific data system might also maintain system level data usable by multiple tenants or other data. Such system level data might include industry reports news postings and the like that are sharable among tenants.

In certain implementations user systems which may be client systems communicate with application servers to request and update system level and tenant level data from system that may require sending one or more queries to tenant data storage and or system data storage . System e.g. an application server in system automatically generates one or more SQL statements e.g. one or more SQL queries that are designed to access the desired information. System data storage may generate query plans to access the requested data from the database.

Each database can generally be viewed as a collection of objects such as a set of logical tables containing data fitted into predefined categories. A table is one representation of a data object and may be used herein to simplify the conceptual description of objects and custom data structures according to some implementations. It should be understood that table and object may be used interchangeably herein. Each table generally contains one or more data categories logically arranged as columns or fields in a viewable schema. Each row or record of a table contains an instance of data for each category defined by the fields. For example a CRM database may include a table that describes a customer with fields for basic contact information such as name address phone number fax number etc. Another table might describe a purchase order including fields for information such as customer product sale price date etc. In some multi tenant database systems standard entity tables might be provided for use by all tenants. For CRM database applications such standard entities might include tables for case account contact lead and opportunity data objects each containing pre defined fields. It should be understood that the word entity may also be used interchangeably herein with object and table .

In some multi tenant database systems tenants may be allowed to create and store custom data structures or they may be allowed to customize standard entities or objects for example by creating custom fields for standard objects including custom index fields. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7 779 039 titled CUSTOM ENTITIES AND FIELDS IN A MULTI TENANT DATABASE SYSTEM by Weissman et al. issued on Aug. 17 2010 and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes teaches systems and methods for creating custom data structures as well as customizing standard objects in a multi tenant database system. In certain implementations for example all custom entity data rows are stored in a single multi tenant physical table which may contain multiple logical tables per organization. It is transparent to customers that their multiple tables are in fact stored in one large table or that their data may be stored in the same table as the data of other customers.

As shown in accessing an on demand service environment may involve communications transmitted among a variety of different hardware and or software components. Further the on demand service environment is a simplified representation of an actual on demand service environment. For example while only one or two devices of each type are shown in some implementations of an on demand service environment may include anywhere from one to many devices of each type. Also the on demand service environment need not include each device shown in or may include additional devices not shown in .

Moreover one or more of the devices in the on demand service environment may be implemented on the same physical device or on different hardware. Some devices may be implemented using hardware or a combination of hardware and software. Thus terms such as data processing apparatus machine server and device as used herein are not limited to a single hardware device but rather include any hardware and software configured to provide the described functionality.

The cloud is intended to refer to a data network or plurality of data networks often including the Internet. Client machines located in the cloud may communicate with the on demand service environment to access services provided by the on demand service environment. For example client machines may access the on demand service environment to retrieve store edit and or process information.

In some implementations the edge routers and route packets between the cloud and other components of the on demand service environment . The edge routers and may employ the Border Gateway Protocol BGP . The BGP is the core routing protocol of the Internet. The edge routers and may maintain a table of IP networks or prefixes which designate network reachability among autonomous systems on the Internet.

In one or more implementations the firewall may protect the inner components of the on demand service environment from Internet traffic. The firewall may block permit or deny access to the inner components of the on demand service environment based upon a set of rules and other criteria. The firewall may act as one or more of a packet filter an application gateway a stateful filter a proxy server or any other type of firewall.

In some implementations the core switches and are high capacity switches that transfer packets within the on demand service environment . The core switches and may be configured as network bridges that quickly route data between different components within the on demand service environment. In some implementations the use of two or more core switches and may provide redundancy and or reduced latency.

In some implementations the pods and may perform the core data processing and service functions provided by the on demand service environment. Each pod may include various types of hardware and or software computing resources. An example of the pod architecture is discussed in greater detail with reference to .

In some implementations communication between the pods and may be conducted via the pod switches and . The pod switches and may facilitate communication between the pods and and client machines located in the cloud for example via core switches and . Also the pod switches and may facilitate communication between the pods and and the database storage .

In some implementations the load balancer may distribute workload between the pods and . Balancing the on demand service requests between the pods may assist in improving the use of resources increasing throughput reducing response times and or reducing overhead. The load balancer may include multilayer switches to analyze and forward traffic.

In some implementations access to the database storage may be guarded by a database firewall . The database firewall may act as a computer application firewall operating at the database application layer of a protocol stack. The database firewall may protect the database storage from application attacks such as structure query language SQL injection database rootkits and unauthorized information disclosure.

In some implementations the database firewall may include a host using one or more forms of reverse proxy services to proxy traffic before passing it to a gateway router. The database firewall may inspect the contents of database traffic and block certain content or database requests. The database firewall may work on the SQL application level atop the TCP IP stack managing applications connection to the database or SQL management interfaces as well as intercepting and enforcing packets traveling to or from a database network or application interface.

In some implementations communication with the database storage may be conducted via the database switch . The multi tenant database storage may include more than one hardware and or software components for handling database queries. Accordingly the database switch may direct database queries transmitted by other components of the on demand service environment e.g. the pods and to the correct components within the database storage .

In some implementations the database storage is an on demand database system shared by many different organizations. The on demand database system may employ a multi tenant approach a virtualized approach or any other type of database approach. An on demand database system is discussed in greater detail with reference to .

In some implementations the app servers may include a hardware and or software framework dedicated to the execution of procedures e.g. programs routines scripts for supporting the construction of applications provided by the on demand service environment via the pod . In some implementations the hardware and or software framework of an app server is configured to execute operations of the services described herein including performance of the blocks of methods processes described with reference to . In alternative implementations two or more app servers may be included and cooperate to perform such methods or one or more other servers in can be configured to perform the disclosed methods.

The content batch servers may requests internal to the pod. These requests may be long running and or not tied to a particular customer. For example the content batch servers may handle requests related to log mining cleanup work and maintenance tasks.

The content search servers may provide query and indexer functions. For example the functions provided by the content search servers may allow users to search through content stored in the on demand service environment.

The file force servers may manage requests information stored in the Fileforce storage . The Fileforce storage may store information such as documents images and basic large objects BLOBs . By managing requests for information using the file force servers the image footprint on the database may be reduced.

The query servers may be used to retrieve information from one or more file systems. For example the query system may receive requests for information from the app servers and then transmit information queries to the NFS located outside the pod.

The pod may share a database instance configured as a multi tenant environment in which different organizations share access to the same database. Additionally services rendered by the pod may require various hardware and or software resources. In some implementations the ACS servers may control access to data hardware resources or software resources.

In some implementations the batch servers may process batch jobs which are used to run tasks at specified times. Thus the batch servers may transmit instructions to other servers such as the app servers to trigger the batch jobs.

In some implementations the QFS may be an open source file system available from Sun Microsystems of Santa Clara Calif. The QFS may serve as a rapid access file system for storing and accessing information available within the pod . The QFS may support some volume management capabilities allowing many disks to be grouped together into a file system. File system metadata can be kept on a separate set of disks which may be useful for streaming applications where long disk seeks cannot be tolerated. Thus the QFS system may communicate with one or more content search servers and or indexers to identify retrieve move and or update data stored in the network file systems and or other storage systems.

In some implementations one or more query servers may communicate with the NFS to retrieve and or update information stored outside of the pod . The NFS may allow servers located in the pod to access information to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed.

In some implementations queries from the query servers may be transmitted to the NFS via the load balancer which may distribute resource requests over various resources available in the on demand service environment. The NFS may also communicate with the QFS to update the information stored on the NFS and or to provide information to the QFS for use by servers located within the pod .

In some implementations the pod may include one or more database instances . The database instance may transmit information to the QFS . When information is transmitted to the QFS it may be available for use by servers within the pod without requiring an additional database call.

In some implementations database information may be transmitted to the indexer . Indexer may provide an index of information available in the database and or QFS . The index information may be provided to file force servers and or the QFS .

As multiple users might be able to change the data of a record it can be useful for certain users to be notified when a record is updated. Also even if a user does not have authority to change a record the user still might want to know when there is an update to the record. For example a vendor may negotiate a new price with a salesperson of company X where the salesperson is a user associated with tenant Y. As part of creating a new invoice or for accounting purposes the salesperson can change the price saved in the database. It may be important for co workers to know that the price has changed. The salesperson could send an e mail to certain people but this is onerous and the salesperson might not e mail all of the people who need to know or want to know. Accordingly some implementations of the disclosed techniques can inform others e.g. co workers who want to know about an update to a record automatically.

In block the database system receives a request to update a first record. In one implementation the request is received from a first user. For example a user may be accessing a page associated with the first record and may change a displayed field and hit save. In another implementation the database system can automatically create the request. For instance the database system can create the request in response to another event e.g. a request to change a field could be sent periodically at a particular date and or time of day or a change to another field or object. The database system can obtain a new value based on other fields of a record and or based on parameters in the system.

The request for the update of a field of a record is an example of an event associated with the first record for which a feed tracked update may be created. In other implementations the database system can identify other events besides updates to fields of a record. For example an event can be a submission of approval to change a field. Such an event can also have an associated field e.g. a field showing a status of whether a change has been submitted . Other examples of events can include creation of a record deletion of a record converting a record from one type to another e.g. converting a lead to an opportunity closing a record e.g. a case type record and potentially any other state change of a record any of which could include a field change associated with the state change. Any of these events update the record whether by changing a field of the record a state of the record or some other characteristic or property of the record. In one implementation a list of supported events for creating a feed tracked update can be maintained within the database system e.g. at a server or in a database.

In block the database system writes new data to the first record. In one implementation the new data may include a new value that replaces old data. For example a field is updated with a new value. In another implementation the new data can be a value for a field that did not contain data before. In yet another implementation the new data could be a flag e.g. for a status of the record which can be stored as a field of the record.

In some implementations a field can also include records which are child objects of the first record in a parent child hierarchy. A field can alternatively include a pointer to a child record. A child object itself can include further fields. Thus if a field of a child object is updated with a new value the parent record also can be considered to have a field changed. In one example a field could be a list of related child objects also called a related list.

In block a feed tracked update is generated about the update to the record. In one implementation the feed tracked update is created in parts for assembling later into a display version. For example event entries can be created and tracked in one table and changed field entries can be tracked in another table that is cross referenced with the first table. More specifics of such implementations are provided later e.g. with respect to . In another implementation the feed tracked update is automatically generated by the database system. The feed tracked update can convey in words that the first record has been updated and provide details about what was updated in the record and who performed the update. In some implementations a feed tracked update is generated for only certain types of event and or updates associated with the first record.

In one implementation a tenant e.g. through an administrator can configure the database system to create enable feed tracked updates only for certain types of records. For example an administrator can specify that records of designated types such as accounts and opportunities are enabled. When an update or other event is received for the enabled record type then a feed tracked update would be generated. In another implementation a tenant can also specify the fields of a record whose changes are to be tracked and for which feed tracked updates are created. In one aspect a maximum number of fields can be specified for tracking and may include custom fields. In one implementation the type of change can also be specified for example that the value change of a field is required to be larger than a threshold e.g. an absolute amount or a percentage change . In yet another implementation a tenant can specify which events are to cause a generation of a feed tracked update. Also in one implementation individual users can specify configurations specific to them which can create custom feeds as described in more detail below.

In one implementation changes to fields of a child object are not tracked to create feed tracked updates for the parent record. In another implementation the changes to fields of a child object can be tracked to create feed tracked updates for the parent record. For example a child object of the parent type can be specified for tracking and certain fields of the child object can be specified for tracking. As another example if the child object is of a type specified for tracking then a tracked change for the child object is propagated to parent records of the child object.

In block the feed tracked update is added to a feed for the first record. In one implementation adding the feed tracked update to a feed can include adding events to a table which may be specific to a record or be for all or a group of objects where a display version of a feed tracked update can be generated dynamically and presented as an information update when a user requests a feed for the first record. In another implementation a display version of a feed tracked update can be added when a record feed is stored and maintained for a record. As mentioned above a feed may be maintained for only certain records. In one implementation the feed of a record can be stored in the database associated with the record. For example the feed can be stored as a field e.g. as a child object of the record. Such a field can store a pointer to the text to be displayed for the feed tracked update.

In some implementations only the current feed tracked update or other current feed item may be kept or temporarily stored e.g. in some temporary memory structure. For example a feed tracked update for only a most recent change to any particular field is kept. In other implementations many previous feed tracked updates may be kept in the feed. A time and or date for each feed tracked update can be tracked. Herein a feed of a record is also referred to as an entity feed as a record is an instance of a particular entity object of the database.

In block followers of the first record can be identified. A follower is a user following the first record such as a subscriber to the feed of the first record. In one implementation when a user requests a feed of a particular record such an identification of block can be omitted. In another implementation where a record feed is pushed to a user e.g. as part of a news feed then the user can be identified as a follower of the first record. Accordingly this block can include the identification of records and other objects being followed by a particular user.

In one implementation the database system can store a list of the followers for a particular record. In various implementations the list can be stored with the first record or associated with the record using an identifier e.g. a pointer to retrieve the list. For example the list can be stored in a field of the first record. In another implementation a list of the records that a user is following is used. In one implementation the database system can have a routine that runs for each user where the routine polls the records in the list to determine if a new feed tracked update has been added to a feed of the record. In another implementation the routine for the user can be running at least partially on a user device which contacts the database to perform the polling.

In block in one implementation the feed tracked update can be stored in a table as described in greater detail below. When the user opens a feed an appropriate query is sent to one or more tables to retrieve updates to records also described in greater detail below. In some implementations the feed shows feed tracked updates in reverse chronological order. In one implementation the feed tracked update is pushed to the feed of a user e.g. by a routine that determines the followers for the record from a list associated with the record. In another implementation the feed tracked update is pulled to a feed e.g. by a user device. This pulling may occur when a user requests the feed as occurs in block . Thus these actions may occur in a different order. The creation of the feed for a pull may be a dynamic creation that identifies records being followed by the requesting user generates the display version of relevant feed tracked updates from stored information e.g. event and field change and adds the feed tracked updates into the feed. A feed of feed tracked updates of records and other objects that a user is following is also generally referred to herein as a news feed which can be a subset of a larger information feed in which other types of information updates appear such as posts.

In yet another implementation the feed tracked update could be sent as an e mail to the follower instead of in a feed. In one implementation e mail alerts for events can enable people to be e mailed when certain events occur. In another implementation e mails can be sent when there are posts on a user profile and posts on entities to which the user subscribes. In one implementation a user can turn on off email alerts for all or some events. In an implementation a user can specify what kind of feed tracked updates to receive about a record that the user is following. For example a user can choose to only receive feed tracked updates about certain fields of a record that the user is following and potentially about what kind of update was performed e.g. a new value input into a specified field or the creation of a new field .

In block a follower can access his her news feed to see the feed tracked update. In one implementation the user has just one news feed for all of the records that the user is following. In one aspect a user can access his her own feed by selecting a particular tab or other object on a page of an interface to the database system. Once selected the feed can be provided as a list e.g. with an identifier e.g. a time or including some or all of the text of the feed tracked update. In another implementation the user can specify how the feed tracked updates are to be displayed and or sent to the user. For example a user can specify a font for the text a location of where the feed can be selected and displayed amount of text to be displayed and other text or symbols to be displayed e.g. importance flags .

A first user sends a request to update record in database system . Although an update request is described other events that are being tracked are equally applicable. In various implementations the request can be sent via a user interface e.g. of or an application program interface e.g. API . An I O port can accommodate the signals of request via any input interface and send the signals to one or more processors . The processor can analyze the request and determine actions to be performed. Herein any reference to a processor can refer to a specific processor or any set of processors in database system which can be collectively referred to as processor .

Processor can determine an identifier for record and send commands with the new data of the request to record database to update record . In one implementation record database is where tenant data of is stored. The request and new data commands can be encapsulated in a single write transaction sent to record database . In one implementation multiple changes to records in the database can be made in a single write transaction.

Processor can also analyze request to determine whether a feed tracked update is to be created which at this point may include determining whether the event e.g. a change to a particular field is to be tracked. This determination can be based on an interaction i.e. an exchange of data with record database and or other databases or based on information stored locally e.g. in cache or RAM at processor . In one implementation a list of record types that are being tracked can be stored. The list may be different for each tenant e.g. as each tenant may configure the database system to its own specifications. Thus if the record is of a type not being tracked then the determination of whether to create a feed tracked update can stop there.

The same list or a second list which can be stored in a same location or a different location can also include the fields and or events that are tracked for the record types in the first list. This list can be searched to determine if the event is being tracked. A list may also contain information having the granularity of listing specific records that are to be tracked e.g. if a tenant can specify the particular records to be tracked as opposed to just type .

As an example processor may obtain an identifier associated with record e.g. obtained from request or database potentially along with a tenant identifier and cross reference the identifier with a list of records for which feed tracked updates are to be created. Specifically the record identifier can be used to determine the record type and a list of tracked types can be searched for a match. The specific record may also be checked if such individual record tracking was enabled. The name of the field to be changed can also be used to search a list of tracking enabled fields. Other criteria besides field and events can be used to determine whether a feed tracked update is created e.g. type of change in the field. If a feed tracked update is to be generated processor can then generate the feed tracked update.

In some implementations a feed tracked update is created dynamically when a feed e.g. the entity feed of record is requested. Thus in one implementation a feed tracked update can be created when a user requests the entity feed for record . In this implementation the feed tracked update may be created e.g. assembled including re created each time the entity feed is to be displayed to any user. In one implementation one or more hifeed tracked update tables can keep track of previous events so that the feed tracked update can be re created.

In another implementation a feed tracked update can be created at the time the event occurs and the feed tracked update can be added to a list of feed items. The list of feed items may be specific to record or may be an aggregate of feed items including feed items for many records. Such an aggregate list can include a record identifier so that the feed items for the entity feed of record can be easily retrieved. For example after the feed tracked update has been generated processor can add the new feed tracked update to a feed of record . As mentioned above in one implementation the feed can be stored in a field e.g. as a child object of record . In another implementation the feed can be stored in another location or in another database but with a link e.g. a connecting identifier to record . The feed can be organized in various ways e.g. as a linked list an array or other data structure.

A second user can access the new feed tracked update in various ways. In one implementation second user can send a request for the record feed. For example second user can access a home page detail page of the record e.g. with a query or by browsing and the feed can be obtained through a tab button or other activation object on the page. The feed can be displayed on the screen or downloaded.

In another implementation processor can add the new feed tracked update to a feed e.g. a news feed of a user that is following record . In one implementation processor can determine each of the followers of record by accessing a list of the users that have been registered as followers. This determination can be done for each new event e.g. update . In another implementation processor can poll e.g. with a query the records that second user is following to determine when new feed tracked updates or other feed items are available. Processor can use a follower profile of second user that can contain a list of the records that the second user is following. Such a list can be contained in other parts of the database as well. Second user can then send a request to his her profile to obtain a feed which contains the new feed tracked update. The user s profile can be stored in a profile database which can be the same or different than database .

In some implementations a user can define a news feed to include new feed tracked updates from various records which may be limited to a maximum number. In one implementation each user has one news feed. In another implementation the follower profile can include the specifications of each of the records to be followed with the criteria for what feed tracked updates are to be provided and how they are displayed as well as the feed.

Some implementations can provide various types of record entity feeds. Entity Feeds can exist for record types like account opportunity case and contact. An entity feed can tell a user about the actions that people have taken on that particular record or on one its related records. The entity feed can include who made the action which field was changed and the old and new values. In one implementation entity feeds can exist on all supported records as a list that is linked to the specific record. For example a feed could be stored in a field that allows lists e.g. linked lists or as a child object.

In addition to knowing about events associated with a particular record it can be helpful for a user to know what a particular user is doing. In particular it might be nice to know what the user is doing without the user having to generate the feed tracked update e.g. a user submitting a synopsis of what the user has done . Accordingly implementations can automatically track actions of a user that trigger events and feed tracked updates can be generated for certain events.

In block a database system e.g. of identifies an action of a first user. In one implementation the action triggers an event and the event is identified. For example the action of a user requesting an update to a record can be identified where the event is receiving a request or is the resulting update of a record. The action may thus be defined by the resulting event. In another implementation only certain types of actions events are identified. Which actions are identified can be set as a default or can be configurable by a tenant or even configurable at a user level. In this way processing effort can be reduced since only some actions are identified.

In block it is determined whether the event qualifies for a feed tracked update. In one implementation a predefined list of events e.g. as mentioned herein can be created so that only certain actions are identified. In one implementation an administrator or other user of a tenant can specify the type of actions events for which a feed tracked update is to be generated. This block may also be performed for method .

In block a feed tracked update is generated about the action. In an example where the action is an update of a record the feed tracked update can be similar or the same as the feed tracked update created for the record. The description can be altered though to focus on the user as opposed to the record. For example John D. has closed a new opportunity for account XYZ as opposed to an opportunity has been closed for account XYZ. 

In block the feed tracked update is added to a profile feed of the first user when e.g. the user clicks on a tab to open a page in a browser program displaying the feed. In one implementation a feed for a particular user can be accessed on a page of the user s profile in a similar manner as a record feed can be accessed on a detail page of the record. In another implementation the first user may not have a profile feed and the feed tracked update may just be stored temporarily before proceeding. A profile feed of a user can be stored associated with the user s profile. This profile feed can be added to a news feed of another user.

In block followers of the first user are identified. In one implementation a user can specify which type of actions other users can follow. Similarly in one implementation a follower can select what actions by a user the follower wants to follow. In an implementation where different followers follow different types of actions which users are followers of that user and the particular action can be identified e.g. using various lists that track what actions and criteria are being followed by a particular user. In various implementations the followers of the first user can be identified in a similar manner as followers of a record as described above for block .

In block the feed tracked update is added to a news feed of each follower of the first user when e.g. the follower clicks on a tab to open a page displaying the news feed. The feed tracked update can be added in a similar manner as the feed items for a record feed. The news feed can contain feed tracked updates both about users and records. In another implementation a user can specify what kind of feed tracked updates to receive about a user that the user is following. For example a user could specify feed tracked updates with particular keywords of certain types of records of records owned or created by certain users particular fields and other criteria as mentioned herein.

In block a follower accesses the news feed and sees the feed tracked update. In one implementation the user has just one news feed for all of the records that the user is following. In another implementation a user can access his her own feed i.e. feed about his her own actions by selecting a particular tab or other object on a page of an interface to the database system. Thus a feed can include feed tracked updates about what other users are doing in the database system. When a user becomes aware of a relevant action of another user the user can contact the co worker thereby fostering teamwork.

As described above some implementations can generate text describing events e.g. updates that have occurred for a record and actions by a user that trigger an event. A database system can be configured to generate the feed tracked updates for various events in various ways.

In a database system there are various events that can be detected. However the operator of the database system and or a tenant may not want to detect every possible event as this could be costly with regards to performance. Accordingly the operator and or the tenant can configure the database system to only detect certain events. For example an update of a record may be an event that is to be detected.

Out of the events that are detected a tenant including a specific user of the tenant may not want a feed tracked update about each detected event. For example all updates to a record may be identified at a first level. Then based on specifications of an administrator and or a specific user of a tenant another level of inquiry can be made as to whether a feed tracked update is to be generated about the detected event. For example the events that qualify for a feed tracked update can be restricted to changes for only certain fields of the record and can differ depending on which user is receiving the feed. In one implementation a database system can track whether an event qualifies for a feed tracked update for any user and once the feed tracked update is generated it can be determined who is to receive the feed tracked update.

Supported events events for which a feed tracked update is generated can include actions for standard fields custom fields and standard related lists. Regarding standard fields for the entity feed and the profile feed a standard field update can trigger a feed tracked update to be presented in that feed. In one implementation which standard field can create a feed tracked update can be set by an administrator to be the same for every user. In another implementation a user can set which standard fields create a feed tracked update for that user s news feed. Custom fields can be treated the same or differently than standard fields.

The generation of a feed item can also depend on a relationship of an object to other objects e.g. parent child relationships . For example if a child object is updated a feed tracked update may be written to a feed of a parent of the child object. The level of relationship can be configured e.g. only 1 level of separation i.e. no grandparent grandchild relationship . Also in one implementation a feed tracked update is generated only for objects above the objects being updated i.e. a feed tracked update is not written for a child when the parent is updated.

In some implementations for related lists of a record a feed tracked update is written to its parent record 1 level only when the related list item is added and not when the list item is changed or deleted. For example user A added a new opportunity XYZ for account ABC. In this manner entity feeds can be controlled so as not to be cluttered with feed tracked updates about changes to their related items. Any changes to the related list item can be tracked on their own entity feed if that related list item has a feed on it. In this implementation if a user wants to see a feed of the related list item then the user can subscribe to it. Such a subscription might be when a user cares about a specific opportunity related to a specific account. A user can also browse to that object s entity feed. Other implementations can create a feed tracked update when a related entity is changed or deleted.

In one implementation an administrator of the system or of a specific tenant can define which events of which related objects are to have feed tracked updates written about them in a parent record. In another implementation a user can define which related object events to show. In one implementation there are two types of related lists of related objects first class lookup and second class lookup. Each of the records in the related lists can have a different rule for whether a feed tracked update is generated for a parent record. Each of these related lists can be composed as custom related lists. In various implementations a custom related list can be composed of custom data structures the lists can contain a variety of records or items e.g. not restricted to a particular type of record or item and can be displayed in a customized manner.

In one implementation a first class lookup contains records of a child record that can exist by itself. For example the contacts on an account exist as a separate record and also as a child record of the account. In another implementation a record in a first class lookup can have its own feed which can be displayed on its detail page.

In one implementation a second class lookup can have line items existing only in the context of their parent record e.g. activities on an opportunity contact roles on opportunity contact . In one implementation the line items are not objects themselves and thus there is no detail page and no place to put a feed. In another implementation a change in a second class lookup can be reported on the feed of the parent.

Some implementations can also create feed tracked updates for dependent field changes. A dependent field change is a field that changes value when another field changes and thus the field has a value that is dependent on the value of the other field. For example a dependent field might be a sum or other formula that totals values in other fields and thus the dependent field would change when one of the fields being summed changes. Accordingly in one implementation a change in one field could create feed tracked updates for multiple fields. In other implementations feed tracked updates are not created for dependent fields.

After it is determined that a feed tracked update is going to be generated some implementations can also determine how the feed tracked update is generated. In one implementation different methods can be used for different events e.g. in a similar fashion as for the configurability of which events feed tracked updates are generated. A feed tracked update can also include a description of multiple events e.g. john changed the account status and amount .

In one implementation the feed tracked update is a grammatical sentence thereby being easily understandable by a person. In another implementation the feed tracked update provides detailed information about the update. In various examples an old value and new value for a field may be included in the feed tracked update an action for the update may be provided e.g. submitted for approval and the names of particular users that are responsible for replying or acting on the feed tracked update may be also provided. The feed tracked update can also have a level of importance based on settings chosen by the administrator a particular user requesting an update or by a following user who is to receive the feed tracked update which fields is updated a percentage of the change in a field the type of event or any combination of these factors.

The system may have a set of heuristics for creating a feed tracked update from the event e.g. a request to update . For example the subject may be the user the record or a field being added or changed. The verb can be based on the action requested by the user which can be selected from a list of verbs which may be provided as defaults or input by an administrator of a tenant . In one implementation feed tracked updates can be generic containers with formatting restrictions 

As an example of a feed tracked update for a creation of a new record Mark Abramowitz created a new Opportunity for IBM 20 000 laptops with Amount as 3.5M and Sam Palmisano as Decision Maker. This event can be posted to the profile feed for Mark Abramowitz and the entity feed for record of Opportunity for IBM 20 000 laptops. The pattern can be given by AgentFullName created a new ObjectName RecordName with FieldName as FieldValue and added changed removed RelatedListRecordName as to as RelatedListRecordValue and . Similar patterns can be formed for a changed field standard or custom and an added child record to a related list.

Some implementations can also have a user submit text instead of the database system generating a feed tracked update. As the text is submitted as part or all of a message by a user the text can be about any topic. Thus more information than just actions of a user and events of a record can be conveyed. In one implementation the messages can be used to ask a question about a particular record and users following the record can provide comments and responses.

In block the database system receives a message e.g. a post or status update associated with a first user. The message e.g. a post or status update can contain text and or multimedia content submitted by another user or by the first user. In one implementation a post is for a section of the first user s profile page where any user can add a post and where multiple posts can exist. Thus a post can appear on the first user s profile page and can be viewed when the first user s profile is visited. For a message about a record the post can appear on a detail page of a record. Note the message can appear in other feeds as well. In another implementation a status update about the first user can only be added by the first user. In one implementation a user can only have one status message.

In block the message is added to a table as described in greater detail below. When the feed is opened a query filters one or more tables to identify the first user identify other persons that the user is following and retrieve the message. Messages and record updates are presented in a combined list as the feed. In this way in one implementation the message can be added to a profile feed of the first user which is associated e.g. as a related list with the first user s profile. In one implementation the posts are listed indefinitely. In another implementation only the most recent posts e.g. last 50 are kept in the profile feed. Such implementations can also be employed with feed tracked updates. In yet another implementation the message can be added to a profile of the user adding the message.

In block the database system identifies followers of the first user. In one implementation the database system can identify the followers as described above for method . In various implementations a follower can select to follow a feed about the actions of the first user messages about the first user or both potentially in a same feed .

In block the message is added to a news feed of each follower. In one implementation the message is only added to a news feed of a particular follower if the message matches some criteria e.g. the message includes a particular keyword or other criteria. In another implementation a message can be deleted by the user who created the message. In one implementation once deleted by the author the message is deleted from all feeds to which the message had been added.

In block the follower accesses a news feed and sees the message. For example the follower can access a news feed on the follower s own profile page. As another example the follower can have a news feed sent to his her own desktop without having to first go to a home page.

In block the database system receives a comment about the message. The database system can add the comment to a feed of the same first user much as the original message was added. In one implementation the comment can also be added to a feed of a second user who added the comment. In one implementation users can also reply to the comment. In another implementation users can add comments to a feed tracked update and further comments can be associated with the feed tracked update. In yet another implementation making a comment or message is not an action to which a feed tracked update is created. Thus the message may be the only feed item created from such an action.

In one implementation if a feed tracked update or post is deleted its corresponding comments are deleted as well. In another implementation new comments on a feed tracked update or post do not update the feed tracked update timestamp. Also the feed tracked update or post can continue to be shown in a feed profile feed record feed or news feed if it has had a comment within a specified timeframe e.g. within the last week . Otherwise the feed tracked update or post can be removed in an implementation.

In some implementations all or most feed tracked updates can be commented on. In other implementations feed tracked updates for certain records e.g. cases or ideas are not commentable. In various implementations comments can be made for any one or more records of opportunities accounts contacts leads and custom data structures.

In block the comment is added to a news feed of each follower. In one implementation a user can make the comment within the user s news feed. Such a comment can propagate to the appropriate profile feed or record feed and then to the news feeds of the following users. Thus feeds can include what people are saying as well as what they are doing. In one aspect feeds are a way to stay up to date e.g. on users opportunities etc. as well as an opportunity to reach out to co workers partners and engage them around common goals.

In some implementations users can rate feed tracked updates or messages including comments . A user can choose to prioritize a display of a feed so that higher rated feed items show up higher on a display. For example in an implementation where comments are answers to a specific question users can rate the different status posts so that a best answer can be identified. As another example users are able to quickly identify feed items that are most important as those feed items can be displayed at a top of a list. The order of the feed items can be based on an importance level which can be determined by the database system using various factors some of which are mentioned herein and based on a rating from users. In one implementation the rating is on a scale that includes at least 3 values. In another implementation the rating is based on a binary scale.

Besides a profile for a user a group can also be created. In various implementations the group can be created based on certain criteria that are common to the users can be created by inviting users or can be created by receiving requests to join from a user. In one implementation a group feed can be created with messages being added to the group feed when someone adds a message to the group as a whole. For example a group page may have a section for posts. In another implementation a message can be added to a group feed when a message is added about any one of the members. In yet another implementation a group feed can include feed tracked updates about actions of the group as a whole e.g. when an administrator changes data in a group profile or a record owned by the group or about actions of an individual member.

An event hifeed tracked update table can provide a hifeed tracked update of events from which feed items are created. In one aspect the events are for objects that are being tracked. Thus table can store and change hifeed tracked updates for feeds and the changes can be persisted. In various implementations event hifeed tracked update table can have columns of event ID object ID also called parent ID and created by ID . The event ID can uniquely identify a particular event and can start at 1 or other number or value .

Each new event can be added chronologically with a new event ID which may be incremented in order. An object ID can be used to track which record or user s profile is being changed. For example the object ID can correspond to the record whose field is being changed or the user whose feed is receiving a post. The created by ID can track the user who is performing the action that results in the event e.g. the user that is changing the field or that is posting a message to the profile of another user.

In some other implementations event hifeed tracked update table can have one or more of the following variables with certain attributes ORGANIZATION ID being CHAR 15 BYTE FEEDS ENTITY HIFEED TRACKED UPDATE ID being CHAR 15 BYTE PARENT ID being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED BY being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED DATE being a variable of type DATE DIVISION being a NUMBER KEY PREFIX being CHAR 3 BYTE and DELETED being CHAR 1 BYTE . The parent ID can provide an ID of a parent object in case the change is promulgated to the parent. The key prefix can provide a key that is unique to a group of records e.g. custom records objects . The deleted variable can indicate that the feed items for the event are deleted and thus the feed items are not generated. In one implementation the variables for each event entry or any entry in any of the tables may not be nullable. In another implementation all entries in the event hifeed tracked update table are used to create feed items for only one object as specified by the object ID . For example one feed tracked update cannot communicate updates on two records such as updates of an account field and an opportunity field.

In one implementation a name of an event can also be stored in table . In one implementation a tenant can specify events that they want tracked. In an implementation event hifeed tracked update table can include the name of the field that changed e.g. old and new values . In another implementation the name of the field and the values are stored in a separate table. Other information about an event e.g. text of comment feed tracked update post or status update can be stored in event hifeed tracked update table or in other tables as is now described.

A field change table can provide a hifeed tracked update of the changes to the fields. The columns of table can include an event ID which correlates to the event ID an old value for the field and the new value for the field. In one implementation if an event changes more than one field value then there can be an entry for each field changed. As shown event ID has two entries for event E.

In some other implementations field change table can have one or more of the following variables with certain attributes ORGANIZATION ID being CHAR 15 BYTE FEEDS ENTITY HIFEED TRACKED UPDATE FIELDS ID being CHAR 15 BYTE and identifying each entry FEEDS ENTITY HIFEED TRACKED UPDATE ID being CHAR 15 BYTE FIELD KEY being VARCHAR 120 BYTE DATA TYPE being CHAR 1 BYTE OLDVAL STRING VARCHAR being 765 BYTE NEWVAL STRING being VARCHAR 765 BYTE OLDVAL FIRST NAME being VARCHAR 765 BYTE NEWVAL FIRST NAME being VARCHAR 765 BYTE OLDVAL LAST NAME being VARCHAR 765 BYTE NEWVAL LAST NAME being VARCHAR 765 BYTE OLDVAL NUMBER being NUMBER NEWVAL NUMBER being NUMBER OLDVAL DATE being DATE NEWVAL DATE being DATE and DELETED being CHAR 1 BYTE . In one implementation one or more of the variables for each entry in any of the tables may be nullable.

In one implementation the data type variable and or other variables is a non API insertable field. In another implementation variable values can be derived from the record whose field is being changed. Certain values can be transferred into typed columns old new value string old new value number or old new value date depending upon the derived values. In another implementation there can exist a data type for capturing add deletes for child objects. The child ID can be tracked in the foreign key column of the record. In yet another implementation if the field name is pointing to a field in the parent entity a field level security FLS can be used when a user attempts to a view a relevant feed item. Herein security levels for objects and fields are also called access checks and determinations of authorization. In one aspect the access can be for create read write update or delete of objects.

In one implementation the field name or key can be either a field name of the entity or one of the values in a separate list. For example changes that do not involve the update of an existing field e.g. a close or open can have a field name specified in an enumerated list. This enumerated list can store special field name sentinel values for non update actions that a tenant wants to track. In one aspect the API just surfaces these values and the caller has to check the enumerated values to see if it is a special field name.

A comment table can provide a hifeed tracked update of the comments made regarding an event e.g. a comment on a post or a change of a field value. The columns of table can include an event ID which correlates to the event ID the comment column that stores the text of the comment and the time date of the comment. In one implementation there can be multiple comments for each event. As shown event ID has two entries for event E.

In some other implementations comment table can have one or more of the following variables with certain attributes ORGANIZATION ID being CHAR 15 BYTE FEEDS COMMENTS ID being CHAR 15 BYTE and uniquely identifying each comment PARENT ID being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED BY being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED DATE being DATE COMMENTS being VARCHAR 420 BYTE and DELETED being CHAR 1 BYTE .

A user subscription table can provide a list of the objects being followed subscribed to by a user. In one implementation each entry has a user ID of the user doing the following and one object ID corresponding to the object being followed. In one implementation the object being followed can be a record or a user. As shown the user with ID U is following object IDs O and O. If user U is following other objects then additional entries may exist for user U. Also as shown user U is also following object O. The user subscription table can be updated when a user adds or deletes an object that is being followed.

In some other implementations user subscription table can be composed of two tables one for records being followed and one for users being followed . One table can have one or more of the following variables with certain attributes ORGANIZATION ID being CHAR 15 BYTE ENTITY SUBSCRIPTION ID being CHAR 15 BYTE PARENT ID being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED BY being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED DATE being DATE and DELETED being CHAR 1 BYTE . Another table can have one or more of the following variables with certain attributes ORGANIZATION ID being CHAR 15 BYTE USER SUBSCRIPTIONS ID being CHAR 15 BYTE USER ID being CHAR 15 BYTE CREATED BY being CHAR 15 BYTE and CREATED DATE being DATE.

In one implementation regarding a profile feed and a news feed these are read only views on the event hifeed tracked update table specialized for these feed types. Conceptually the news feed can be a semi join between the entity subscriptions table and the event hifeed tracked update table on the object IDs and for the user. In one aspect these entities can have polymorphic parents and can be subject to a number of restrictions detailed herein e.g. to limit the cost of sharing checks.

In one implementation entity feeds are modeled in the API as a feed associate entity e.g. AccountFeed CaseFeed etc . A feed associate entity includes information composed of events e.g. event IDs for only one particular record type. Such a list can limit the query and sharing checks to a specific record type. In one aspect this structuring of the entity feeds can make the query run faster. For example a request for a feed of a particular account can include the record type of account. In one implementation an account feed table can then be searched where the table has account record IDs and corresponding event IDs or pointers to particular event entries in event hifeed tracked update table . Since the account feed table only contains some of the records not all the query can run faster.

In one implementation there may be objects with no events listed in the event hifeed tracked update table even though the record is being tracked. In this case the database service can return a result indicating that no feed items exist.

In another implementation tables can also exist for audit tracking e.g. to examine that operations of the system e.g. access checks are performing accurately. In one implementation audit change hifeed tracked update tables can be persisted e.g. in bulk synchronously in the same transaction as feed events are added to event hifeed tracked update table . In another implementation entries to the two sets of table can be persisted in asynchronous manner e.g. by forking a bulk update into a separate java thread . In one aspect some updates to any of the tables can get lost if the instance of the table goes down while the update has not yet finished. This asynchronous manner can limit an impact performance on save operations. In some implementations a field persistence type tri state AUDIT FEEDS or BOTH can be added to capture user preferences as opposed to being hard coded.

A feed item can represent an individual field change of a record creation and deletion of a record or other events being tracked for a record or a user. In one implementation all of the feed items in a single transaction event can be grouped together and have the same event ID. A single transaction relates to the operations that can be performed in a single communication with the database. In another implementation where a feed is an object of the database a feed item can be a child of a profile feed news feed or entity feed. If a feed item is added to multiple feeds the feed item can be replicated as a child of each feed to which the feed item is added.

In one implementation a feed item is visible only when its parent feed is visible which can be the same as needing read access on the feed s parent which can be by the type of record or by a specific record . The feed item s field may be only visible when allowed under field level security FLS . Unfortunately this can mean that the parent feed may be visible but the child may not be because of FLS. Such access rules are described in more detail below. In one implementation a feed item can be read only. In this implementation after being created the feed item cannot be changed.

In multi currency organizations a feed item can have an extra currency code field. This field can give the currency code for the currency value in this field. In one aspect the value is undefined when the data type is anything other than currency.

In some implementations a comment exists as an item that depends from feed tracked updates posts status updates and other items that are independent of each other. Thus a feed comment object can exist as a child object of a feed item object. For example comment table can be considered a child table of event hifeed tracked update table . In one implementation a feed comment can be a child of a profile feed news feed or entity feed that is separate from other feed items.

In various implementations a feed comment can have various permissions for the following actions. For read permission a feed comment can be visible if the parent feed is visible. For create permission if a user has access to the feed which can be tracked by the ID of the parent feed the user can add a comment. For delete only a user with modify all data permission or a user who added the comment can delete the comment. Also delete permission can require access on the parent feed. An update of a comment can be restricted and thus not be allowed. In one implementation regarding a query restriction a feed comment cannot be queried directly but can be queried only via the parent feed. An example is select id parentid select . . . from feedcomment from entityfeed . In another implementation a feed comment can be directly queries e.g. by querying comment table . A query could include the text of a comment or any other column of the table.

In another implementation regarding soft delete behavior a feed comment table does not have a soft delete column. A soft delete allows an undelete action. In one implementation a record can have a soft delete. Thus when the record is deleted the feed and its children can be soft deleted. Therefore in one aspect a feed comment cannot be retrieved via the query verb which would retrieve only the comment but can be retrieved via queryAll verb though. An example is queryAll select id select id commentbody from feedcomments from accountfeed where parentid 001x000xxx3MkADAA0 where 001x000xxx3MkADAA0 has been soft deleted. When a hard delete a physical delete happens the comment can be hard deleted from the database.

In one implementation regarding an implicit delete feeds with comments are not deleted by a reaper a routine that performs deletion . In another implementation a user cannot delete a feed. In yet another implementation upon lead convert e.g. to an opportunity or contact the feed items of the lead can be hard deleted. This implementation can be configured to perform such a deletion for any change in record type. In various implementations only the comments are hard deleted upon a lead convert other convert or when the object is deleted as mentioned above .

In one implementation viewing a feed pulls up the most recent messages or feed tracked updates e.g. 25 and searches the most recent e.g. 4 comments for each feed item. The comments can be identified via the comment table . In one implementation a user can request to see more comments e.g. by selecting a see more link.

In some implementations user feeds and or entity feeds have a last comment date field. In various implementations the last comment date field is stored as a field of a record or a user profile. For feeds with no comments this can be the same as the created date. Whenever a new comment is created the associated feed s last comment date can be updated with the created date of the comment. The last comment date is unchanged if a feed comment is deleted. A use case is to allow people to order their queries to see the feeds which have been most recently commented on.

In some implementations a tenant e.g. through an administrator or a specific user of a tenant can specify the types of events for which feed items are created. A user can add more events or remove events from a list of events that get added to the event hifeed tracked update table . In one implementation a trigger can be added as a piece of code rule or item on a list for adding a custom event to the event hifeed tracked update table . These custom events can provide customers the ability to create their own custom feeds and custom feed items to augment or replace implicitly generated feeds via event hifeed tracked update table . Implicitly generated feed data can be created when feed tracking is enabled for certain entities field names. In one implementation in order to override implicit feeds feed tracking can be turned off and then triggers can be defined by the user to add events to the event hifeed tracked update table . In other implementations users are not allowed to override the default list of events that are added to table and thus cannot define their own triggers for having events tracked.

For example upon lead convert or case close a default action to be taken by the system may be to add multiple events to event hifeed tracked update table . If a customer e.g. a tenant or a specific user does not want each of these events to show up as feed items the customer can turn off tracking for the entities and generate custom feeds by defining customized triggers e.g. by using an API upon the events. As another example although data is not changed a customer may still want to track an action on a record e.g. status changes if not already being tracked views by certain people retrieval of data etc. .

In one implementation if a user does not want a feed item to be generated upon every change on a given field but only if the change exceeds a certain threshold or range then such custom feeds can be conditionally generated with the customized triggers. In one implementation the default tracking for the record or user may be turned off for this customization so that the events are only conditionally tracked. In another implementation a trigger can be defined that deletes events that are not desired so that default tracking can still be turned on for a particular object type. Such conditional tracking can be used for other events as well.

In some implementations defining triggers to track certain events can be done as follows. A user can define an object type to track. This object type can be added to a list of objects that can be tracked for a particular tenant. The tenant can remove object types from this list as well. Custom data structures and standard objects can be on the list which may for example be stored in cache or RAM of a server or in the database. Generally only one such list exists for a tenant and users do not have individual lists for themselves although in some implementations they may particularly when the number of users in a tenant is small.

In one implementation a tenant can select which records of an object type are to be tracked. In another implementation once an object type is added to the tracking list of object types then all records of that type are tracked. The tenant can then specify the particulars of how the tracking is to be performed. For example the tenant can specify triggers as described above fields to be tracked or any of the customizations mentioned herein.

In some implementations when a feed is defined as an object in the database e.g. as a child object of entity records that can be tracked a particular instance of the feed object e.g. for a particular record can be create able and delete able. In one implementation if a user has access to a record then the user can customize the feed for the record. In one implementation a record may be locked to prevent customization of its feed.

One method of creating a custom feed for users of a database system according to implementations is now described. Any of the following blocks can be performed wholly or partially with the database system and in particular by one or more processor of the database system.

In block A one or more criteria specifying which events are to be tracked for possible inclusion into a feed to be displayed are received from a tenant. In block B data indicative of an event is received. In block C the event is analyzed to determine if the criteria are satisfied. In block D if the criteria are satisfied at least a portion of the data is added to a table e.g. one or more of the tables in that tracks events for inclusion into at least one feed for a user of the tenant. The feed in which feed items of an event may ultimately be displayed can be a news feed record feed or a profile feed.

After feed items have been generated they can be filtered so that only certain feed items are displayed which may be tailored to a specific tenant and or user. In one implementation a user can specify changes to a field that meet certain criteria for the feed item to show up in a feed displayed to the user e.g. a news feed or even an entity feed displayed directly to the user. In one implementation the criteria can be combined with other factors e.g. number of feed items in the feed to determine which feed items to display. For instance if a small number of feed items exist e.g. below a threshold then all of the feed items may be displayed.

In one implementation a user can specify the criteria via a query on the feed items in his her new feed and thus a feed may only return objects of a certain type certain types of events feed tracked updates about certain fields and other criteria mentioned herein. Messages can also be filtered according to some criteria which may be specified in a query. Such an added query can be added onto a standard query that is used to create the news feed for a user. A first user could specify the users and records that the first user is following in this manner as well as identify the specific feed items that the first user wants to follow. The query could be created through a graphical interface or added by a user directly in a query language. Other criteria could include receiving only posts directed to a particular user or record as opposed to other feed items.

In one implementation the filters can be run by defining code triggers which run when an event specific or otherwise occurs. The trigger could then run to perform the filtering at the time the event occurs or when a user who has certain defined triggers that is configured for a particular user requests a display of the feed. A trigger could search for certain terms e.g. vulgar language and then remove such terms or not create the feed item. A trigger can also be used to send the feed item to a particular person e.g. an administrator who does not normally receive the feed item were it not for the feed item containing the flagged terms.

In one implementation a user can access a feed of a record if the user can access the record. The security rules for determining whether a user has access to a record can be performed in a variety of ways some of which are described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 8 095 531 titled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR CONTROLLING ACCESS TO CUSTOM OBJECTS IN A DATABASE by Weissman et al. issued on Jan. 10 2012 and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. For example a security level table can specify whether a user can see a particular type of record and or particular records. In one implementation a hierarchy of positions within a tenant is used. For example a manager can inherit the access levels of employees that the manager supervises. Field level security FLS can also be used to determine whether a particular feed tracked update about an update to a field can be seen by the user. The field change table can be used to identify a field name or field ID and then whether the user has read access to that field can be determined from an FLS table. For example if a user could not see a field of a social security number the feed of the user provided to the user would not include any feed items related to the social security number field.

In one implementation a user can edit a feed of a record if the user has access to the record e.g. deleting or editing a feed item. In another implementation a user besides an administrator cannot edit a feed item except for performing an action from which a feed item can be created. In one implementation a user is required to have access to a particular record and field for a feed item to be created based on an action of the user. In this case an administrator can be considered to be a user with MODIFY ALL DATA security level. In yet another implementation a user who created the record can edit the feed.

In one implementation the text of posts are stored in a child table post table which can be cross referenced with event hifeed tracked update table . Post table can include event ID to cross reference with event ID post text to store the text of the post and time date . An entry in post table can be considered a feed post object. Posts for a record can also be subject to access checks. In one implementation if a user can view a record then all of the posts can be seen i.e. there is not an additional level of security check as there is for FLS. In another implementation an additional security check could be done e.g. by checking on whether certain keywords or phrases exist in the post. For instance a post may not be not provided to specified users if a certain keyword exists or only provided to specified users if a keyword exists. In another implementation a table can exist for status updates.

As described above a user can follow users groups and records. Implementations can provide mechanisms for a user to manage which users groups and records that the user is currently following. In one implementation a user can be limited to the number of users and records collectively or separately that the user can follow. For example a user may be restricted to only following 10 users and 15 records or as another example 25 total. Alternatively the user may be permitted to follow more or less users.

In one implementation a user can go to a page of a record and then select to follow that object e.g. with a button marked follow or join . In another implementation a user can search for a record and have the matching records show up in a list. The search can include criteria of records that the user might want to follow. Such criteria can include the owner the creation date last comment date and numerical values of particular fields e.g. an opportunity with a value of more than 10 000 .

A follow button or other activation object can then reside next to each record in the resulting list and the follow button can be selected to start following the record. Similarly a user can go to a profile page of a user and select to follow the user or a search for users can provide a list where one or more users can be selected for following from the list. The selections of subscribing and unsubscribing can add and delete rows in table .

In some implementations a subscription center acts as a centralized place in a database application e.g. application platform to manage which records a user subscribes to and which field updates the user wants to see in feed tracked updates. The subscription center can use a subscription table to keep track of the subscriptions of various users. In one implementation the subscription center shows a list of all the items users and records a user is subscribed to. In another implementation a user can unsubscribe to subscribed objects from the subscription center.

In one implementation an automatic subscription feature can ensure that a user is receiving certain feeds. In this manner a user does not have to actively select certain objects to follow. Also a tenant can ensure that a user is following objects that the user needs to be following.

In various implementations for automatically following users a default for small organizations can be to follow everyone. For big organizations the default can be to follow a manager and peers. If a user is a manager the default can be to follow the manager s supervisor peers and people that the manager supervises subordinates . In other implementations for automatically following records records that the user owns may be automatically followed and or records recently viewed or changed may be automatically followed.

In one example a new record is created. The owner not necessarily the user who created the entity is subscribed to the entity. If ownership is changed the new owner may automatically be subscribed to follow the entity. Also after a lead convert the user doing the lead convert may be automatically subscribed to the new account opportunity or contact resulting from the lead convert. In one implementation the auto subscription is controlled by user preference. That is a user or tenant can have the auto subscribe feature enabled or not. In one aspect the default is to have the auto subscribe turned on.

In block one or more properties of an object stored in the database system are received. The properties can be received from administrators of the database system or from users of the database system which may be an administrator of a customer organization . The properties can be records or users and can include any of the fields of the object that are stored in the database system. Examples of properties of a record include an owner of the record a user that converted the record from one record type to another record type whether the first user has viewed the record and a time the first user viewed the record. Examples of properties of a user include which organization tenant the user is associated with the second user s position in the same organization and which other users the user had e mailed or worked with on projects.

In block the database system receives one or more criteria about which users are to automatically follow the object. The criteria can be received from administrators of the database system or from one or more users of the database system. The users may be an administrator of a customer organization which can set tenant wide criteria or criteria for specific users who may also set the criteria themselves . Examples of the criteria can include an owner or creator of a record is to follow the record subordinates of an owner or creator of a record are to follow the record a user is to follow records recently viewed potentially after a specific number of views records that a user has changed values potentially with a date requirement records created by others in a same business group as the user. Examples of the criteria can also include a user is to follow his her manager the user s peers other users in the same business group as the user and other users that the user has e mailed or worked with on a project. The criteria can be specific to a user or group of users e.g. users of a tenant .

In block the database system determines whether the one or more properties of the object satisfy the one or more criteria for a first user. In one implementation this determination can occur by first obtaining the criteria and then determining objects that satisfy the criteria. The determination can occur periodically at time of creation of an object or at other times. If different users have different criteria then the criteria for a particular user or group could be searched at the same time. Since users of different tenants normally cannot view objects of another tenant certain criteria does not have to be checked. In another implementation this determination can occur by looking at certain properties and then identifying any criteria that are met. In yet another implementation the criteria and properties can be used to find users that satisfy the criteria.

In block if the criteria are satisfied the object is associated with the first user. The association can be in a list that stores information as to what objects are being followed by the first user. User subscription table is an example of such a list. In one implementation the one or more criteria are satisfied if one property satisfies at least one criterion. Thus if the criteria are that a user follows his her manager and the object is the user s manager then the first user will follow the object.

In one implementation a user can also be automatically unsubscribed e.g. if a certain action happens. The action could be a change in the user s position within the organization e.g. a demotion or becoming a contractor. As another example if a case gets closed then users following the case may be automatically unsubscribed.

In one implementation a feed and subscription center API can enable tenants to provide mechanisms for tracking and creating feed items e.g. as described above for creating custom feeds by allowing users to add custom events for tracking. For example after some initial feed items are created e.g. by administrators of the database system outside groups e.g. tenants or software providers selling software to the tenants can enable objects for feeds through a standard API. The groups can then integrate into the subscription center and the feed tracked update feeds on their own. In one implementation the feed and subscription center API can use a graphical user interface implemented for the default feed tracking. In one implementation API examples include subscribing to an entity by creating a new entity subscription object for a particular user ID or for all users of a tenant e.g. user subscription table . In one implementation obtaining all subscriptions for a given user can be performed by using a query such as select . . . from EntitySubscription where userid . . . .

Some implementations have restriction on non admin users e.g. those without view all data permissions VAD . One restriction can be a limit clause on entity subscription queries e.g. queries on user subscription table e.g. where the limit of the number of operations is less than 100. In one implementation users are not required to specify an order by but if an order by is specified they can only order on fields on the entity subscription entity. In one implementation filters on entity subscription can likewise only specify fields on the entity subscription entity. In one aspect the object ID being followed can be sorted or filtered but not the object name.

In one implementation one or more restrictions can also be placed on the identification of feed items in a feed that a user can access. For example if a low level user i.e. user can access few objects is attempting to see a profile feed of a high level user a maximum number of checks e.g. 500 for access rights may be allowed. Such a restriction can minimize a cost of a feed request. In some implementations there are restriction on the type of queries e.g. fields for filtering allowed to construct on feeds e.g. on tables in .

As mentioned above users may be restricted from seeing records from other tenants as well as certain records from the tenant to which the user belongs e.g. the user s employer . Sharing rules can refer to the access rules that restrict a user from seeing records that the user is not authorized to see or access. Additionally in one implementation a user may be restricted to only seeing certain fields of a record field level security FLS .

In an implementation access rule checks are done upon subscription. For example a user is not allowed to subscribe to a record or type of record that the user cannot access. In one aspect this can minimize but not necessarily eliminate cases where a user subscribes to entities they cannot access. Such cases can slow down news feed queries when an access check is performed which can end up removing much of the feed items . Thus a minimization of access checks can speed up operation. In another implementation when feed items are created dynamically access rule checks may be done dynamically at the time of subsequent access and not upon subscription or in addition to at time of subscription.

An example case where access checks are still performed is when a first user follows a second user but the second user performs some actions on records or is following records that the first user is not allowed to see. The first user may be allowed to follow the second user and thus the subscription is valid even though the first user may not be able to see all of the feed items. Before a feed tracked update is provided to a news feed of the first user a security check may be performed to validate whether the first user has access rights to the feed item. If not the feed item is not displayed to the first user. In one implementation users can be blocked from feed items that contain certain terms symbols account numbers etc. In one implementation any user can follow another user. In another implementation users may be restricted as to which users objects and or records he she can follow.

Regarding viewing privileges of a feed in one implementation a user can always see all of his own subscriptions even if he s lost read access to a record . For example a user can become a contractor and then the user may lose access to some records. But the user may still see that he she is following the object. This can help if there is a limit to the number of objects that can be followed. To unsubscribe a user may need to know what they are following so they can unsubscribe and subscribe to objects the user can see. In another implementation for access to other people s subscriptions a user can be required to need read access on the record id to see the subscription. In some implementations users with authorization to modify all data can create delete any subscription. In other implementations a user can create delete subscriptions only for that user and not anyone else.

There can be various feed settings for which feed items get added to profile and record feeds and which get added to news feeds. In one implementation for profile feeds and entity feeds feed tracked updates can be written for all standard and custom fields on the supported objects. In one implementation feed settings can be set to limit how many and which fields of a record are tracked for determining whether a feed tracked update is to be generated. For example a user or administrator can choose specific fields to track and or certain ones not to track. In another implementation there is a separate limit for the number of trackable fields e.g. 20 for a record. Thus only certain changes may be tracked in an entity hifeed tracked update and show up in the feed. In yet another implementation default fields may be chosen for tracking where the defaults can be exposed in the subscriptions center.

As described above a feed includes feed items which include feed tracked updates and messages as defined herein. Various feeds can be generated. For example a feed can be generated about a record or about a user. Then users can view these feeds. A user can separately view a feed of a record or user e.g. by going to a home page for the user or the record. As described above a user can also follow another user or record and receive the feed items of those feeds through a separate feed application e.g. in a page or window which is termed chatter in certain examples. The feed application can provide each of the feeds that a user is following and in some examples can combine various feeds in a single information feed.

A feed generator can refer to any software program running on a processor or a dedicated processor or combination thereof that can generate feed items e.g. feed tracked updates or messages and combine them into a feed. In one implementation the feed generator can generate a feed item by receiving a feed tracked update or message identifying what feeds the item should be added to and adding the feed. Adding the feed can include adding additional information metadata to the feed tracked update or message e.g. adding a document sender of message a determined importance etc. . The feed generator can also check to make sure that no one sees feed tracked updates for data that they don t have access to see e.g. according to sharing rules . A feed generator can run at various times to pre compute feeds or to compute them dynamically or combinations thereof.

In one implementation the feed generator can de dupe events i.e. prevent duplicates that may come in from numerous records and users . For example since a feed tracked update can be published to multiple feeds e.g. John Choe changed the Starbucks Account Status and a person can be subscribed to both the Starbucks account and John Choe implementations can filter out duplicates before adding or displaying the items in a news feed. Thus the Feed Generator can collapse events with multiple records and users for a single transaction into a single feed tracked update and ensure the right number of feed tracked updates for the particular feed. In some implementations an action by a user does not create a feed item for that user e.g. for a profile feed of that user and it is only the feed of the object being acted upon e.g. updated for which a feed item is created. Thus there should not be duplicates. For example if someone updates the status of a record the feed item is only for the record and not the user.

In one implementation processor in can identify an event that meets criteria for a feed tracked update and then generate the feed tracked update. Processor can also identify a message. For example an application interface can have certain mechanisms for submitting a message e.g. submit buttons on a profile page detail page of a record comment button on post and use of these mechanisms can be used to identify a message to be added to a table used to create a feed or added directly to a list of feed items ready for display.

In some implementations a feed of feed items is created before a user requests the feed. Such an implementation can run fast but have high overall costs for storage. In one implementation once a profile feed or a record feed has been created a feed item messages and feed tracked updates can be added to the feed. The feed can exist in the database system in a variety of ways such as a related list. The feed can include mechanisms to remove items as well as add them.

As described above a news feed can be an aggregated feed of all the record feeds and profile feeds to which a user has subscribed. The news feed can be provided on the home page of the subscribing user. Therefore a news feed can be created by and exist for a particular user. For example a user can subscribe to receive entity feeds of certain records that are of interest to the user and to receive profile feeds of people that are of interest e.g. people on a same team that work for the user are a boss of the user etc. . A news feed can tell a user about all the actions across all the records and people whom have explicitly or implicitly been subscribed to via the subscriptions center described above .

In one implementation only one instance of each feed tracked update is shown on a user s news feed even if the feed tracked update is published in multiple entities to which the user is subscribed. In one aspect there may be delays in publishing news articles. For example the delay may be due to queued up messages for asynchronous entity hifeed tracked update persistence. Different feeds may have different delays e.g. delay for new feeds but none of profile and entity feeds . In another implementation certain feed tracked updates regarding a subscribed profile feed or an entity feed are not shown because the user is not allowed access e.g. due to sharing rules which restrict which users can see which data . Also in one implementation data of the record that has been updated which includes creation can be provided in the feed e.g. a file or updated value of a feed can be added as a flash rendition .

Examples are provided below as how it can be determined which feed items to add to which news feeds. In one implementation the addition of items to a news feed is driven by the following user. For example the user s profile can be checked to determine objects the user is following and the database may be queried to determine updates to these objects. In another implementation the users and records being followed drive the addition of items to a news feed. Implementations can also combine these and other aspects. In one implementation a database system can be follower driven if the number of subscriptions users and records the user is following is small. For example since the number subscriptions are small then changes to a small number of objects need to be checked for the follower.

Regarding implementations that are follower driven one implementation can have a routine run for a particular user. The routine knows the users and records that the user is following. The routine can poll the database system for new feed tracked updates and messages about the users and records that are being followed. In one implementation the polling can be implemented as queries. In one implementation the routine can run at least partially even wholly on a user device.

Regarding implementations where a news feed is driven by the record or user being followed processor can identify followers of the record after a feed item is added to the record feed. Processor can retrieve a list of the followers from the database system. The list can be associated with the record and can be stored as a related list or other object that is a field or child of the record.

In one implementation profile and record feeds can be updated immediately with a new feed item after an action is taken or an event occurs. A news feed can also be updated immediately. In another implementation a news feed can be updated in batch jobs which can run at periodic times.

In some implementations a feed generator can generate the feed items dynamically when a user requests to see a particular feed e.g. a profile feed entity feed or the user s news feed. In one implementation the most recent feed items e.g. top 50 are generated first. In one aspect the other feed items can be generated as a background process e.g. not synchronously with the request to view the feed. However since the background process is likely to complete before a user gets to the next 50 feed items the feed generation may appear synchronous. In another aspect the most recent feed items may or may not include comments e.g. that are tied to feed tracked updates or posts.

In one implementation the feed generator can query the appropriate subset of tables shown in and or other tables as necessary to generate the feed items for display. For example the feed generator can query the event hifeed tracked update table for the updates that occurred for a particular record. The ID of the particular record can be matched against the ID of the record. In one implementation changes to a whole set of records can be stored in one table. The feed generator can also query for status updates posts and comments each of which can be stored in different parts of a record or in separate tables as shown in . What gets recorded in the entity hifeed tracked update table as well as what is displayed can be controlled by a feed settings page in setup which can be configurable by an administrator and can be the same for the entire organization as is described above for custom feeds.

In one implementation there can be two feed generators. For example one generator can generate the record and profile feeds and another generator can generate news feeds. For the former the feed generator can query identifiers of the record or the user profile. For the latter the news feed generator can query the subscribed profile feeds and record feeds e.g. user subscription table . In one implementation the feed generator looks at a person s subscription center to decide which feeds to query for and return a list of feed items for the user. The list can be de duped e.g. by looking at the event number and values for the respective table such as field name or ID comment ID or other information.

In block data indicative of an event is received. The data may have a particular identifier that specifies the event. For example there may be a particular identifier for a field update. In another implementation the transaction may be investigated for keywords identifying the event e.g. terms in a query indicating a close change field or create operations .

In block it is determined whether the event is being tracked for inclusion into feed tables. The determination of what is being tracked can be based on a tenant s configuration as described above. In one aspect the event has an actor person performing an event and an object of the event e.g. record or user profile being changed .

In block the event is written to an event hifeed tracked update table e.g. table . In one implementation this feed tracking operation can be performed in the same transaction that performs a save operation for updating a record. In another implementation a transaction includes at least two roundtrip database operations with one roundtrip being the database save write and the second database operation being the saving of the update in the hifeed tracked update table. In one implementation the event hifeed tracked update table is chronological. In another implementation if user A posts on user B s profile then user A is under the created by and user B is under the object ID .

In block a field change table e.g. field change table can be updated with an entry having the event identifier and fields that were changed in the update. In one implementation the field change table is a child table of the event hifeed tracked update table. This table can include information about each of the fields that are changed. For example for an event that changes the name and balance for an account record an entry can have the event identifier the old and new name and the old and new balance. Alternatively each field change can be in a different row with the same event identifier. The field name or ID can also be included to determine which field the values are associated.

In block when the event is a post a post table e.g. post table can be updated with an entry having the event identifier and text of the post. In one implementation the field change table is a child table of the event hifeed tracked update table. In another implementation the text can be identified in the transaction e.g. a query command stripped out and put into the entry at the appropriate column. The various tables described herein can be combined or separated in various ways. For example the post table and the field change table may be part of the same table or distinct tables or may include overlapping portions of data.

In block a comment is received for an event and the comment is added to a comment table e.g. comment table . The comment could be for a post or an update of a record from which a feed tracked update can be generated for display. In one implementation the text can be identified in the transaction e.g. a query command stripped out and put into the entry at the appropriate column.

In block a query is received for an events history table e.g. event hifeed tracked update table for events related to a particular record. In one implementation the query includes an identifier of the record for which the feed is being requested. In various implementations the query may be initiated from a detail page of the record a home page of a user requesting the record feed or from a listing of different records e.g. obtained from a search or from browsing .

In block the user s security level can be checked to determine if the user can view the record feed. Typically a user can view a record feed if the user can access the record. This security check can be performed in various ways. In one implementation a first table is checked to see if the user has a classification e.g. a security level that allows him to view records of the given type . In another implementation a second table is checked to see if the user is allowed to see the specific record. The first table can be checked before the second table and both tables can be different sections of a same table. If the user has requested the feed from the detail page of the record one implementation can skip the security level check for the record since the check was already done when the user requested to view the detail page.

In one implementation a security check is determined upon each request to view the record feed. Thus whether or not a feed item is displayed to a user is determined based on access rights e.g. when the user requests to see a feed of a record or a news feed of all the objects the user is following. In this manner if a user s security changes a feed automatically adapts to the user s security level when it is changed. In another implementation a feed can be computed before being requested and a subsequent security check can be made to determine whether the person still has access right to view the feed items. The security access check may be at the field level as well as at the record level.

In block if the user can access the record a field level security table can be checked to determine whether the user can see particular fields. In one implementation only those fields are displayed to the user. Alternatively a subset of those the user has access to is displayed. The field level security check may optionally be performed at the same time and even using the same operation as the record level check. In addition the record type check may also be performed at this time. If the user can only see certain fields then any feed items related to those fields e.g. as determined from field change table can be removed from the feed being displayed.

In block the feed items that the user has access to are displayed. In one implementation a predetermined number e.g. 20 of feed items are displayed at a time. The method can display the first 20 feed items that are found to be readable and then determine others while the user is viewing the first 20. In another implementation the other feed items are not determined until the user requests to see them e.g. by activating a see more link.

In block a query is directed to an event hifeed tracked update table e.g. event hifeed tracked update table for events having a first user as the actor of the event e.g. creation of an account or on which the event occurred e.g. a post to the user s profile . In various implementations the query may be initiated by a second user from the user s profile page a home page of a user requesting the profile feed e.g. from a list of users being followed or from a listing of different users e.g. obtained from a search or from browsing . Various mechanisms for determining aspects of events and obtaining information from tables can be the same across any of the methods described herein.

In block a security check may also be performed on whether the second user can see the first user s profile. In one implementation any user can see the profile of another user of the same tenant and block is optional.

In block a security access check can be performed for the feed tracked updates based on record types records and or fields as well security checks for messages. In one implementation only the feed tracked updates related to records that the person has updated are the ones that need security check as the feed items about the user are readable by any user of the same tenant. Users of other tenants are not navigable and thus security can be enforced at a tenant level. In another implementation messages can be checked for keywords or links to a record or field that the second user does not have access.

As users can have different security classifications it is important that a user with a low level security cannot see changes to records that have been performed by a user with high level security. In one implementation each feed item can be checked and then the viewable results displayed but this can be inefficient. For example such a security check may take a long time and the second user would like to get some results sooner rather than later. The following blocks illustrate one implementation of how security might be checked for a first user that has a lot of feed items but the second user cannot see most of them. This implementation can be used for all situations but can be effective in the above situation.

In block a designated number of entries are retrieved from the event hifeed tracked update table e.g. starting from the most recent which may be determined from the event identifier . The retrieved entries may just be ones that match the user ID of the query. In one implementation entries are checked to find the entries that are associated with the user and with a record i.e. not just posts to the user account . In another implementation those entries associated with the user are allowed to be viewed e.g. because the second user can see the profile of the first user as determined in block .

In block the record identifiers are organized by type and the type is checked on whether the second user can see the record types. Other checks such as whether a record was manually shared e.g. by the owner can also be performed. In one implementation the queries for the different types can be done in parallel.

In block if a user can see the record type then a check can be performed on the specific record. In one implementation if a user can see a record type then the user can see all of the records of that type and so this block can be skipped. In another implementation the sharing model can account for whether a user below the second user e.g. the second user is a manager can see the record. In such an implementation the second user may see such a record. In one implementation if a user cannot see a specific record then comments on that record are also not viewable.

In block field level sharing rules can be used to determine whether the second user can see information about an update or value of certain fields. In one implementation messages can be analyzed to determine if reference to a particular field name is made. If so then field level security can be applied to the messages.

In block blocks are repeated until a stopping criterion is met. In one implementation the stopping criteria may be when a maximum number e.g. 100 of entries that are viewable have been identified. In another implementation the stopping criteria can be that a maximum number e.g. 500 of entries from the entity hifeed tracked update table have been analyzed regardless of whether the entries are viewable or not.

In one implementation a news feed can be generated as a combination of the profile feeds and the entity feeds e.g. as described above. In one implementation a list of records and user profiles for the queries in blocks and can be obtained form user subscription table . In one implementation there is a maximum number of objects that can be followed.

In various implementations the entity hifeed tracked update table can be queried for any one or more of the following matching variables as part of determining items for a feed CreatedDate CreatedById CreatedBy.FirstName CreatedBy.LastName ParentId and Parent.Name. The child tables can also be queried for any one or more of the following matching variables as part of determining items for a feed DataType FieldName OldValue and NewValue. A query can also specify how the resulting feed items can be sorted for display e.g. by event number date importance etc. The query can also include a number of items to be returned which can be enforced at the server.

The two examples provided above can be done periodically to create the feeds ahead of time or done dynamically at the time the display of a feed is requested. Such a dynamic calculation can be computationally intensive for a news feed particularly if many users and records are being followed although there can be a low demand for storage. Accordingly one implementation performs some calculations ahead of time and stores the results in order to create a news feed.

In block data indicative of an event is received. The data may be the same and identified in the same way as described for block . The event may be written to an event hifeed tracked update table e.g. table .

In block the object s associated with the event are identified. In various implementations the object may be identified by according to various criteria such as the record being changed the user changing the record a user posting a message and a user whose profile the message is being posted to.

In block the users following the event are determined. In one implementation one or more objects that are associated with the event are used to determine the users following the event. In one implementation a subscription table e.g. table can be used to find the identified objects. The entries of the identified objects can contain an identifier e.g. user ID of each the users following the object

In block the event and the source of the event e.g. a record for a record update or a posting user for a user generated post are written to a news feed table along with an event identifier. In one implementation such information is added as a separate entry into the news feed table along with the event ID. In another implementation each of the events for a user is added as a new column for the row of the user. In yet another implementation more columns e.g. columns from the other tables can be added.

News feed table shows an example of such a table with user ID and event ID or pointer . The table can be organized in any manner. One difference from event hifeed tracked update table is that one event can have multiple entries one for each subscriber in the news feed table . In one implementation all of the entries for a same user are grouped together e.g. as shown. The user U is shown as following events E and E and thus any of the individual feed items resulting from those events. In another implementation any new entries are added at the end of the table. Thus all of the followers for a new event can be added as a group. In such an implementation the event IDs would generally be grouped together in the table. Of course the table can be sorted in any suitable manner.

In an implementation if the number of users is small then the feed items in one or more of the tables may be written as part of the same write transaction. In one implementation the determination of small depends on the number of updates performed for the event e.g. a maximum number of update operations may be allowed and if more operations are performed then the addition of the feed items is performed. In one aspect the number of operations can be counted by the number of rows to be updated including the rows of the record which depends on the update event and the rows of the hifeed tracked update tables which can depend on the number of followers. In another implementation if the number of users is large the rest of the feed items can be created by batch. In one implementation the feed items are always written as part of a different transaction i.e. by batch job.

In one implementation security checks can be performed before an entry is added to the news feed table . In this manner security checks can be performed during batch jobs and may not have to be performed at the time of requesting a news feed. In one implementation the event can be analyzed and if access is not allowed to a feed item of the event then an entry is not added. In one aspect multiple feed items for a same user may not result from a same event e.g. by how an event is defined in table and thus there is no concern about a user missing a feed item that he she should be able to view.

In block a request for a news feed is received from a user. In one implementation the request is obtained when a user navigates to the user s home page. In another implementation the user selects a table link or other page item that causes the request to be sent.

In block the news feed table and other tables are accessed to provide displayable feed items of the news feed. The news feed can then be displayed. In one implementation the news feed table can then be joined with the event hifeed tracked update table to determine the feed items. For example the news feed table can be searched for entries with a particular user ID. These entries can be used to identify event entries in event hifeed tracked update table and the proper information from any child tables can be retrieved. The feed items e.g. feed tracked updates and messages can then be generated for display.

In one implementation the most recent feed items e.g. 100 most recent are determined first. The other feed items may then be determined in a batch process. Thus the feed item that a user is most likely to view can come up first and the user may not recognize that the other feed items are being done in batch. In one implementation the most recent feed items can be gauged by the event identifiers. In another implementation the feed items with a highest importance level can be displayed first. The highest importance being determined by one or more criteria such as who posted the feed item how recently how related to other feed items etc.

In one implementation where the user subscription table is used to dynamically create a news feed the query would search the subscription table and then use the object IDs to search the event hifeed tracked update table one search for each object the user is following . Thus the query for the news feed can be proportional to the number of objects that one was subscribing to. The news feed table allows the intermediate block of determining the object IDs to be done at an earlier stage so that the relevant events are already known. Thus the determination of the feed is no longer proportional to the number of object being followed.

In some implementations a news feed table can include a pointer as opposed to an event identifier to the event hifeed tracked update table for each event that is being followed by the user. In this manner the event entries can immediately be retrieved without having to perform a search on the event hifeed tracked update table. Security checks can be made at this time and the text for the feed tracked updates can be generated.

Feeds include messages and feed tracked updates and can show up in many places in an application interface with the database system. In one implementation feeds can be scoped to the context of the page on which they are being displayed. For example how a feed tracked update is presented can vary depending on which page it is being displayed e.g. in news feeds on a detail page of a record and even based on how the user ended up at a particular page . In another implementation only a finite number of feed items are displayed e.g. 50 . In one implementation there can be a limit specifically on the number of feed tracked updates or messages displayed. Alternatively the limit can be applied to particular types of feed tracked updates or messages. For example only the most recent changes e.g. 5 most recent for a field may be displayed. Also the number of fields for which changes are displayed can also be limited. Such limits can also be placed on profile feeds and news feeds. In one implementation feed items may also be subject to certain filtering criteria before being displayed e.g. as described below.

As mentioned above a user may not be allowed to see all of the records in the database and not even all of the records of the organization to which the user belongs. A user can also be restricted from viewing certain fields of a record that the user is otherwise authorized to view. Accordingly certain implementations use access rules also called sharing rules and field level security FLS to ensure that a user does not view a feed tracked update or message that the user is not authorized to see. A feed of a record can be subject to the same access rules as the parent record.

In one implementation access rules can be used to prevent subscription to a record that the user cannot see. In one implementation a user can see a record but only some of the fields. In such instances only items about fields that the user can access may be displayed. In another implementation sharing rules and FLS are applied before a feed item is being added to a feed. In another implementation sharing rules and FLS are applied after a feed item has been added and when the feed is being displayed. When a restriction of display is mentioned the enforcement of access rules may occur at any stage before display.

In some implementations the access rules can be enforced when a query is provided to a record or a user s profile to obtain feed items for a news feed of a user. The access rules can be checked and cross references with the feed items that are in the feed. Then the query can only return feed items for which the user has access.

In other implementations the access rules can be enforced when a user selects a specific profile feed or record feed. For example when a user arrives on a home page or selects a tab to see the record feed the database system can check to see which feed items the user can see. In such an implementation each feed item can be associated with metadata that identifies which field the feed item is about. Thus in one implementation a feed tracked update is not visible unless the associated record and or field are visible to the user.

In one example when a user accesses a feed of a record an access check can be performed to identify whether the user can access the object type of the record. In one implementation users are assigned a profile type and the profile type is cross referenced e.g. by checking a table to determine whether the profile type of the user can see the object type of the record.

In some implementations access to specific records can be checked e.g. after it has been determined that the user can access the record type. Rules can be used to determine the records viewable by a user. Such rules can determine the viewable records as a combination of those viewable by profile type viewable due to a profile hierarchy e.g. a boss can view records of profile types lower in the hierarchy and viewable by manual sharing e.g. as may be done by an owner of a record . In one implementation the records viewable by a user can be determined beforehand and stored in a table. In one implementation the table can be cross referenced by user or profile type of a user to provide a list of the records that the user can see and the list can be searched to determine if the record at issue is among the list. In another implementation the table can be cross referenced by record to determine a list of the profile types that can access the record and the list can be searched to find out if the requesting user is in the list. In another implementation the records viewable by a user can be determined dynamically at the time of the access check e.g. by applying rules to data such as user profile and hierarchy information obtained from querying one or more tables.

In other implementations checks can be made as to whether a user has access to certain fields of a record e.g. after it has been determined that the user can access the record. In one aspect the access check on fields can be performed on results already obtained from the database to filter out fields that the user cannot see. In one implementation the fields associated with retrieved feed items are determined and these fields are cross referenced with an access table that contains the fields accessible by the user e.g. using the profile type of the user . Such an access table could also be a negative access table by specifying fields that the user cannot see as can other access tables mentioned herein. In one implementation the field level access table is stored in cache at a server.

In one implementation a user can see the same fields across all records of a certain type e.g. as long as the user can see the record . In one implementation there is a field level access table for each object type. The access table can be cross referenced by user e.g. via profile type or field. For example a field can be identified along with the profile types that can see the field and it can be determined whether the user s profile type is listed. In another example the user can be found and the fields to which the user has access can be obtained. In another implementation the accessible fields could be specified for each record.

Regarding profile feeds and news feeds a first user may perform an action on a record and a feed tracked update may be generated and added to the first user s profile feed. A second user who is allowed to follow the first user may not have access rights to the record. Thus the feed tracked update can be excluded from a news feed of the second user or when the second user views the first user s profile feed directly. In one implementation if a user is already on the detail page then another access check at least at the record level may optionally not be performed since a check was already done in order to view the detail page.

In some implementations for profile feeds and news feeds the feed items can be organized by object type. IT can then be determined whether the requesting user can access to those object types. Other access checks can be done independently or in conjunction with these access checks as is described above.

Various implementations can implement the access rules in various ways. In one implementation all recent feed items or more generally events are retrieved from a feed that is ready for display e.g. after a feed generator performs formatting or a table. Then bulk sharing checks can be applied on the retrieved items. The viewable feed items of the most recent set can then be displayed.

In another implementation regarding a profile feed for non VAD view all data users i.e. users who can see everything certain functions can be overridden. In one implementation a FROM clause in a query can be overridden to be a pipelined function e.g. with different parts of the query being operated on at the same time but with different operations of a pipeline. This pipeline function can be given a row limit and the maximum number of sharing checks to run. It can loop selecting the next batch of rows run sharing checks against them in bulk and pipe back any IDs which are accessible. In one aspect in nearly all cases the user feed can contain accessible IDs so the sharing checks can pass on the first loop. However it is possible the sharing may have changed such that this user s access is greatly reduced. In one worst case implementations can run sharing checks on up to the maximum number of sharing check rows e.g. a default and then terminate the function with the IDs which passed so far possibly zero. Such an example includes a low level person viewing profile feed of CEO.

It can be possible that a user subscribes to many users and records which can cause a user s news feed to be very long and include many feed items. In such instances it can be difficult for the user to read every feed item and thus some important or interesting feed items may not be read. In some implementations filters may be used to determine which feed items are added to a feed or displayed in the feed even though a user may be authorized to see more than what is displayed. Section VII.E also provides a description of filtering based on criteria.

In one implementation an interestingness filter can function as a module for controlling recommending which feed tracked updates make it to the news feed when the number of items that a user subscribes to is large. In one such implementation a user can specify a filter which is applied to a user s news feed or to record and profile feeds that the user requests. Different filters can be used for each. For example processing can be done on the news feed to figure out which feed tracked updates are the most relevant to the user. One implementation can use an importance weight and level ranking as described herein. Other implementations can include a user specifying keywords for a message and specifying which records or users are most important.

In one implementation a filter can be used that only allows certain feed items to be added to a feed and or to be displayed as part of a feed. A filter can be used such that the removal or non addition of certain feed items automatically occur for any new feed items after the filter criteria are entered. The filter criteria can also be added retroactively. The criteria of such a filter can be applied via a query mechanism as part of adding a feed item to a table or displaying a feed as described in sections above. In various implementations a user can directly write a query or create the query through a graphical user interface.

In block one or more criteria specifying which feed items are to be displayed to a first user are received from a tenant. In one implementation the criteria specifies which items to add to the custom feed. For example the criteria could specify to only include feed items for certain fields of a record messages including certain keywords and other criteria mentioned herein. In another implementation the criteria specifies which items to remove from the custom feed. For example the criteria could specify not to include feed items about certain fields or including certain keywords.

In block the database system identifies feed items of one or more selected objects that match the criteria. The feed items can be stored in the database e.g. in one or more of the tables of . In one implementation the one or more selected objects are the objects that the first user is following. In another implementation the one or more selected objects is a single record whose record feed the first user is requesting.

In block the feed items that match the criteria are displayed to the first user in the custom feed. The generation of text for a feed tracked update can occur after the identification of the feed items e.g. data for a field change and before the display of the final version of the feed item.

In one implementation the criteria are received before a feed item is created. In another implementation the criteria are received from the first user. In one aspect the criteria may only used for determining feeds to display to the first user. In yet another implementation the criteria are received from a first tenant and applies to all of the users of the first tenant. Also in an implementation where a plurality of criteria are specified the criteria may be satisfied for a feed item if one criterion is satisfied.

Some implementations can provide mechanisms to search for feed items of interest. For example the feed items can be searched by keyword e.g. as entered by a user. As another example a tab or other selection device can show feed items about or from a particular user. In one implementation only messages or even just comments from a particular user can be selected.

In another implementation a user can enter search criteria so that the feed items currently displayed are searched and a new list of matching feed items is displayed. A search box can be used to enter keywords. Picklists menus or other mechanisms can be used to select search criteria. In yet another implementation feed comments are text indexed and searchable. Feed comments accessibility and visibility can apply on the search operation too.

In one implementation when a user performs a search of feeds there can be an implicit filter of the user e.g. by user ID . This can restrict the search to only the news feed of the user and thus to only record feeds and profile feeds that the user is subscribed. In another implementation searches can also be done across feeds of users and records that are not being subscribed.

Besides searching for feed items that match a criteria one also could search for a particular feed item. However in one implementation a user cannot directly query a feed item or feed comment. In such an implementation a user can query to obtain a particular profile or record feed and then navigate to the feed item e.g. as child of the parent feed . In another implementation the relationship from a feed to its parent entity e.g. a record or user profile is uni directional. That is a user can navigate from the feed to the parent but not vice versa.

In one implementation a user can directly query the child tables e.g. comment table . Thus a user could search for comments only that user has made or comments that contain certain words. In another implementation a user can search for a profile feed of only one user. In yet another implementation a user can search for profile feeds of multiple users e.g. by specifying multiple user names or IDs which can be combined into a single feed.

If every feed item is stored and maintained on a follower s feed or even in the profile and or record feeds the amount of data to be stored could be massive enough to cause storage issues in the system. In one implementation the N e.g. 50 most recent feed items for each feed are kept. However there can be a need to keep certain older feed items. Thus implementations can remove certain feed items while keeping others. In other implementations old feed tracked updates may be archived in a data store separate from where recent feed items are stored.

In some implementations feeds are purged by a routine also called a reaper that can remove items deemed not worthy to keep e.g. old items . Any underlying data structures from which feed items are created can also be purged. In one implementation the reaper can remove certain items when new items are added e.g. after every 5th item added . As another example feed items may be deleted synchronously during the save operation itself. However this may slow down each save operation. In one implementation however this may be better than incurring a larger cost when the items are removed at longer intervals. In another implementation the reaper can run periodically as a batch process. Such routines can ensure that a table size does not become too large. In one aspect a reaper routine can keep the event hifeed tracked update table relatively small so the sharing checks are not extremely expensive.

In various implementations the reaper can maintain a minimum number e.g. 50 or 100 of feed items per record maintain a minimum number of records per user e.g. per user ID and not deleting feed items or entire records which have comments against it. Such implementations can ensure that the detail page and profile page have sufficient data to display in a feed. Note that the sharing checks for feed queries can cut down the number of records further for users with less access. Thus the number of records finally displayed for specific users can be significantly less than a minimum number for a specific profile or record feed. In one implementation a reaper deletes data that is older than a specified time e.g. 6 months or a year .

In one implementation the reaper can perform the deletion of feed items purging as a batch up deletion. This can avoid deletion of large number of records that may lead to locking issues. In another implementation the reaper can be run often so that the table does not become difficult to manage e.g. size wise . In this way the reaper can work on a limited set of records. In one implementation the reaper may have logic that deletes certain items e.g. by an identification from tables e.g. those in or sections of the tables.

While the above discussion describes some implementations various additional implementations are described herein. In some instances different and or alternate implementations may be discussed. For example different types of feed queries and different systems and methods for generating an information feed may be described.

In various implementations an online social network may implement a platform for generating an information feed. The platform may be used to query one or more database tables for feed items and return the result of the query to generate an information feed. Thus the platform may provide one or more views of a database table storing feed items. In various implementations the result of the query is provided to a client application. A client application may refer to a computer application that may provide an application programming interface to other external computer applications such as a user s email client. Thus a client application may receive the result of the query and provide the result to a user at a user interface of a computing device.

In some implementations the platform for generating an information feed may include a first and second component. The first component may be an instantiation of a class of data objects that performs a database query. Thus the first component may query the database to identify feed items to be included in an information feed. The second component may be an instantiation of a class of data objects that receives parameters that drive the database query. Thus the second component may receive parameters from a user or client application and may pass the parameters to the first component to parameterize the database query.

In various implementations the platform for generating an information feed may retrieve formatting and contextual information associated with the result object and include the formatting and contextual information with the result object to generate an intermediary data structure. In some implementations formatting and contextual information may refer to additional information about a feed item that indicates a presentation such as a graphical representation of the feed item. Thus the intermediary data structure may be a data structure that stores all feed items to be included in the information feed as well as the contextual and formatting information associated with the feed items. Furthermore the intermediary data structure may be accessible by and readable by multiple client applications. Thus one or more client applications may render the intermediary data structure into an image or graphical depiction of the information feed.

In various implementations a feed item handler interface is provided. The feed item handler interface may customize feed items included in the result object by changing or modifying a presentation or functionality of one or more feed items. The feed item handler interface may handle database queries for a particular feed item type. Thus the feed item handler interface may receive an input identifying a new feed item type query data relevant to the new feed item type and provide the returned data to one or more feed items during the generation of the intermediary data structure. In various implementations the returned data is combined with the feed items to change or modify the shape or presentation of the feed times such that they include a new or different presentation or functionality when stored in the intermediary data structure.

In at block at least one feed parameter may be determined. In various implementations a feed parameter may refer to a parameter that identifies a characteristic of at least one feed item to be included in the information feed. In some implementations a characteristic of a feed item may refer to a type of data field included in the feed item. For example a feed item may have a particular data field or type of data field dedicated to storing a username of a user with which the feed item is associated. In various implementations a feed parameter for a type of feed may be determined based on the type of information used by the information feed that is being generated. For example if a news feed is being generated for a user the feed parameter may be the user s username because the username must first be identified in order to generate an information feed for that particular user.

In at block at least one feed search strategy may be determined based on the determined at least one feed parameter. In various implementations the feed search strategy may identify a feed query to be performed on a database system storing feed items. In some implementations the feed query may be a database query plan written in a database query language. The database query plan may be capable of identifying one or more feed items based on the feed parameters. In various implementations the feed search strategy may be identified based on the type of feed parameter that has been determined. Returning to the previous example if the feed parameter is a user s username the database service provider may implement a feed search strategy that queries only the type of data field of a feed item that is used to store a username.

In at block at least one feed item may be identified based on the determined at least one feed parameter and the at least one search strategy. Thus according to various implementations the database service provider may run the feed query as specified by the feed parameters and the feed search strategy to search the database system for feed items that should be included in the information feed. In various implementations the feed query may return a result that identifies all feed items that should be included in the information feed.

In at block a result object may be generated. In some implementations the result object may be a data structure including a result returned by the feed query. Thus the result object may include all feed items identified by the feed query. In various implementations if different client applications request the same feed query the client applications may access the results stored in the result object instead of each performing their own database query. Thus storing the feed items returned by the feed query in the result object reduces redundant and unnecessary iterations of the feed query that may otherwise be performed by client applications. Furthermore if one client application displays the same information feed several times during presentation of the information feed to a user the client application may retrieve the results from the result object instead of re querying the database multiple times.

In at block the result object may be stored in one or more storage mediums. In various implementations the one or more storage mediums may be included in a multitenant database accessible to a plurality of entities in an on demand computing services environment. Thus in response to querying the database and returning all relevant feed items the database service provider may store the result object in a multitenant database. In various implementations the result object is stored in a location accessible by multiple entities so that the multiple entities may access the results of the feed query without each of the entities having to execute its own feed query.

In at block a request to generate an information feed may be received. In various implementations the request may be issued by a client application. For example a client application may be a web user interface layer that renders and displays an information feed to a user of a database service. The user may provide an input indicating that an information feed should be displayed. For example a user may send a request to view feed tracked updates for a particular record. In response to receiving this request the web user interface layer may forward the request to one or more computing devices of the database service provider. In various implementations the request is a message identifying a type of information feed that should be generated and further identifying a record or entity for which the information feed should be generated for.

Accordingly in at block feed parameters may be identified. As previously discussed with reference to block a feed parameter may refer to a parameter that identifies a characteristic of a feed item to be included in an information feed. In various implementations the feed parameters may be identified by the database service provider in response to receiving the request of block . In various implementations the database service provider may determine the feed parameters based on designated associations between types of feeds and types of parameters that those feeds receive. A designated association may be an association between a parameter and a type of feed that determines what type of parameter a query looks to in order to generate the particular type of feed. In some implementations the designated association may be determined by a database service provider upon implementation of a database service.

For example as previously discussed with reference to block a news feed may be requested for a particular user. When implementing the database service the database service provider may have determined that a news feed may be generated based on a user ID. Thus a user s user ID may be a parameter associated with a news feed. Accordingly in response to receiving a request for a news feed a feed parameter of user ID may be identified based on the designated association for a news feed.

In various implementations the database service provider may use an implementation of a class of data objects such as an extensible java class to designate an association between the feed type and one or more parameters. In various implementations the class may define a library of functions that provides an interface between the client application and the software application that queries the database storing the feed items. The interface may receive parameters from the client application and pass the parameters to the software application that runs the query. A particular instantiation of the class of data objects may designate an associated between a feed type and one or more parameters.

Returning to the previous example the database service provider may provide an abstract base class called FeedParams. The class FeedParams may refer to a class of functions that receive one or more parameters from a client application and pass the one or more parameters to the computer application that performs the database query. For the information feed NewsFeed an implementation of the class FeedParams may be created and called NewsFeedParams. NewsFeedParams may be an instantiation of the class FeedParams that is specifically configured to receive and pass along the parameters that would be provided when a news feed for a record is requested. For example if a news feed for a user is requested the user s name or user ID may be a parameter. Thus NewsFeedParams may be configured to receive a user ID as a parameter and pass the user ID to a computer application that performs the database query.

In at block a feed search strategy may be identified based on the identified feed parameters. As previously discussed with reference to block a feed search strategy may identify a feed query or query plan to be issued to a database system storing feed items. In various implementations the feed search strategy may be identified in response to receiving the request of block .

As similarly discussed with reference to block the database service provider may use an abstract base class of data objects such as an extensible java class to implement the feed search strategy. In this instance the class may define a library of functions that receive feed parameters from the feed parameter interface and execute a query plan of the database based on the received parameters. Thus an implementation of the abstract base class may provide an interface between a software interface that receives parameters from the client application and the database that is queried. Moreover a particular instantiation of the class of data objects may designate an association between the types of parameters received and the type of query plan that is implemented.

Returning to the previous example the database service provider may provide an abstract base class called FeedStrategy. The class FeedStrategy may refer to a class of functions that execute a query plan of the database based on one or more received parameters. For the information feed NewsFeed an implementation of the class FeedStrategy may be created and called NewsFeedStrategy. NewsFeedStrategy may be an instantiation of the class FeedStrategy that is specifically configured to perform a query plan for the particular type of information feed NewsFeed. For example as previously discussed if a news feed for a user is requested the user s name or user ID may be a parameter. Thus NewsFeedStrategy may be configured to receive a user ID as a parameter and perform a database query based on the received parameter. In various implementations implementing a feed strategy for a particular type of information feed allows the database service provider to optimize the query plan for that particular type of information feed.

In at block feed items may be identified based on the feed parameters and feed strategy. Thus one or more computing devices or servers operated by the database service provider may execute the feed search strategy to query the database. In some implementations the entire one or more database tables storing feed items may be queried. In various implementations the query plan identified by the feed strategy may be designed so that the query is constrained. For example the query may be constrained to one database table or a portion of a database table. Implementing a feed search strategy that is constrained may reduce the number of operations performed by the query plan and may further optimize the query.

In various implementations a feed item may be returned as a result of the query plan if the feed item includes one or more data values that is the same as one or more data values identified by the feed parameters. For example a feed item may be a status update for a user. The feed item may include a data field or entry that identifies the username of the user with which the feed item is associated. If the feed item returns a username that is identified by the feed parameter then the feed item may be returned as a result of the query.

Returning to the previous example a news feed may be requested for a first user. In this instance the first user may be Madison Rigsby who has just posted a comment on a second user s profile. Because a news feed is being requested for the first user the instantiations NewsFeedParams and NewsFeedStrategy may be used to determine a query plan for the requested information feed. Thus the parameter received by NewsFeedParams may be the first user s name e.g. Madison Rigsby . In various implementations the query plan may search database tables storing feed items for feed items including a data field or entry that stores the data value Madison Rigsby. In this instance the feed item generated by Madison Rigsby s post would store her name in order to identify which user made the post. Because the feed item stores her name the feed item would be returned as a result of the query. In various implementations just the feed item ID and not the whole feed item may be returned as a result of the query.

In at block a result object may be generated. As discussed with reference to block the result object may be a data structure that includes feed items returned by the database query executed by the feed search strategy. In various implementations the result object may include feed item IDs instead of the entire feed items. Thus if a feed item is identified as a feed item that should be included in the information feed the ID for that feed item may retrieved and stored in the result object. Storing the feed item ID instead of the entire feed item may reduce the size of the result object and reduce the storage of data that may be redundant e.g. several identified feed items may store much of the same data . In various implementations the database service provider may use a computing device such as a storage server to generate the result object. The result object may be stored in one or more storage mediums of a multi tenant database system.

In various implementations the generation of the result object may also provide the ability to sort the feed items according to one or more characteristics of the feed item. In various implementations sorting the feed items may determine an order for feed items included in the information feed. For example the result object may be a linear data structure. The feed items stored in the result object may be stored according to an order. The order may be determined based on a sorting of the feed items. In various implementations the feed items may be sorted according to a value stored in a particular data field of each feed item. For example the feed items may be sorted according to a post date identifying when a feed item was posted when a last comment was made or when a last action or a last activity occurred. In this instance the feed items may be sorted from most recent to least recent. The feed items or feed item IDs may be stored in the result object according to an order determined by the sorting. When the information feed including the feed items is rendered the feed items may be presented in the information feed according to the determined order.

In at block additional feed data objects may be identified based on the feed items identified by the result object. As previously discussed the result object may include feed item IDs. However because the result object may largely include feed item IDs and other object identifiers the information included in the result object may be relatively sparse. Thus additional feed data objects may be identified and retrieved to enhance the data included in the result object and provide additional information that may be used to display feed items to be included in the information feed.

In various implementations additional feed data objects may refer to data objects that may be related to or associated with a feed item to be included in the information feed. In some implementations an additional feed data object may be a data value stored in a data field of a record related to the feed item. For example the data value may identify the last comment that was made for a record related to the feed item how many people have liked the feed item a tracked change or the identity of a user who has edited the feed item.

In various implementations the database service provider may query the database storing the feed items to identify the additional feed data objects. In some implementations the database service provider may use one or more computing devices to execute a software application such as a data loader to query data values stored in each feed item identified by the result object. The database service provider may retrieve data values stored by the feed item. For example the result object may include a feed item created by a post that was made by a user. The data loader may use the feed item ID to identify and locate the feed item and retrieve one or more data values storing a body of the post which may be a string of text that was provided by the user. As discussed above the data loader may also retrieve related data objects that may store data values identifying an additional post or event related to the string of text. For example a second user may indicate that he or she likes the post made by a first user. The like may be stored in a data object that is a child of the feed item. In another example the post may be a link to a url. Thus the data loader may retrieve the url corresponding to the link.

In at block the additional feed data objects may be included with the result object. As similarly discussed with reference to block the database service provider may use a computing device such as a storage server to generate the result object. In some implementations the result object may be stored in one or more storage mediums of a multi tenant database system.

In at block an indication of a new feed type may be received. In various implementations the indication of a new feed type may be received from a client application and received by the database service provider. According to some implementations the indication of a new feed type may be received when a client application requests a new or different view of an information feed. In various implementations such a request may be provided by a user via a user interface of a display device.

In at block the new feed type may be registered with a class of data objects. In various implementations the class of data objects may be implemented using a java class. In some implementations the database service provider may register the new feed type by defining a new enumeration value that identifies the new feed type. Registering the new feed type with the class of data objects identifies the new feed type as a data object having an object ID that may be used by any client application having requisite access to the database system. Thus registering the new feed type makes the new feed type accessible to and usable by multiple client applications.

In at block feed parameters and a feed search strategy may be identified. As similarly discussed with reference to information feed generation method a database service provider may identify the feed parameters and a feed search strategy based on designated associations between feed types and parameters received by the feed types. Therefore while the feed type may be a new instantiation of the class of data objects the feed parameters and feed search strategy may be identified based on existing designated associations.

In at block one or more feed parameters may be declared based on the identified feed parameters. In various implementations the one or more feed parameters may be declared to the class of data objects. In various implementations declaring the one or more feed parameters identifies them as a variable that may be used by the new feed type. Accordingly declaring the one or more feed parameters allows the new feed type to receive the identified one or more feed parameters.

In at block a feed search strategy may be declared based on the identified feed search strategy. As similarly discussed with reference to block the feed search strategy may be declared to the class of data objects. Declaring the feed search strategy identifies it as a variable that may be used by the new feed type. Accordingly declaring the feed search strategy allows the new feed type to use the identified feed search strategy when executing a query plan. Thus according to various implementations once the feed search strategy and feed parameters are declared the new feed type may be used by one or more client applications to provide a new or different view of the feed items stored in the database system.

In various implementations a feed presentation layer is used to implement information feed presentation method . As similarly discussed with reference to the feed data layer the feed presentation layer may be a layer of a computer program or application. In this instance the computer program may be used to render the information feed or translate the information feed from a first format to a second format. Accordingly information feed presentation method may receive a result object identify contextual and formatting information associated with feed items identified by the result object translate the result object based on the contextual and formatting information and generate an intermediate data structure that includes the translated result object.

In at block a result object including feed items and additional feed data objects for presentation in an information feed may be received. As discussed with reference to block the result object may be a data structure including feed items or feed item IDs as well as additional feed data objects. Thus the result object may include various information about one or more feed items. However in some implementations the information included in the received result object might not include information indicating how such information should be presented or displayed by a client application. Thus additional information may be identified and retrieved to determine how the feed item should be presented.

In at block formatting information and contextual information may be identified. In various implementations formatting information may refer to information indicating a visual or spatial configuration of data included in the received result object. For example formatting information may provide a visual template that determines that the body of a post should be displayed at the top of the feed item while a time stamp should be displayed in a footer of the feed item. Contextual information may refer to information that supplements raw data included in the result object to create a description that may be understood by a user. Thus the contextual information may convert an indication of an event or a data field identifier into a full text sentence that provides a description of the event or data value identified by a data field identifier for a feed item. Some examples of contextual information may be a photographic image a full name of a user users identified by mentions hashtags links tracked change text and full descriptions of time stamps. In various implementations an mention may refer to an indicator or identifier that indicates that a user has been mentioned in a post. In some implementations the user may be provided with a message that indicates that the user was mentioned. In various implementations a hashtag may refer to an indicator or identifier that may mark a string of text characters as a keyword. In some implementations marking a string of characters as a keyword makes the string of characters searchable by search functions that may be provided by the database service provider.

In various implementations the formatting and contextual information may supplement the information included in the result object to indicate or identify a presentation of a feed item. In various implementations a presentation of a feed item may refer to a graphical configuration of the information included in the feed item. Thus the formatting and contextual information may identify a particular configuration according to which the information included in a feed item is displayed. In various implementations at block formatting and contextual information may be identified for all feed items identified by the result object.

In various implementations the formatting and contextual information may be identified based on designated associations between a type of feed item or additional feed data object and a rule established by a database service provider. In various implementations the associations may be designated by the database service provider. Thus according to various implementations the database service provider may maintain one or more records storing a library of rules. Each of the rules may be associated with a particular type of feed item. For example if a feed item identifies a tracked change in which the owner of a record changes a rule associated with a tracked change of owner may be called to identify and generate contextual information such as a text sentence describing a tracked change.

For example the result object may include a feed item identifying a tracked changed for a particular record. While the feed item may identify that a change has occurred various other information might be missing such as which user made the change and what the change was. Furthermore while the tracked change may be identified as a tracked change by data field identifier used by the database system provider the data field identifier may be a data value that is not understandable by a user of the database system. For example the data field identifier may be a string of numbers or a memory address. Thus contextual information may be retrieved to determine how such information should be presented in the information feed viewed by the user. In this instance the database service provider may call on a rule associated with tracked changes in ownership to render to the tracked change into a text sentence that may be displayed in an information feed and understood by a user of the database system.

In another example contextual information may be identified and retrieved to translate a user ID such as UID910 into the user s full name such as Madison Rigsby. Similarly contextual and formatting information may be used to identify and retrieve urls and photos. For example the received result object may include a feed item that identifies a user associated with the feed item. In this example the user may have generated the feed item by creating a post. In response to identifying the user s ID or name the database service provider may query the feed item database for a photographic image of the user to display with the feed item.

In various implementations the contextual information may be based on the user s location. For example if a user is located in the United States full text sentences the user s name and time stamps may be presented according to local customs in the United States. In one example a time stamp may indicate that a tracked change occurred at 12 30 PM on Jan. 02 2012. In this instance the user is located in the United States so the date is displayed as month day year. In another example the user may be located in Germany. In this instance the date would be displayed as day month year. Similar modifications may be made for sentence structure and presentation of names.

Accordingly in at block the result object may be combined with the contextual and formatting information. In various implementations the database service provider may apply the rules to the feed items included in the result object to combine the contextual and formatting information with the information stored in the result object. Incorporating the contextual and formatting information supplements the data of the result object to translate it from raw data into data that may be understandable to a user of the database system when presented in an information feed.

In at block an intermediary data structure may be generated. In various implementations the intermediary data structure is generated based on the translated result object. Thus the intermediary data structure may be a data structure that stores the translated result object including the raw data from the result object the formatting information and the contextual information. Thus the intermediary data structure may include sufficient information to identify a presentation of a feed item in an information feed that may be rendered for presentation to a user of the database system and understood by the user. Furthermore the intermediary data structure may include sufficient information to allow rendering of the intermediary data structure into a presentation of the information feed without any additional database query operations.

In various implementations the intermediary data structure may be stored in a mid level language capable of being read and rendered by client applications. In some implementations a mid level language may refer to an intermediary format that may be read by multiple client applications and rendered by each one into a different output as discussed in greater detail below with respect to block . In various implementations the intermediary data structure may be stored in a location of the database system that is accessible by several client applications.

In at block the intermediary data structure may be provided to one or more client applications. As discussed in greater detail with reference to the database system may include several client applications that provide database services to users of the database system. In various implementations each client application may be capable of requesting an information feed. In response to receiving the request the intermediary data structure may be provided to a client application for rendering.

In at block the intermediary data structure may be rendered. Thus according to various implementations the intermediary data structure may be rendered by a client application into an output. In various implementations the process of rendering the intermediary data structure may refer to translating the intermediary data structure into a higher level format that is more specific to a particular application. For example the mid level representation of the information feed may be rendered or translated into HTML. Rendering of the intermediary data structure may involve converted text characters such as an apostrophe into an HTML representation according to HTML syntax such as APOS . Thus according to some implementations upon being rendered into an HTML file by the client application the information feed may be presented to a user at a user interface displayed on a display device of a computer system.

In various implementations the intermediary data structure may be rendered by several client applications. For example a first client application may render the intermediary data structure into an image displayed on a mobile device such as a mobile phone while a second client application may render the same intermediary data structure into a HTML web page. Thus the same intermediary data structure may be rendered into two different outputs by two different client applications. Accordingly redundant database queries are reduced because several client applications have access to the intermediary data structure and do not have to perform their own database queries to acquire information included in the intermediary data structure or any additional information prior to rendering the intermediary data structure into a presentation of the information feed.

In various implementations feed pagination method is performed by a data layer used to perform feed generation method . More specifically feed pagination method may be implemented by the feed search strategy used by the data layer. Thus feed pagination method may provide paging during the generation of the information feed as provided by the feed data layer but prior to translation or rendering of the feed items as provided by the feed presentation layer. Thus feed pagination method paginates result objects provided to the feed presentation layer but does not alter the operation of the feed presentation layer. Accordingly the operation of feed pagination method is transparent to client applications and may be implemented without changing the client applications.

In at block a first result object including a first portion of feed items may be generated. In various implementations a portion of feed items may refer to a designated number of feed items that may be displayed at a single time. Thus the portion of feed items may be a subset of all feed items to be displayed in an information feed. In some implementations the size of the portion of feed items may be determined by a user via a direct input provided to a user interface. For example the user may specify how may feed items are displayed per page. In some implementations the database service provider may determine the size of the portion of feed items. For example the database service provider may designate an automatic value that is applied to any or all information feeds generated using feed pagination method .

In various implementations the first result object includes a feed pagination token. The feed pagination token may be a data structure that identifies the last feed item included in the first portion of feed items. For example the feed pagination token may identify the last feed item displayed in a page. By providing an indication of where the first portion of feed items ends the feed pagination token may also provide an indication of where a second portion of feed items begins. In various implementations the second portion of feed items would begin with the feed item that succeeds the last feed item of the first portion of feed items. For example a news feed may include 19 feed items such as posts arranged within the feed from most recent to least recent. A first portion of feed items may include feed items . In this instance the feed pagination token may be a data structure that stores a data value identifying the feed item ID of the 10feed item. Based on the indication of the last feed item being the 10feed item the data layer may infer that the first feed item of the second portion of feed items should be the 11feed item of the feed.

In at block the first result object and pagination token may be provided to the feed presentation layer. As similarly discussed with respect to blocks and the feed items identified by the result object may be translated and stored in an intermediary data structure. In various implementations the presence of the feed pagination token does not affect or alter translation or storage of the feed items by the feed presentation layer. Thus the first portion of feed items may be included in an intermediary data structure that is rendered by a client application and displayed in a display device to a user as previously discussed with reference to information feed presentation method .

In at block a request for a second portion of feed items may be received. In various implementations the request may be received from a user via a user interface displayed in a display device of a computer system. For example the user may view the first portion of feed items as a first page of the information feed. The display device may further display an image including a data field. The data field may display the text Show more. The data field may be capable of receiving an input from the user that requests a second portion of feed items. In response to receiving the input from the user the request may be sent to the feed presentation layer in the form of a message.

In at block the pagination token may be provided to the feed data layer. In various implementations in response to receiving the input from the user the feed presentation layer may forward the request for a second portion of feed items to the feed data layer. In various implementations the forwarded request may be a message that includes the feed pagination token. Accordingly at block the feed data layer may receive the request and the feed pagination token from the feed presentation layer.

In at block a second result object including the second portion of feed items may be generated. In various implementations the data layer generates the second result object in response to receiving the feed pagination token. Thus receipt of the feed pagination token may provide an indication of when the second portion of feed items should be generated. Furthermore the data layer may read the value stored in the feed pagination structure to determine where the second portion of feed items begins. Upon generating the second portion of feed items the data layer may overwrite the value stored in the feed pagination token with a value that identifies the last feed item included in the second portion of feed items. The pagination token may be included in the second result object. In various implementations feed pagination method may be repeated until the entire information feed has been displayed.

In various implementations providing such an interface allows a client application or user to create new feed item types without having to create an entirely new type of database query. Because multiple client applications may share access to the new feed item type the amount of code used to implement a new feed item type may be reduced. Thus according to some implementations feed customization method may receive a result object receive at least one custom object and include the at least one custom object with the first result object to define an intermediary data structure.

In at block a result object may be received. As discussed with reference to block a result object may be a data structure including a result of a feed query the result of the feed query including at least one feed item to be included in an information feed. In various implementations the at least one feed item may have a first presentation. In some implementations the first presentation may refer to a first graphical configuration of the information included in the feed item. The graphical configuration of the feed item may indicate how information included in the feed item such as text images or the body of a post is organized and displayed after being rendered by client application. For example the presentation of a feed item may include information that identifies how text images and the body of a post are oriented and organized with respect to each other.

In at block at least one custom object associated with the at least one feed item may be received. In various implementations a custom object may refer to a data object or structure that includes one or more data values to be included in the feed item. The one or more data values may identify a visual representation or functionality to be included with a portion of the feed item. For example a custom object may refer to a string of text an image or a data field capable of receiving an input. According to various implementations the at least one custom object provides a second presentation of the at least one feed item. In various implementations the second presentation may refer to the appearance of a feed item that includes the additional visual representation and or functionality identified by the custom object.

In at block the at least one custom object may be included with the result object to define an intermediary data structure. As similarly discussed with reference to block the intermediary data structure may be a data structure that stores a translated result object including the raw data from the result object formatting information and contextual information. In various implementations feed customization method may provide a user or client application with an access point through which the user or client application may change or modify the translation process applied to the result object. In some implementations the custom object may change or modify a translation process applied to the result object so that the feed items included in the intermediary data structure include the additional visual representation or functionality identified by the custom object prior to being rendered by the client application.

In at block the intermediary data structure may be stored on one or more storage mediums. As similarly discussed with reference to block the one or more storage mediums may be included in a multitenant database accessible to a plurality of entities in an on demand computing services environment. Thus in response to including the at least one custom object with the result object to define an intermediary data structure the database service provider may store the intermediary data structure in a location accessible by multiple entities such as client applications that may render the intermediary data structure into an information feed displayed on a display device.

In at block a result object may be received. According to various implementations the result object may be received from a computer application such as a feed data layer implementing information feed generation method . As discussed with reference to block a result object may be a data structure including a result such as one or more feed items returned by the feed query. Thus the result object may include several feed item IDs and additional feed data objects to be included in an information feed.

In at block custom posts associated with feed items included in the result object may be received. In various implementations custom posts may refer to one or more data values or events created by a user of a database service that customize data fields and or data values that may be stored in a feed item. Thus the user may issue a custom post in order to introduce or add a functionality or appearance to one or more data fields of the feed item. An example of such functionality may be a poll. In various implementations a poll may refer to a presentation of a user generated interrogatory as well as several options or choices responsive to the interrogatory. Other users of the database service may select one or more options in order to vote on a response to the interrogatory. The results of the vote or poll may be displayed. In this instance a custom post may be used to introduce a poll into a data field of a feed item. In various implementations a custom post associated with a feed item may refer to a custom post made while the user is directly interacting with the feed item.

In at block the received custom posts may be included with the result object to define an intermediary data structure. As similarly discussed with reference to block the custom posts may be incorporated during the translation process applied to the result object such that one or more feed items included in the intermediary data structure are modified to include the additional visual representation or functionality identified by the custom posts.

In various implementations a feed item handler interface may be used to include the received custom posts with the feed items. The feed item handler interface may be an instantiation of a class of data objects that handles combining custom posts with feed items during translation of the feed item into an intermediary data structure. For example the feed item handler interface may receive the custom posts and include the custom posts in portions of a feed item such as a body or an auxiliary body of a post. The modified feed items may then be translated and stored in the intermediary data structure.

Returning to a previous example a first user may issue a request to create a poll. As previously discussed a poll may be a presentation of a user generated interrogatory as well as several options or choices responsive to the interrogatory. In this instance the first user may be interacting with a feed item such as a second user s post on the second user s profile indicating that the second user has a new lead on a sales opportunity. The first user may issue a request to create a poll that may appear in the feed item in order to poll other users to determine whether or not the sales opportunity should be pursued. In response to receiving the request the feed item handler interface may query the user for relevant information such as any text strings to be included in the poll. For example the poll may include the options of Yes and No . The feed item handler interface may then configure the body of a feed item to include text fields displaying the interrogatory and choices for the poll. The feed item handler interface may further configure the body of the feed item to receive an input that identifies a user s selection of a choice or option.

In at block additional feed items may be identified based on the received custom posts. In various implementations including the custom posts in the intermediary data structure may cause triggers to run. In some implementations triggers may be automated search routines executed in response to a particular event such as the insertion of a post in a feed item. In various implementations the database service provider executes the automated search routines. The triggers may search the custom posts for mentions or calls to other feed items. In some implementations the mentions or calls may be a mention or link to another user or record such as a text string that includes a user s username a hashtag or an mention.

In one example a first user may insert a custom post such as a poll within a feed item created by the first user. The custom post may include a string of text which mentions a second user. In this instance the first user may have created a poll asking where a business meeting should be held. The poll may present several strings of text identifying options that may be voted on. One of the strings of text may be Madison Rigsby s office. Thus the text makes mention of a second user Madison Rigsby. The insertion of the custom post may cause triggers to run. The triggers may search the text of the post and identify the mention of Madison Rigsby. Additional feed items or additional feed data objects associated with Madison Rigsby such as a photographic image may be identified and retrieved in response to identifying a mention of Madison Rigsby in the custom post.

In at block the additional feed items may be included in the intermediary data structure. As similarly discussed with reference to block the intermediary data structure may be a data structure storing translated feed items that may be rendered by one or more client applications. Thus according to various implementations identified formatting and contextual information for the additional feed items may be retrieved. The additional feed items may be translated into a mid level language based on the formatting and contextual information. The translated additional feed items may then be included in the intermediary data structure.

In at block custom events associated with the feed items included in the intermediary data structure may be identified. In various implementations a custom event may be a machine or system generated notification. In various implementations the notification may be a message such as a string of text generated by a database service provider. In some implementations the custom event may be a pointer such as a foreign key. Thus the custom event may insert a pointer that points to one or more data values such as a string of text stored in a server of a database system.

According to various implementations a custom event is generated in response to the occurrence of a first event such as a workflow approval. In various implementations a workflow may refer to an automated process established by a user of the database service Force.com provided by salesforce.com . An automated process may refer to a process in which the user has defined the steps that occur within the process but execution of the process has been automated by the database service provider. For example a user may automate processes such emailing alerts updating data fields or scripting inbound and outbound calls. In various implementations an automated process may include several steps. At least one of the steps may ask for the approval of a user before proceeding to the next step. If the user approves a workflow approval message may be generated that indicates that the workflow was approved. In response to the generation of the workflow approval message a computing device operated by the database service provider may generate a custom event. In this instance the custom event may be a feed item including a message such as a string of text indicating that the workflow has been approved.

In another example a custom event may be generated in response to a tracked change and combined with a feed item identifying the tracked change. In various implementations a tracked change may be a change in a data field associated with a tracked data object. For example a case may have an associated data record. The data record may include a data field that identifies the owner of the case. In this instance the case may be initially assigned to a first user. However the case may be reassigned to a second user. Thus the data value identifying the owner of the case may change. In various implementations this change is tracked by the database system. Thus a feed item may be generated that indicates that ownership of the record has changed. Thus the change in ownership may trigger a custom event. In this instance the custom event may be the generation of a text message that provides a full text description of the change. For example the text message may be a sentence that identifies the first user the second user and a time stamp for the change. In various implementations a feed item handler interface may insert the text message into the body of the feed item.

In at block the identified custom events may be included in the intermediary data structure. As similarly discussed with reference to block formatting and contextual information for the custom events may be identified and retrieved. The custom events may be translated into a mid level language based on the formatting and contextual information. The translated custom events may then be included in the intermediary data structure. Thus according to various implementations the intermediary data structure may include custom messages generated by a computer system or machine operated by the database service provider.

In at block the intermediary data structure may be provided to a client application for rendering. Thus according to various implementations the client application may render the intermediary data structure into a second data structure capable of being used by that particular client application. For example a web based user interface application may render the intermediary data structure into hypertext transfer language HTML . Once rendered into HTML the rendered intermediary data structure including the custom events may be displayed to a user as a web page in a display device of a computing system.

In at block an indication of a new feed item type to be created may be received. In various implementations the indication of a new feed item type may be received from a client application by the database service provider. The indication may be provided to the client application by a user of an on demand service. In various implementations the user may provide the indication of a new feed item type in order to track a specific type of event. For example the user may want to track workflow approvals.

In at block a schema associated with the new feed item type may be defined. In various implementations a schema may refer to a template or structure which may define the representation of a feed item and information included within the feed item within a database system. Thus defining the schema determines how feed items and information included in feed items may be stored. For example a schema may be defined for a new feed item type such as a poll. The schema may define how choices for the poll and results for the poll will be represented and stored within data tables included in the database system. In some implementations the database service provider may automatically define a schema for a new feed item type as a default setting of an automated process. In various implementations the automatically defined schema may be modified or customized by the user. In various implementations the new schema may be defined entirely by the client application or a user of a database service.

In at block the new feed item type may be registered with a class of data objects. As similarly discussed with reference to block the class of data objects may be a java class of functions that handles queries for different feed item types. In various implementations the database service provider may define a new enumeration value that identifies the new feed item type. Registering the new feed item type with the class of data objects makes the new feed item type accessible to and usable by any client application that may request an information feed.

In at block a feed item handler interface may be generated based on the new feed item type. As discussed with reference to block the feed item handler interface may handle queries for a new feed item type. Thus each time a new feed item type is called the feed item handler interface may handle the database query and incorporate the queried data in a feed item. In various implementations a feed item handler interface may be instantiated for each new feed item type and handle queries for that type. In some implementations a single instance of a feed item handler interface may handle queries for multiple new feed item types.

In various implementations database may be used to store feed items. The feed items may be stored in one or more data tables within database . Thus database may be a sequential data structure that may be queried to generate information feeds. In various implementations database is part of a multi tenant database accessible to a plurality of entities in an on demand computing services environment. Thus database may store feed items for a plurality of users records and entities that may be associated with database .

Feed data layer may be a layer implemented within a computer application that performs the method of information feed generation method . Thus according to various implementations feed data layer may query the database to identify feed items to include in an information feed. Furthermore feed data layer may also include a data loader that retrieves additional information such as additional feed data objects. Feed data layer may package the results of the query and retrieval into a result object. As discussed with reference to feed data layer may implement pagination method .

Feed data extensions may refer to a portion of database system that stores the classes of data objects used by the feed data layer. In various implementations the portion of database system may refer to one or more storage servers used to store the classes of data objects. Instantiations of the classes of data objects included in feed data extensions may allow a user or client application to create a new feed type as described with reference to create new feed type method .

Feed presentation layer may be a layer implemented within a computer application that performs the method of information feed presentation method . Thus according to various implementations feed presentation layer may receive the result object from feed data layer and may identify and retrieve formatting and contextual information for each feed item included in the result object. Feed data layer may include the retrieved data with the result object to generate an intermediary data structure.

Feed presentation extensions may refer to a portion of database system that stores the classes of data objects used to implement interfaces used by feed presentation layer . In various implementations the portion of database system may refer to one or more storage servers used to store the classes of data objects. Instantiations of the classes of data objects included in feed presentation extensions may allow a user of client to create a new feed item type as described with reference to create new feed item type method .

Email client application may be a client application that selects specific feed items to render into emails in batches. In various implementations email client application may create its own feed type. For example email client application may access a class of data objects stored in feed data extensions to implement its own feed search strategy to define a new feed type. The new feed type may include an instance of feed parameters and feed search strategy. Feed data layer may perform the feed search and generate a result object. The result object may be passed to feed presentation layer which may translate the result object into an intermediate data structure. Email client application may receive the intermediate data structure from feed presentation layer and render the intermediate data structure into HTML for display by an email client.

Web user interface layer renders an intermediary data structure provided by feed presentation layer into HTML. Web user interface layer may wrap appropriate strings in Elements and add URLs to photos users and records where appropriate. In various implementations the URLs are provided by feed presentation layer . In some implementations the HTML output generated by web user interface layer is provided to other client applications. For example in various implementations the HTML output may be provided to web page client application . In some implementations web page client application may simply display the HTML output to a user as a webpage in a display device of a computer system.

In another example the HTML output may be provided to Chatter connect user interface . In various implementations Chatter connect user interface may provide an application program interface to Chatter that serializes operation of feed presentation layer to provide external clients a RESTful interface to presentation layer . Thus external web applications connecting to the database service Chatter provided by salesforce.com may request information feeds and be presented with information feeds via Chatter connect user interface .

In yet another example the HTML output file may be provided to VisualForce client application . In various implementations VisualForce client application may be an application that provides the database service VisualForce to one or more users of a database system. In various implementations the HTML output file may be provided to VisualForce client application for modification by a user. Thus according to various implementations a user of the database service VisualForce may request information feeds generated by feed data layer and feed presentation layer . The user may be presented with a rendered HTML file that may be modified via features provided by VisualForce .

The specific details of the specific aspects of implementations disclosed herein may be combined in any suitable manner without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosed implementations. However other implementations may be directed to specific implementations relating to each individual aspect or specific combinations of these individual aspects.
