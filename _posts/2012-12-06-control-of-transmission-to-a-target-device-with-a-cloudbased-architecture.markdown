The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof. In the drawings similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.

The computing devices may each be any type of computer or computing device such as a desktop computer laptop computer netbook tablet computer mobile computing device such as a cell phone smartphone personal digital assistant or other mobile or handheld or wireless computing device or any other computer computing device. The computing devices may include one or more of a user input output devices such as a display keyboard and a pointing device such as a track ball mouse touch pad touch screen or other pointing device .

The computing devices may include memory to store data and software computer instructions a processor for executing software computer instructions and providing overall control to the computer. The computing devices may each include an operating system OS stored in memory and executed at startup for example.

Referring to the computing devices may execute or run a web browser application configured to access data maintained on one or more other computing devices and or the cloud based server via the network .

The cloud based server which may include a processor and memory may run one or more applications such as server application to provide a cloud based service or a cloud based computing service where cloud based server and or other servers associated with the cloud based service may provide resources such as software data media e.g. video audio files and other information and management of such resources to computing devices via the network .

According to an example embodiment computing resources such as application programs and file storage may be remotely provided by the cloud based service e.g. by cloud based server to a computing device over the network through the web browser application running on the computing device . For example a client computing device may include the web browser application running applications e.g. Java applets or other applications which may include application programming interfaces API s to more sophisticated applications such as server application running on remote servers that provide the cloud based service cloud based server as an example embodiment.

In an example embodiment through the web browser application a user can use a computing device to log on to cloud based services e.g. by the web browser application communicating with cloud based server of the cloud based computing system to access a server application . After logging on to the server application the user may create edit save and delete files on cloud based server and may establish set up or change edit various options such as user preferences and or system settings and or may receive or download software e.g. operating system or other software or software updates various data files or media files user preferences and or system settings and other information previously stored on the cloud based server via the server application running on the cloud based server .

In an example embodiment as shown in a user of a first computing device may compose a message e.g. an e mail message text message instant message or any other data transmission for transmission to a target computing device e.g. computing device via the cloud based computing system . The first computing device may access a message creation server application running on cloud based server to compose the message and the message may be stored to a message storage queue maintained in memory by the cloud based server . The cloud based server may in turn employ a message transmission server application to transmit one or more messages stored in the message storage queue to the target computing device . It will be noted that the determination of when to transmit messages stored in the message storage queue to the target computing device may carried out solely by the cloud based server architecture and not at the direction of either the transmitting computing device or the target computing device . Rather the cloud based server may direct the transmission of messages to the target computing device according to one or more cloud based server defined parameters.

In an exemplary embodiment the cloud based server defined parameter may be an elapsed time since a prior authorization to transmit a message to a target device. For example the message transmission server application running on the cloud based server may be configured to authorize the transmission of messages to the target computing device only at fixed time intervals e.g. every 15 minutes . Specifically the message transmission server application may detect an elapsed time since a prior attempted transmission of at least one message and if the elapsed time exceeds a threshold transmission interval maintained by a server data store the message transmission server application may authorize the transmission of one or more messages created by the user of the first computing device if any during the time elapsed since a prior authorization to transmit messages e.g. a batch type transmission of according to the server maintained threshold transmission interval . The initiation of such transmissions by the message transmission server application may be wholly independent of any action by the computing device or the target computing device .

In another exemplary embodiment the cloud based server defined parameter may be a prospective transmission practicability index computed by the cloud based server and associated with the practicability of successfully transmitting one or more messages to a target computing device . For example the message transmission server application may be configured to authorize the transmission of messages to the target computing device only when a prospective transmission practicability index computed from localized context information associated with the target computing device complies with one or more threshold metrics maintained as a threshold transmission practicability index maintained by the server data store . Specifically the cloud based server may receive localized context data associated with the target computing device including but not limited to at least one of a serial number of the target computing device a model number of the target computing device a network address of the target computing device a geographical identifier of the target computing device a power indicator of the target computing device a bandwidth indicator of the target computing device an inertial signal associated with the target computing device an imaging signal associated with the target computing device or a user input output indicator associated with the target computing device . The message transmission server application may compare a transmission practicability index computed from the localized context information associated with the target computing device to the threshold transmission practicability index and if the transmission practicability index computed from the localized context information associated with the target computing device complies with the threshold transmission practicability index transmit a message to the target computing device . Otherwise the message is retained in the message storage queue until the transmission practicability index computed from the localized context information associated with the target computing device complies with the threshold transmission practicability index if ever.

In another exemplary embodiment the cloud based server defined parameter may be a historical transmission parameter . For example the message transmission server application of the cloud based server may be configured to authorize the transmission of messages to the target computing device only when various prospective message parameters e.g. prospective transmission message lengths correspond to historical ranges for those message parameters. Specifically the cloud based server may determine a historical message transmission length e.g. an average amount of time required to transmit a message a bit length of a message etc. associated with one or more messages transmitted to the target computing device by the cloud based server . The message transmission server application may compare a historical message transmission length to a prospective message transmission length of a message based on current context data and if the prospective transmission length of the message corresponds to the historical message transmission length e.g. is within a tolerance range of the historical message transmission length transmit the message to the target computing device . Otherwise the message may be retained in the message storage queue until the prospective transmission length of the message complies with the historical message transmission length if ever.

Further in the following figures that depict various flow processes various operations may be depicted in a box within a box manner. Such depictions may indicate that an operation in an internal box may comprise an optional example embodiment of the operational step illustrated in one or more external boxes. However it should be understood that internal box operations may be viewed as independent operations separate from any associated external boxes and may be performed in any sequence with respect to all other illustrated operations or may be performed concurrently.

Operation illustrates receiving localized context information associated with the at least one target device. For example a target computing device may include one or more context sensors configured to detect context information associated with the target computing device and or its environment and generate context data . It may be the case that such context data may be indicative of an impact on the ability of the cloud based server to transmit messages to the target computing device . For example context data indicating that the target computing device is in a remote location may correlate with difficulties in transmitting messages to the target computing device . As such one or more context sensors of the target computing device may detect a context of the target computing device and or its environment and transmit data associated with the detecting to the message transmission server application running on the cloud based server where the context information may be employed to control transmission of messages to the target computing device .

Operation illustrates associating at least in part via a cloud based architecture at least one historical transmission length for at least one transmission to at least one target device with historical localized context information associated with the at least one target device. For example as shown in the message transmission server application running on the cloud based server may detect an authorization e.g. detecting the setting of a flag by the message transmission server application indicative of an authorization detecting the actual transmission of one or more messages by the message transmission server application etc. of a transmission of a message to a target computing device and store a time stamp from a system clock to the server data store . The message transmission server application running on the cloud based server may then determine an amount of time elapsed between the authorization of the transmission of a message to a target computing device and a confirmation of transmission of the message to the target computing device . For example upon receipt of a message the target computing device may generate a delivery confirmation associated with the message . Upon receipt of the delivery confirmation the message transmission server application may compare a current system clock time to the time stamp associated with the transmission of the message stored in the server data store to determine a elapsed length of time for the transmission of the message . The elapsed time may be stored as a historical transmission parameter in the server data store . Further as noted above it may be the case that context data sensed by target computing device and or the cloud based server may be indicative of the ability of the cloud based server to transmit messages to the target computing device . As such context data associated with a current state of a target computing device may be a proxy for a prospective transmission length associated with a given message . As such the message transmission server application may map context data detected at a given point in time to a transmission length determined for a message transmitted at about that point in time and store mapping data to the server data store e.g. as a look up table . Such associations of transmission lengths and corresponding context data may occur for multiple message transmissions over a period of time to provide a historical data set of message transmission length context data mappings. In one exemplary embodiment the transmission length of may be an average transmission length for multiple message transmissions having at least partially common context data . In another exemplary embodiment the transmission length of may be a weighted average transmission length for multiple message transmissions having at least partially common context data where messages having more proximate transmission time stamps are given greater weight than messages having more distant transmission timestamps.

Operation illustrates determining at least in part via a cloud based architecture at least one prospective message transmission practicability index according to a comparison of localized context information and the at least one historical transmission length. For example as noted above it may be the case that context data associated with a current state of a target computing device may be a proxy for a prospective transmission length associated with a given message an accordingly the practicality of such a transmission. As such upon receipt of proximate context data associated with a current state of a target computing device that context data may be mapped to one or more historical transmission lengths e.g. via comparison to context data previously mapped to previously detected transmission lengths associated with messages to determine a prospective transmission length for a pending message corresponding with the present context data . Upon determination of that prospective transmission length the prospective transmission length may be correlated to one or more prospective transmission practicability indices . For example a prospective transmission length within a first time range e.g. less than five minutes may be equated to a prospective message transmission practicability index value indicative of a high practicability of the successful transmission of the messages to the target computing device . A prospective transmission length within a second time range e.g. between five and ten minutes may be equated to a prospective message transmission practicability index value indicative of a moderate practicability of the successful transmission of the messages to the target computing device . A prospective transmission length within a third time range e.g. greater than ten minutes may be equated to a prospective message transmission practicability index value indicative of a low practicability of the successful transmission of the messages to the target computing device .

Operation illustrates authorizing at least in part via a cloud based architecture at least one transmission to a target device in response to a determination of a prospective message transmission practicability index. For example as shown in upon the computation of prospective transmission practicability index value associated with the received context data as described with respect to operation the message transmission server application may compare that prospective transmission practicability index associated with the received context data to a threshold transmission practicability index e.g. a threshold quantification indicative of an allowable prospective transmission length associated with e.g. mapped to in a look up table having entries for one or more computing devices the target computing device and maintained by the server data store of the server data store

Operation illustrates receiving localized context information associated with the at least one target device in response to an enqueuing of a transmission. For example as shown in a user of the computing device may employ the message creation server application to create a message for transmission to the target computing device . When the message is ready for transmission the message may be enqueued in the message storage queue . In response to the enqueuing of the message for transmission to the target computing device the message transmission server application running on the cloud based server may query one or more context sensors of a target computing device . The context sensors of a target computing device may detect a context of the target computing device and provide context data associated with such detecting to the cloud based server where it may be received by the message transmission server application .

Operation illustrates receiving localized context information associated with the at least one target device in response to an enqueuing of a threshold number of transmissions. For example as shown in a user of the computing device may employ the message creation server application to create a number of messages for transmission to the target computing device . When a message is ready for transmission the message may be enqueued in the message storage queue . Over time the message storage queue may accumulate a number of messages for transmission to the target computing device . In response to the enqueuing of a threshold number of messages for transmission to the target computing device e.g. a threshold number stored in server data store a threshold number set according to a user setting etc. the message transmission server application running on the cloud based server may query one or more context sensors of a target computing device . The context sensors of a target computing device may detect a context of the target computing device and provide context data associated with such detecting to the cloud based server where it may be received by the message transmission server application .

The inertial sensor may detect a degree of movement e.g. movement indicative of use of the target computing device by a user of the target computing device and provide context data including inertial signals to the cloud based server where it may be received by the message transmission server application .

Operation illustrates receiving one or more imaging signals associated with the at least one target device. For example as shown in a target computing device may include a image capture sensor . Upon enqueuing of a message intended for a given target computing device the message transmission server application may query the image capture sensor of the target computing device to obtain an image of the current environment of the target computing device . The image capture sensor may capture an image of the environment of the target computing device and provide context data including imaging signals to the cloud based server where it may be received by the message transmission server application . The image of the environment may be analyzed e.g. by image recognition software running on the cloud based server to determine the current environment.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware or software is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and or systems and or other technologies described herein can be effected e.g. hardware software and or firmware and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and or systems and or other technologies are deployed. For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle alternatively if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware. Hence there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and or devices and or other technologies described herein may be effected none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns e.g. speed flexibility or predictability of the implementer any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically oriented hardware software and or firmware.

Insofar as such block diagrams flowcharts and or examples contain one or more functions and or operations it will be understood by those within the art that each function and or operation within such block diagrams flowcharts or examples can be implemented individually and or collectively by a wide range of hardware software firmware or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs digital signal processors DSPs or other integrated formats. However those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein in whole or in part can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems as one or more programs running on one or more processors e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors as firmware or as virtually any combination thereof and that designing the circuitry and or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include but are not limited to the following a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk a hard disk drive a Compact Disc CD a Digital Video Disk DVD a digital tape a computer memory etc. and a transmission type medium such as a digital and or an analog communication medium e.g. a fiber optic cable a waveguide a wired communications link a wireless communication link etc. .

In a general sense those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented individually and or collectively by a wide range of hardware software firmware or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of electrical circuitry. Consequently as used herein electrical circuitry includes but is not limited to electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program e.g. a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and or devices described herein or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and or devices described herein electrical circuitry forming a memory device e.g. forms of random access memory and or electrical circuitry forming a communications device e.g. a modem communications switch or optical electrical equipment . Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and or processes in the fashion set forth herein and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and or processes into data processing systems. That is at least a portion of the devices and or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing a video display device a memory such as volatile and non volatile memory processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors computational entities such as operating systems drivers graphical user interfaces and applications programs one or more interaction devices such as a touch pad or screen and or control systems including feedback loops and control motors e.g. feedback for sensing position and or velocity control motors for moving and or adjusting components and or quantities . A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components such as those typically found in data computing communication and or network computing communication systems.

The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within or connected with different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively associated such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as associated with each other such that the desired functionality is achieved irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise any two components so associated can also be viewed as being operably connected or operably coupled to each other to achieve the desired functionality and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being operably couplable to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and or physically interacting components and or wirelessly interactable and or wirelessly interacting components and or logically interacting and or logically interactable components.

It will be understood by those within the art that in general terms used herein and especially in the appended claims e.g. bodies of the appended claims are generally intended as open terms e.g. the term including should be interpreted as including but not limited to the term having should be interpreted as having at least the term includes should be interpreted as includes but is not limited to etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example as an aid to understanding the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations. However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an e.g. a and or an should typically be interpreted to mean at least one or one or more the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.

In addition even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number e.g. the bare recitation of two recitations without other modifiers typically means at least two recitations or two or more recitations . Furthermore in those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B and C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B and C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. .

In those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B or C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B or C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms whether in the description claims or drawings should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms either of the terms or both terms. For example the phrase A or B will be understood to include the possibilities of A or B or A and B. 

While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that based upon the teachings herein changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and therefore the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.
