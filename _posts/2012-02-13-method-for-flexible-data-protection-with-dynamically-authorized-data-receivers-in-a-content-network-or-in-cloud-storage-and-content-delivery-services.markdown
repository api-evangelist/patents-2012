The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 495 866 filed Jun. 10 2011 by Xinwen Zhang et al. and entitled Method for Flexible Data Protection with Dynamically Authorized Data Receivers in a Content Network or in Cloud Storage and Content Delivery Services which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety.

An Information Centric Network ICN is a type of network architecture in which the focus is on locating and providing information to users rather than on connecting end hosts that exchange data. One type of ICN is a Content Oriented Network CON . In a CON also referred to as a Content Centric Network CCN a content router is responsible for routing user requests and content to proper recipients. In the CON a domain wide unique name is assigned to each entity that is part of a content delivery framework. The entities may comprise data content such as video clips or web pages and or infrastructure elements such as routers switches or servers. The content router uses name prefixes which can be full content names or proper prefixes of content names instead of network addresses to route content packets within the content network.

In an embodiment the disclosure includes a networking system comprising an application service that runs on a cloud infrastructure and is configured to receive dual encrypted content from a content provider and re encrypt the dual encrypted content to enable dynamic user group control for group based user authorization and a cloud storage service coupled to the application service and configured to store the dual encrypted content from the content provider and the re encrypted dual encrypted content from the application service wherein the application service and the storage service are configured to communicate and operate with a content delivery service that uses a content delivery network CDN to deliver the re encrypted content to one or more users in a group authorized by the content provider.

In another embodiment the disclosure includes an apparatus for a public cloud comprising one or more network components operating at a public cloud and comprising one or more network interfaces configured to receive a content that is dual encrypted from a publisher and stored at a storage component at the public cloud and configured to receive a request for the content from a subscriber and a processor configured to re encrypt a portion of the stored content before allowing the subscriber access to the content in response to the request via a CDN.

In another embodiment the disclosure includes a secure content publishing method implemented by a content provider coupled to a cloud service comprising encrypting with a processor a content object using a data encryption key encrypting with a processor the encrypted content object using a secret key to obtain a dual encrypted content object publishing the dual encrypted content object to the cloud service and distributing via a content delivery network CDN a group decryption key for decrypting the published content object to a plurality of users in a group.

In yet another embodiment the disclosure includes a secure content retrieving method implemented by a cloud service comprising receiving a dual encrypted content object form a publisher storing the dual encrypted content object at the cloud service receiving a request to access the stored content object from a subscriber in a group of users receiving a re encryption key from the publisher re encrypting with a processor a portion of the stored content object storing the re encrypted portion at the cloud service and delivering the stored content object including the re encrypted portion to the subscriber via a CDN.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below the disclosed systems and or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Recent advancements in Internet and information technology have revealed two significant trends. First media content may represent a significant portion of Internet traffic. For example video streaming is expected to consume approximately 90 percent of Internet traffic in the near future. Utilizing cloud computing and storage resources may also be a significant trend for enterprises and consumer oriented commercial services. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product whereby shared resources software and information may be provided to computers and other devices as a service over a network typically a public network such as the Internet. Substantially large scale content processing storage and distribution via public cloud infrastructures may be promising for quality guaranteed and cost efficient media streaming services.

Despite the increasing usage of cloud in applications and services security issues have been among a concern for cloud computing. For example how to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of outsourced content in the public cloud remains a challenging task. The security requirements may become more complex with flexible content processing and sharing among a large number of users through cloud based applications and services. The requirements may include realizing content security by the content provider that uses public cloud services e.g. instead of the cloud service provider. As such the content provider may need to encrypt associated content with keys that are out of the reach of the cloud provider. Further access control policies may need to be flexible and distinguishable among users with different privileges to access the content e.g. where each piece of content may be shared by different users or groups and users may belong to multiple groups. The requirements may also include minimizing or reducing the number of redundant copies of the content cached in the content delivery network e.g. a CON to preserve efficiency of content distribution via the network. Thus a user may earn benefits from the cache of encrypted content of other users who have the same privilege.

A cloud based content storage and delivery service e.g. where content storage processing and distribution are based on cloud computing may use a CON or another CDN infrastructure to deliver services. The services may include media and other content such as video streaming over the Internet. The CDN may be any network that provides a content caching feature. The CON infrastructure may be one type of CDN that provides the content caching feature e.g. where at least some content routers may be used to cache content in the nearest edge locations of the network to users. However the CON may also route content or data based on name prefixes e.g. instead of network addresses while other more general CDNs may comprise other types of traditional routers which may route data based on network addresses instead of prefixes. Both the CON and the other CDNs may serve as a delivery service for delivering or distributing content from the cloud to the users.

Disclosed herein is a system and method for providing a cloud based storage and delivery service that may use a CON or other CDN infrastructure for content storage and dissemination or distribution . The system and method may provide end to end publisher to subscriber content confidentiality protection by securely sharing and distributing content data via data storage and content delivery services in the cloud and CON or CDN . Secured content storage may be achieved by encrypting the content before publishing e.g. in a public network or storage places. The system may use dual encryption algorithms to encrypt content before publishing the content to the cloud. A proxy re encryption algorithm may also be used to transfer published encrypted content which may then be decrypted with updated secret keys. The encrypted content is also referred to herein as cipher content or ciphertext. To achieve flexible access control policies broadcast revocation mechanisms may be implemented to renew shared secrets keys for decrypting and hence accessing encrypted content e.g. when a user or subscriber joins or leaves a content sharing group.

The security objectives of the content or data protection system above may include ensuring content confidentiality in the cloud storage and content delivery network e.g. even under the collusion between the cloud provider and the revoked subscribers. The system may also support dynamic group based user authorization. For instance a user may choose to join or leave a group or to be revoked from a group by the content provider at any time. Only authorized users may be able to obtain the non encrypted or decrypted content also referred to herein as cleartext which may be stored in the cloud or cached in the delivery network the CON or CDN at any system state. The system may also support flexible security policies including forward and backward security. For forward security a user or subscriber may not access content that is published before the user joins a group. For backward security a user may not access content that is published after the user leaves or is revoked from a group. For forward and backward security the system may be configured to support either or both. For example a user may be allowed to access any movie that has been released before the user subscribes but may not access any content after being revoked. In another example a family content sharing application may allow a family friend to only access shared photos that are published during a determined period.

Beyond these security objectives the content or data protection system may achieve a plurality of system and network performance requirements including maintaining the efficiency of content delivery network where storing a single copy of encrypted content at each system state may be desirable for the network. The system may also support light weight end storage cost where a relatively small amount of storage may be needed at the content provider side and the subscriber side to maintain user and key management for the data protection system. The system may not substantially affect user experiences at device side and the overhead of security mechanisms may be acceptable.

The content data storage layer or plane may be implemented using a cloud infrastructure or service and may comprise a plurality of storage services and a plurality of cloud based application services . The storage services may comprise any network components or devices e.g. computers storage devices and or memory devices configured for storing data in a network or data center. The cloud based application service may be an application service that runs on a cloud infrastructure e.g. a cloud infrastructure as a service IaaS . The cloud based application services may comprise any network components or devices e.g. computers servers and or processors configured for processing data e.g. in the network or data center. The cloud based storage and delivery service system may also comprise or may be coupled to one or more content providers or publishers that publish associated content via one or more interfaces provided by the cloud based application services . The publishers may publish content data using any suitable device computer or network component such as servers personal computers PCs and or similar devices.

The cloud based application services may be configured to receive the content from the publishers and store the content in the storage services . The cloud based application services may also process the content stored in the storage services e.g. via cloud storage application programming interfaces APIs . The application services may be web like applications implemented by the content provider or publisher the cloud service provider or a third party associated with the cloud service provider that may or may not be the same party of the storage services . Similarly the storage services and content delivery network or service may or may not belong to the cloud service provider. For example Netflix may be a content provider e.g. content publisher that uses Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 and or Simple Storage Service S3 for content processing and storage while leverages multiple content delivery services such as Limelight Level 3 and or Akamai.

The content data distribution layer or plane may be implemented using a CON or CDN infrastructure and may comprise a plurality of routers . The routers may comprise content routers configured to route content data based on name prefixes and cache at least some of the routed content. The routers may also comprise other network nodes such as other types of routers bridges and or switches that may route data e.g. based on different routing schemes. For example the routers may also comprise routers that route Internet Protocol IP packets and or Ethernet packets based on network e.g. media access control MAC and or IP addresses. The content data consumption layer or plane may comprise a plurality of users or subscribers that may obtain or consume content. The subscribers may subscribe content using any suitable devices computers or network components such as desktop computers laptop computers or notebooks mobile devices e.g. smartphones and computer tablets and or similar devices.

The content data flow in the cloud based storage and delivery service system may be in the direction from the content data storage layer or plane to the content data consumption layer or plane via the content data distribution layer or plane as shown by the arrows in . The content data may be published to and stored at the content data storage layer or plane the cloud routed through and at least partially cached at the content data distribution layer or plane the CON or CDN and then delivered to the content data consumption layer or plane subscribers . To provide end to end network security and data confidentiality protection in storage and delivery via the cloud the content data may also be encrypted at cloud based storage and delivery channels the data flow channels where only authorized end users subscribers may decrypt and hence access the content.

A plurality of algorithms may be used e.g. in conjunction to achieve flexible security and efficient storage and distribution. The algorithms may be part of a data protection scheme where initially the content provider may publish encrypted content to the cloud based storage service s with a private secret or key of the publisher. The terms secret key and secret key may be used here interchangeably to refer to a secret number word code or combinations thereof that may be used in the data protection scheme of the cloud based storage and delivery service system . The provider may also publish one or more re encryption keys to the cloud based service at the content data storage layer or plane which may act as a proxy between the content provider the publisher and end users the subscribers .

The re encryption keys may be generated upon events of user joining leaving or actively being revoked by the content provider. When a request from a content subscriber is received at the cloud and or the CON CDN the cloud based proxy service may verify whether the content stored in the cloud storage services is encrypted with the latest re encryption key from the content publisher . If this condition is true then the content may be downloaded via a content delivery service interface the data flow channels . Otherwise the proxy service may invalidate any encrypted form of the target data the requested content via the delivery service re encrypt the content with the latest re encryption key from the publisher and then authorize the access. As such there may be a single cipher or encrypted copy of the content stored in cloud storage storage services and the delivery network the CON CDN may serve content that is encrypted with the latest re encryption key. Access control may be enforced by distributing a shared secret key to authorized users subscribers with which re encrypted content may be decrypted.

The data protection scheme in the cloud based storage and delivery service system may also separate the distribution of the shared key from that of the content private publisher key and re encryption keys. Specifically the data protection scheme may enforce flexible authorization policies where only authorized users subscribers may obtain the shared secret key and the content provider may maintain substantial control over issuing new keys whenever needed. The data protection scheme may also leverage broadcast of revocation mechanisms to renew the shared secret key to achieve scalability.

The data protection scheme may be an end to end data protection scheme that trusts the content provider publishers and consumers subscribers . For instance a content rendering application or agent running on the subscriber s device may be trusted. The application or agent may not release the content decryption key and any decrypted content also referred to herein as clear content to unauthorized parties. The application or agent on the subscriber s device may remove or delete the decryption key when the subscriber leaves a group or is revoked by the content provider. The data protection scheme may also consider that the cloud service provider is honest but may be curious about the content. For example the cloud service provider may follow and abide by the protocols and operations for storing delivering and or encrypting decrypting content but may also actively try to obtain unauthorized clear content. The data protection scheme may account for the case where the cloud infrastructure hardware and or software is exploited by attackers and or stored content is exposed. Further the scheme may be used where the content delivery service e.g. the CON CDN is semi trusted. For example the content delivery service may be curious to sniff content that is distributed and or cached in the network but may honestly perform the protocols and operations described herein and satisfy the quality of services that may be specified in service level agreements SLAs between the content provider or publisher and the delivery service provider the CON CDN provider .

The cloud may be a service provided by a cloud provider. The cloud provider may provide public cloud services such as a storage service for content storing and a content delivery service for content distribution. The cloud provider may also provide virtual infrastructure to host application services. The application service may be used by the content provider to handle encrypt and store content in the cloud and or by the content subscribers or consumers to retrieve and decrypt the content. The content provider may provide content to one or more groups of subscribers e.g. the consumers and may also provide user management of the groups. The content provider may use a cloud service from the cloud provider to store and distribute content. The subscribers or consumers may be able to access the content stored in the cloud via the CON CDN e.g. if the consumers successfully subscribe to the content provider . The consumers may decrypt the delivered content and hence consume or use the content e.g. using local software.

Specifically the application service in the cloud may allow via the web interface and or APIs a content provider to publish and manipulate content stored in the cloud and may also allow the consumers to retrieve or request content. The cloud storage service may interact with the application service to store and provide the content stored in the cloud . The content delivery service may interact with the cloud storage service to download or forward the content from the cloud to the consumers . In some embodiments the content delivery service may also interact with the cloud storage service to upload or publish the content from the content provider to the cloud .

To protect the content stored in the public cloud from being accessed by unauthorized parties or users the data protection scheme may provide a plurality of cryptographic tools for the content provider to ensure that only authorized subscribers may be able to obtain the decryption keys and hence decrypt the published or stored cipher content. Initially the content provider may pre process cleartext or clear content locally by calling an encryption Enc function and may then publish the processed content to the public cloud storage service e.g. at the storage components or devices . The Enc function may perform dual encryption on the content. The dual encryption may be any two level encryption that performs a first encryption scheme on the content to obtain a first level encrypted content and then performs a second encryption scheme on the first level encrypted content to obtain a second level encrypted content. For instance the Enc function may perform dual encryption on the content with symmetric encryption as the first level of encryption and then a proxy based encryption as the second level of encryption. The dual encryption scheme may enable the data protection scheme to protect content confidentiality and to outsource flexible access control policies.

To delegate different access control mechanisms the content provider may distribute corresponding re encryption keys rk to the application service in the cloud . The application service may transform the ciphertext encrypted content in the cloud by calling a re encryption Re Enc function with rk so that subscribers the consumers may decrypt the content with a shared secret key uk between the content provider and the consumers . When a change or an update incident occurs in the user group the consumers e.g. when a user joins or leaves the group the content provider may update the content re encryption key rk that may be stored in the application service to invalidate any previous version of the encrypted content.

To update the content re encryption key the content provider may implement a re encryption key Re Key function that generates a new delegation key for the application service. Hence the application service may produce a new ciphertext for the content by implementing Re Enc on the original cipher content in the cloud with the new re encryption key rk. A relatively small part of the resulting new cipher content may be stored in the cloud storage service and the main part e.g. a remaining part of the cipher content may be cached in the delivery network the CON CDN to accelerate content distribution. During the re encryption process a relatively small part of the ciphertext of the content may require updating. The main part of the content may remain unchanged and may be kept cached within the delivery network. When accessing a content object a client a consumer may have to obtain all parts of the content from the cloud and the distribution network the CON CDN in order to decrypt and render the content. This feature may achieve at least some of the security objectives above and efficient content distribution.

The data protection scheme may apply a dual encryption scheme to protect content confidentiality and may also bridge a proxy based re encryption scheme and a secret sharing scheme. A proxy based re encryption scheme may be used as described by Giuseppe Ateniese et al. and entitled Improved Proxy Re encryption Schemes with Applications to Secure Distributed Storage in the Association for Computing Machinery ACM Transactions on Information and System Security 9 1 30 February 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference. A secret sharing scheme may also be used as described by M. Naor et al. and entitled Efficient Trace and Revoke Schemes in Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Financial Cryptography 2001 which is incorporated herein by reference. Table 1 shows the notations used in the description of the operations and algorithms below. More details about the operations and algorithms may be described by Huijun Xiong et al. and entitled Towards End to End Secure Content Storage and Delivery with Public Cloud in ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy CODASPY 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety.

The data protection scheme above may comprise a system setup state or operation which may be implemented by the content provider to prepare the cryptographic system for content encryption and re encryption. The content provider may first choose a plurality of system public parameters params which may include g G and a bilinear map. The parameter G is a multiplicative cyclic group as described by Huijun Xiong et al. and g is a value selected from G. The bilinear map may be used as described by D. Boneh et al. in Identity based Encryption from the Weil Pairing in the International Association for Cryptologic Research conference CRYPTO 2001 and by D. Boneh et al. in Short Signatures from the Weil Pairing in the Advances in Cryptology Proceedings of conference ASIACRYPT 2001 both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The content provider may also choose a proxy secret key SK Zand a public key PK g G where Zis a set of values of order r as described by Huijun Xiong et al. The content provider may keep SK secret and may choose an integer k and a list L of polynomials of degree k 1 with coefficients randomly chosen from Z which may be kept secret. The number of users or consumers who may be revoked at about the same time may be k 1. The content provider may then choose a random number from Zas the initial group secret key uk. The system setup operation may be performed by the content provider for each group of users.

The data protection scheme may comprise a content publishing state or operation which may be implemented by the content provider to publish content to the public cloud. The content provider may perform a dual encryption scheme as follows where the content provider may encrypt the content M with a symmetric data encryption key DEK to produce a ciphertext C M DEK . The content provider may then further encrypt the content C M DEK with the secret key SK and the params as shown in Algorithm 1 in Table 2 below. The resulting encrypted content may have about three components u w v which may be stored in the cloud based storage service by the application service via cloud APIs. The component umay depend on a random secret h and the content provider s secret key SK The first content component w may depend on the random secret h and the data encryption key DEK. The second content component v may depend on both h and the original content. Typically uand w may be substantially smaller in data size than v.

The data protection scheme may comprise a content retrieving state or operation which may be implemented when the subscribers or consumers may access content that may be stored in the cloud. This operation may comprise the Re Key and Re Enc functions or algorithms. Using the Re Key algorithm the content provider may generate a content re encryption key rkwith the content provider s secret key SK and the current decryption key uk. Details of the Re Key algorithm are shown in Algorithm 2 in Table 3 below.

After this the application service may store the cipher content u w v in the cloud storage service and allow the download. For each cipher content w and v may be cached in the content delivery network while umay not be cached. Since the size of uis relatively small to the remaining content components this operation may not affect the efficiency of content delivery. When the system state is changed e.g. a user joins or leaves or is revoked from the group the shared secret key may be updated from uk to uk . When the new secret key is updated to authorized users the content provider may generate the re encryption key re key rkby implementing the Re Key algorithm and send the re key to the application service for content re encryption with the Re Enc algorithm. The new cipher content is referred to as u w v . The user may then download u from the cloud storage and w and v from the content delivery network.

After the user obtains the encrypted content u w v the user may implement Algorithm 4 in Table 5 below to decrypt the cipher with the user s current secret key uk. The user may either obtain the secret key uk from the content provider when the user first joins or may compute the secret key.

As described above the data protection scheme may integrate symmetric encryption and proxy based re encryption e.g. in a seamless manner to the content providers consumers. The algorithms above may allow caching a substantial portion of a stored cipher content object in the delivery network for content distribution e.g. the CON CDN while keeping a smaller or minor part in the cloud storage for key management. The confidentiality oriented proxy based re encryption policies may enable flexible and scalable deployment and provide improved or stronger security for cached content in the network.

At block the application service may re encrypt a portion uin a target cipher content u w v using the content re encryption key rkand a re encryption Re Enc algorithm. At block the application service may store a resulting deliverable target cipher content u w v in a cloud storage service. For each published content two buckets or copies may be created one for the originally published cipher content u w v from the content provider which may not be updated once stored and the other for the cipher content u w v to be delivered to the user or subscriber which may be updated once a user joins or leaves the user group. Although both buckets may be made publicly readable to users the original published one may be set private permission since only the content provider and the application service may need to access this bucket. The other content bucket may be publicly readable to all authorized users in the user group. To avoid storage redundancy only uof the cipher content may be stored in a cloud storage service as the other part w v is the same as the public bucket. The upart may be substantially smaller for example may be stored in EC2 to facilitate the cryptographic operations.

At block the parts w and v may be cached in cloud delivery service e.g. the CON CDN as suitable. The parts w and v may be cached in at least some of the content routers in the CON CDN that may be along the data flow of the downloaded content from the cloud to the user or subscriber. The parts w and v may not be cached a second time if the parts were previously cached at the content routers. The user or subscriber may then receive the target cipher content u w v and use the group secret decryption key uk to decrypt the context and obtain clear content. At block the application service or the content publisher may determine whether a user has joined left or been revoked from the user group. If the condition in block is true then the method may proceed to block . Otherwise the method may end. At block the application service may receive an updated group secret decryption key uk from the content provider. At block the application service may receive a new re key rk from the content provider generated using Re Key. At block the application service may re encrypt a portion uof the target cipher content u w v to obtain an updated cipher content u w v using the new re key rk and Re Enc. The method may then end.

The content aware unit may also comprise a programmable content forwarding plane block and one or more storage blocks that may be coupled to the programmable content forwarding plane block . The programmable content forwarding plane block may be configured to implement content forwarding and processing functions such as at an application layer or L3 where the content may be forwarded based on content name or prefix and possibly other content related information that maps the content to network traffic. Such mapping information may be maintained in a content table at the content aware unit or the network unit . The programmable content forwarding plane block may interpret user requests for content and accordingly fetch content e.g. based on meta data and or content name from the network or other content routers and may store the content e.g. temporarily in the storage blocks . The programmable content forwarding plane block may then forward the cached content to the user. The programmable content forwarding plane block may be implemented using software hardware or both and may operate above the IP layer or L2. The storage blocks may comprise a cache for temporarily storing content such as content that is requested by a subscriber. Additionally the storage blocks may comprise a long term storage for storing content relatively longer such as content submitted by a publisher. For instance the cache and the long term storage may include Dynamic random access memories DRAMs solid state drives SSDs hard disks or combinations thereof.

The network components and devices described above may be implemented on any general purpose network component such as a computer or network component with sufficient processing power memory resources and network throughput capability to handle the necessary workload placed upon it. illustrates a typical general purpose network component suitable for implementing one or more embodiments of the components disclosed herein. The network component includes a processor which may be referred to as a central processor unit or CPU that is in communication with memory devices including secondary storage read only memory ROM random access memory RAM input output devices and network connectivity devices . The processor may be implemented as one or more CPU chips or may be part of one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs .

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs that are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data that are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device that typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage .
