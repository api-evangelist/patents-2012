This invention was made with government support under contract no. R01CA 119412 awarded by the National. Cancer Institute. The government has certain rights in the invention.

A field of the invention is gold nanoparticles. Example applications of the invention include medical diagnostics and medical therapies. Non medical applications include sensors and electronic materials. Gold nanoparticles find use as therapeutic agents sensors electronic materials and coatings on biological and non biological surfaces.

Nanomedicine is an emerging area of medicine that utilizes nanoparticles for the detection and treatment of various diseases and disorders. Nanoparticles are tiny fragments of metals or non metals that are 100 000 times smaller than the width of human hair. Nanoparticles typically have different properties than naturally occurring bulk materials. Collateral properties emanate when materials especially metals are reduced to dimensions measured in nanometers. Nanoparticles exhibit properties that are unique from their corresponding naturally occurring bulk material.

Nanoparticles within the size range of about 1 50 nanometers have a size that can be correlated to cells viruses proteins and antibodies. The size resemblance that such nanoparticles have to living cells and cell components are of great interest to medical research because cells are primary components of all life humans and animals .

Gold nanoparticles have a number of important potential medical applications. One application is hyperthermia treatment in which gold nanoparticles are heated with oscillating magnetic fields after being associated with a targeted cell typically cancer cells. Other applications relate to biological imaging as gold nanoparticles display photo absorbance or emission characteristics that can be used in imaging for the diagnosis of various diseases. Contrast enhancement is also provided by gold nanoparticles. For example the selective absorption of X rays by gold and other metallic nanoparticles provides measurable contrasts for use in computer tomographic CT imaging and other imaging techniques These and other important diagnostic and therapeutic properties are attainable only when metallic or non metallic materials are reduced to nanometer particle sizes.

Gold nanoparticles have unique properties that make them more attractive than other nanoparticles for many therapeutic imaging and sensing applications and particularly in medical applications. Gold nanoparticles have an unoxidized state whereas most of the surface of less noble metals get oxidized to a depth of several nanometers or more often significantly reducing or obliterating the nanoscale properties of the nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are highly reactive but biocompatible making them especially well suited for in vivo imaging and therapy. Gold nanoparticles can also be coated with specific biomolecules including monoclonal antibodies aptamers peptides and various receptor specific substrates. Receptor specific coated nanoparticles are used mainly for targeting three different markers that are over expressed on cancer cells. They include matrix metalloproteases epidermal growth factor receptor and oncoproteins that are associated with human papillomavirus infection.

For such in vivo imaging and therapy applications it is that gold nanoparticles be produced stabilized in a biologically benign medium. Many current methods of producing gold nanoparticles require the removal of unreacted chemicals and byproducts from the nanoparticles as the chemicals and byproducts are necessary to the synthesis of the gold nanoparticles. The chemicals and byproducts must be removed after the production of nanoparticles to make the nanoparticles biocompatible.

Typical known methods of making nanoparticles utilize harsh conditions such as the application of sodium borohydride to reduce AuCl. See e.g. M. Brust et al Synthesis of Thiol Derivatized Gold Nanoparticles in a 2 Phase Liquid Liquid System Journal of the Chemical Society Chemical Communications 7 80 02 1994 . The method provides for the efficient production of gold nanoparticle but is unsuitable in the presence of target specific peptides because sodium borohydride will reduce chemical functionalities present on peptide backbones which can reduce or eliminate the biospecificity of biomolecules. The sodium borohydride reduction method also uses thiols to stabilize the gold nanoparticles from agglomeration. Thiol gold nanoparticle interaction is strong and makes gold nanoparticles highly stable. Once the gold nanoparticles are stabilized by thiols they cannot be readily transferred onto useful drug moieties including peptides proteins and various biochemical vectors that are normally used to target diagnostic and therapeutic gold nanoparticles on to tumor and various disease sites in the body. Other methods that have been developed utilize chemical cocktails during nanoparticle production and are not environmentally friendly in additional to having the drawbacks concerning stabilization reactivity and biocompatibility.

The invention provides stabilized biocompatible gold nanoparticles that are stabilized with material from polyphenols or flavanoids rich plant material or reactive phytochemical components of the plant material. The gold nanoparticles of the invention can be fabricated with an environmentally friendly method for making biocompatible stabilized gold nanoparticles. In preferred embodiments the coating consists of material from polyphenols or flavanoids rich plant material or reactive phytochemical components of the plant material.

A method of sensing or therapy of the invention comprises introducing stabilized biocompatible gold nanoparticles of the invention into a human or animal subject and conducting gold nanoparticle enhanced imaging or gold nanoparticle enhanced therapy.

Fabrication methods of the invention require only gold salts as precursors. No other man made chemicals are employed in the overall fabrication process and there are accordingly no harsh chemicals utilized in the fabrication or harsh byproducts formed during the fabrication.

The entire process can be conducted at room temperature in a reasonable period of a time. The process can also be expedited by heating such as by heating with microwaves.

Preferably the black tea turmeric curcumin or cinnamon or similar naturally occurring polyphenols or flavanoids rich plant material is a powder. Stabilized biocompatible gold nanoparticles are separated 28 from the reaction mixture by passing the reaction mixture through filter paper to remove the plant materials. The black tea turmeric curcumin or cinnamon or similar naturally occurring polyphenols or flavanoids rich plant material is preferably non roasted. Powder or roots forms of turmeric can be used. Similarly powder or bark chunk forms of cinnamon can be used.

Preferred gold salts used in methods of the invention are either sodium tetrachloaurate or aurochloric acid with naturally available black tea turmeric curcumin or cinnamon.

About 16 000 cells were plated into each well in a 6 well plate and this plate was incubated at 37 C. for 18.0 20.0 hrs to allow the cells to recover. After the cells were recovered the media from each well was aspirated and fresh growth media was added about 4 mL per each well .

Note 25 stabilized gold nanoparticles solution is made up with the media itself . After adding the sample plate was incubated for 4 h at 37 C. Media was aspirated from each well after 4 h and the cell layer was rinsed with CMFH EDTA Calcium Magnesium Free Hark s HEPES EDTA solution to remove all traces of serum which contains trypsin inhibitor. About 0.5 mL of Trypsin EDTA solution was added to each well and cells were observed under an inverted microscope until cell layer is dispersed. 4.0 mL of complete growth medium was added to each well and cells were aspirated by gently pipetting.

MTT Cell Proliferation Assay kit was obtained from ATCC. For the cytotoxicity evaluation of these nanoparticles MTT assay was done as described by supplier. Briefly 1 10cells ml cells at the exponential growth phase were taken in a flat bottomed 96 well polystyrene coated plate and were incubated for 24 h in COincubator at 5 COand 37 C. Series of dilutions like 10 25 50 100 and 150 M of T AuNP 1 were made in the medium. Each concentration was added to the plate in quadruplet manner. After 24 h of incubation 10 l well MTT stock solution 5 mg ml PBS was added for 6 h and formazan crystals so formed were dissolved in 100 l detergent. The plates were read in a microplate reader Dynastic MR 5000 USA operating at 570 nm. Wells with complete medium nanoparticles and MTT but without cells were used as blanks.

Absorption measurements indicated that the plasmon resonance wavelength of various T AuNPs is 535 nm. The sizes of T AuNPs are in the range of 15 42 nm as measured from TEM techniques The phenolics and other phytochemicals within tea not only result in effective reduction of gold salts to their corresponding nanoparticles but their chemical framework wrap around the stabilized gold nanoparticles to provide excellent robustness against agglomeration.

TEM measurements on T AuNPs 1 4 show that particles are spherical in shape within the size range of 16 35 nm. Size distribution analysis of T AuNPs confirm that particles are mono disperse. DCS technique measures size of the nanoparticle by determining the time required for nanoparticles to traverse a sucrose density gradient created in a disc centrifuge. Both the techniques TEM and DCS provide sizes of metallic gold cores. Gold nanoparticulate sizes measured by TEM and DCS were in good agreement and are in the range 16 35 nm. Dynamic light scattering was employed to calculate the size of gold coated with phytochemicals hydrodynamic radius . The tea phytochemicals coatings on stabilized gold nanoparticles are expected to cause substantial changes in the hydrodynamic radius of T AuNPs. Hydrodynamic diameter of T AuNP 1 and T AuNP 2 as determined from DLS measurements gave a values of 105 1 and 165 1 respectively suggesting that tea phytochemicals catechins theaflavins and thearibigins are capped on stabilized gold nanoparticles. The measurement of charge on nanoparticles Zeta Potential provides crucial information on the stability of the nanoparticle dispersion. The magnitude of the measured zeta potential is an indication of the repulsive forces that are present and can be used to predict the long term stability of the nanoparticulate dispersion. The stability of nanoparticulate dispersion depends upon the balance of the repulsive and attractive forces that exist between nanoparticles as they approach one another. If all the particles have a mutual repulsion then the dispersion will remain stable. However little or no repulsion between particles lead to aggregation. Negative zeta potential of 32 1 and 25 1 for T AuNP 1 and T AuNP 2 indicates that the particles repel each other and there is no tendency for the particles to aggregate.

Synthetic conditions have been optimized for the quantitative large scale conversions of NaAuClto the corresponding AuNPs using tea leaves. The nature and chemical roles of different phytochemicals in tea leaves for the production of T AuNPs are summarized in the following sections. The main phytochemicals present in black tea leaves consist of water soluble Catechins Catechin Epicatechin Epicatechin gallate Epigallocatechin Epigallocatechin gallate etc. Theaflavins Theaflavin Theaflavin 3 gallate Theaflavin 3 gal late Theaflavin 3 3 gallate etc. and Thearubigins which are oligomers of catechins of unknown structure. Generation of T AuNPS using tea leaves involves aqueous media. Experiments have systematically investigated the roles of catechins and theaflavins for the generation and stabilization of AuNPs.

The series of independent experiments for the generation of stabilized gold nanoparticles using commercially available catechins Catechin Epicatechin Epicatechin gallate Catechin gallate Epigallocatechin Epigallocatechin gallate provide the necessary information to confirm that catechins are excellent reducing and stabilizing agents to reduce Au III to stabilized gold nanoparticles. The reactions went to completion within 30 min. Absorption measurements indicated that the plasmon resonance wavelength T AuNPs are 530 nm. The size of the T AuNPs is found to be 15 52 nm as measured from the TEM images. The gold nanoparticles obtained using catechin and epigallocatechin gallate EGCG showed excellent stability which was conformed by their in vitro stability studies. The stabilized gold nanoparticles obtained using epigallocatechin and epicatechin showed minimum stability thus generating the formation of brown suspensions. To further investigate the reduction potential of all the catechins the formation of stabilized gold nanoparticles using gum Arabic a glyco protein as stabilizer was also tested. The experiments revealed that all the catechins Catechin Epicatechin Epicatechin gallate Epigallocatechin Catechin gallate Epigallocatechin gallate act as excellent reducing agents to reduce the Au III to stabilized gold nanoparticles. The nanoparticles thus generated showed improved stability against various salts and serum proteins. The experiments unambiguously uncover that catechin and epigallocatechin gallate EGCG have excellent reducing and stabilizing capabilities to reduce and stabilize the stabilized gold nanoparticle.

The role of theaflavins in the generation of stabilized gold nanoparticles was also investigated. The tea extract in these experiments was from Sigma Aldrich and contained 80 theaflavins. Addition of aqueous solution of NaAuClto the theaflavin aqueous solution at 25 C. resulted in the formation of purple colored solutions within 30 minutes. The stabilized gold nanoparticles thus obtained by using theaflavin were characterized by UV Vis absorption spectroscopy and TEM. Plasmon resonance band at 535 nm indicated the formation of stabilized gold nanoparticles. TEM measurements confirmed the size distribution of stabilized gold nanoparticles. Detailed in vitro stabilities of the stabilized gold nanoparticles confirmed that the nanoparticles are extremely stable under various conditions. These results convincingly demonstrate the reducing and stabilizing capabilities of mixture of theaflavins. The determination of unambiguous roles of catechins and theaflavins will find applications in careful design of tumor specific imaging modalities.

The reservoir of non toxic phytochemicals in tea serves as a source of non toxic reducing agents with capabilities for in vivo administrations in situations that require generation of stabilized gold nanoparticles under in vivo conditions. The approach to gold nanoparticulate synthesis in the various tea experiments provides a universally applicable generalized synthetic route using phytochemicals available in tea and can provide for the fabrication of a library of stabilized gold nanoparticles with various non toxic bioconjugates. One such example has been explored via the utilization of gum Arabic GA a commonly used non toxic food additive. The example use of gum Arabic protein shows that bioconjugates can be used as a green platform to achieve excellent control over size and shape of nanoparticles.

The additional envirofriendly component in the form of gum Arabic also provides additional advantages. The use of gum Arabic along with Tea leaves resulted in an increase in the optical density absorbance in the UV Vis spectra of reaction mixtures. This observation demonstrates that gum Arabic is likely serving as a biochemical platform to drive such reactions to completion with consequent production of well defined and uniform spherical stabilized gold nanoparticles. The effect of temperature on the formation of stabilized gold nanoparticles revealed that nanoparticle formation at elevated temperatures results in a randomly distributed spherical stabilized gold nanoparticles of sizes varying from 15 30 nm.

An issue of critical importance for in vivo imaging applications is the stability of AuNPs over a reasonable time period. The stability of T AuNPs evaluated by monitoring the plasmon max in 0.5 Cysteine 0.2 M Histidine 0.5 Human Serum Albumin HSA 0.5 Bovine Serum Albumin BSA or 5 NaCl solutions were evaluate over 30 min. The stability of T AuNPs in pH 5 7 and pH 9 phosphate buffer solutions was also tested. The plasmon wavelength in all the above formulations shifts 1 5 nm showing that the AuNPs are intact and that they demonstrate excellent in vitro stability in biological fluids at physiological pH

For biomedical applications that require lower concentrations of AuNPs it is vitally important that dilutions of AuNP solutions do not alter their characteristic chemical and photophysical properties. The effect of dilution on the stability of T AuNPs under dilution was measured. Specifically the plasmon resonance wavelength max was monitored after successive addition of 0.1 mL of doubly ionized DI water to 1 mL of AuNP solutions. The absorption intensity at max was found to be linearly dependent on the concentration of AuNPs in accordance with Beer Lambert s law. The max of AuNPs did not change at very dilute conditions.

Cellular internalization studies was studied via incubation of aliquots of T AuNPs with cancer cells. TEM images of prostate PC 3 and breast tumor MCF 7 cells post treated with T AuNPs showed significant internalization of nanoparticles via endocytosis within the MCF 7 and PC 3 cells. The internalization of nanoparticles within cells could occur via processes including phagocytosis fluid phase endocytosis and receptor mediated endocytosis. The viability of both PC 3 and MCF 7 cells post internalization of T AuNPs suggests that the phytochemical coating renders the nanoparticles to be non toxic to cells. Such internalization of stabilized gold nanoparticles keeping the cellular machinery intact provides new opportunities for probing cellular processes via nanoparticulate mediated imaging.

The cytotoxicity of T AuNPs under in vitro conditions in Prostate PC 3 and Breast MCF 7 cancer cells were examined in terms of the effect of stabilized gold nanoparticles on cell proliferation by the MTT assay. Untreated cells as well as cells treated with 10 25 50 100 and 150 M concentrations of stabilized gold nanoparticles for 24 h were subjected to the MTT assay for cell viability determination. In this assay only cells that are viable after 24 h exposure to the sample are capable to metabolize a dye 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide efficiently and produce a purple coloured precipitate which is dissolved in a detergent and analyzed sphectrophotometrically. After 24 h of post treatment PC 3 MCF 7 cells showed excellent viability even up to 150 M concentrations of T AuNP These results demonstrate that the phytochemicals within tea provide a non toxic coating on stabilized gold nanoparticles and corroborate the results as seen in the internalization studies discussed above. It is also important to recognize that a vast majority of Gold I and Gold III compounds exhibit varying degrees of cytotoxicity to a variety of cells. The lack of any noticeable toxicity of T AuNPs provides new opportunities for the safe delivery and applications of such nanoparticles in molecular imaging and therapy.

Additional Characterization and Testing of Cinnamon Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles Fabricated at Various Conditions

For additional characterization of cinnamon stabilized gold nanoparticles NaAuClwas purchased from Alfa Aesar. Trans cinnamaldehyde eugenol cinnamyl acetate cinnamyl alcohol linalool terpinene R Limonene eugenyl acetate linalyl acetate catechin epicatechin were purchased from Sigma St. Louis Mo. . All cell culture materials e.g. minimum essential medium MEM with nonessential amino acids powdered HEPES bovine insulin streptomycin sulfate penicillin G were obtained from Sigma St. Louis Mo. . Bovine calf serum phenol red sodium salt and lyophilized trypsin were obtained from Gibco BRL Grand Island N.Y. .

To a 20 mL vial was added 6 mL of doubly ionized DI water followed by the addition of 25 mg of cinnamon. The mixture was stirred continuously at 25 C. for 5 min. To the stirring mixture was added 100 L of 0.1 M NaAuClsolution in DI water . The color of the mixture turned purple within 20 minutes after the addition of NaAuClindicating the formation of gold nanoparticles. The reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 10 minutes. The gold nanoparticle solution was separated from the residual cinnamon powder by means of a standard paper filter. The solution was further filtered through a 0.5 micron filter. Finally the gold nanoparticles were characterized by UV Vis absorption spectroscopy and TEM analysis.

Attempted synthesis of gold nanoparticles from NaAuClwas done with each of major components present in cinnamon as phytochemicals. Except linalool and catechin compounds all other components have failed to produce nanoparticles by reducing NaAuCl. Starch present as carbohydrate 80 90 in cinnamon is used to stabilize the gold nanoparticles during the reduction process. The procedure of making gold nanoparticles by linalool and catechin compounds in starch is as follows To a 20 mL vial was added 6 mL of doubly ionized DI water followed by the addition of 22.5 mg of starch. The mixture was stirred continuously at 80 C. for 10 min. After dissolving the starch the solution was cooled down to 30 C. with continuous stirring at room temperature. To this solution was added 10 mg of linalool or 5 mg catechin or 5 mg epicatechin followed by 100 L of 0.1M NaAuClsolution in DI water . The color of the mixture turned purple red within 30 minutes after the addition of NaAuClindicating the formation of gold nanoparticles. The solution was finally characterized by UV Vis absorption spectroscopy and TEM analysis.

In vitro stability studies were performed by mixing gold nanoparticles to aqueous solutions of 10 NaCl 0.5 cysteine 0.2 M histidine 0.5 HAS and 0.5 BSA. The stability of the conjugates was measured by monitoring the UV absorbance over the periods 30 min 2 hrs and 7 days. A negligible change in plasmon band was observed in UV which confirmed the retention of nanoparticulate composition in all of the mixtures. TEM studies also inferred the stability of the nanoparticles in all of the in vitro studies.

Human fibroblasts primary cultures were obtained from the Bond Life Science Centre at University of Missouri Columbia. Fibroblast cells were maintained in DMEM with 10 pgmLphenol red 10 mM HEPES 100 units mLpenicillin 100 pgmLstreptomycin and 10 donor bovine serum maintenance medium .

In Vitro Cytotoxicity measurements MTT Assay of Cinnamon Cinnamon Component Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles.

The in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of cinnamon stabilized gold nanoparticles was performed as described by the supplier ATCC USA . Briefly 2 10fibroblasts cells at the exponential growth phase were seeded in each well of a flat bottomed 96 well polystyrene coated plate and were incubated at 37 C. for 24 h in COincubator at 5 COenvironment. Series of dilutions like 25 50 125 and 165 M gold atoms of these nanoparticles were made in the medium. Each concentration was added to the plate in pentaplet manner. After 24 h incubation 10 L per well MTT stock solution 5 mgmLPBS ATCC USA was added for 24 h and formosan crystals so formed were dissolved in 100 L detergent. The plates were kept for 18 h in dark at 25 C. to dissolve all the crystals and the intensity of developed color was measured by micro plate reader Dynastic MR 5000 USA operating at 570 nm wavelength. Wells with complete medium nanoparticles and MTT but without cells were used as blanks. Untreated cells were considered 100 viable.

MCF 7 breast cancer and PC 3 prostate cancer cells obtained from ATCC were used for the in vitro cell internalization analyses. MCF 7 cells were maintained in MEM with nonessential amino acids 10 pg ml phenol red 10 mM HEPES 6 ng ml insulin 100 units ml penicillin 100 pg ml streptomycin and 10 FBS maintenance medium . PC 3 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 4.5 g L D glucose 25 mM HEPES 0.11 g L sodium pyruvate 1.5 g L sodium bi carbonate 2 mM L glutamine and 10 FBS and antibiotics. Known concentration of cinnamon stabilized gold nanoparticles 100 mL were added to each type of cells 10000 cells and incubated for 4 h at 37 C. Following incubation cells were washed three times with PBS centrifuged into small pellets and fixed with 2 glutaraldehyde 2 paraformaldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1M . The cells were further fixed with 1 buffered osmium tetraoxide and dehydrated in an ethanol series before embedding in Epon Spurr epoxy resin. Sections 75 85 nm were cut using Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome and placed on a TEM grid. The sections were post stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for organelle visualization. The prepared samples were viewed with JEOL 1400 Transmission Electron Microscope.

The biodistribution of Cin AuNPs were assessed in two groups of TRAMP mice weighing 20 g. The measurements were done by considering the amount of gold in various organs using AAS. For each time point the animals were intravenously injected though tail with Cin AuNP 200 L 3.75 mg mL and sacrificed after 4 h and 24 h time periods. The amount of gold in blood brain heart kidney muscle pancreas tumor spleen lung liver and tail were determined to assess the tissue affinity for Cin AuNPs. After 4 h of dosing the average gold concentrations were negligible in blood brain heart kidney muscle pancreas and tumor while a very small amount of gold was observed in liver 65.0 77.0 g g of tissue and tail 28.0 31.0 g g of tissue . The highest gold concentration was observed in lung 482.0 g g of tissue . At 24 h after dosing the gold concentrations remaining in the lung were not significantly different from those after 4 h which suggests a good affinity of the AuNPs for lung tissues.

Tissues were removed from 80 C. storage and allowed to partially thaw. Following partial thawing whole tissue samples were placed in a 15 ml clean graduated centrifuge tube with concentrated trace metal grade nitric acid Fisher Scientific and concentrated trace metal grade hydrochloric acid in 1 2 ratio and heated in an oven to 85 C. overnight 12 18 hr . The amount of acid depended on the weight of the tissue and the proportion used was 1 mg tissue 1 L HNO 0.5 L HCl . After cooling the digest was diluted in 1 10 ratio with ultra pure water for analysis. The mouse carcasses were homogenized by grinding into a fine powder using a stein mill and then 1 g aliquots were digested and analyzed with the method described for the other mouse tissues.

AAS Analysis. All the samples were analyzed by furnace AAS using a standard curve spanning 0 100 micro grams L. The furnace parameters were as specified in the user s manual for the Perkin Elmer Analyst 800 ThGA graphite furnace. Quality control materials duplicates spikes and instrument calibration verification were within appropriate ranges.

A Gammex RMI Model 461 phantom was scanned using a Siemens volume zoom CT system. Five 5.0 mL glass vials containing aqueous solutions of various concentrations of Cin AuNPs were placed in holders in the phantom. This arrangement presented a tissue like solid water background with Cin AuNP contrast inclusions. Scans were performed at tube voltages of 80 and 140 kVp at the same level in the phantom. Images were reconstructed in 4 mm thick slices with a field of view of 208 mm. Evaluation of the contrast enhancement contribution of Cin AuNPs was carried out by loading the digital CT images in a standard display program and then selecting a region of interest on the resultant CT image for each sample and the background. Contrast enhancement was determined in HU for each mass concentration of Cin AuNPs and each tube voltage.

The cinnamon stabilized gold nanoparticles Cin AuNP were prepared by simple mixing of an aqueous solution of commercially available sodium tetrachloroaurate with cinnamon present in DI water. The reaction produced a purple red color solution within 25 minutes at room temperature stirring. The absorbance profile revealed ad plasmon resonance wavelength that appeared at 540 nm. Other physicochemical properties such as size charge and morphology of Cin AuNPs were determined by transmission electron microscopy TEM differential centrifugal sedimentation DCS Disc Centrifuge CPS Instruments and dynamic light scattering DLS . TEM and CPS were used to determine the core size of while DLS was used to evaluate the hydrodynamic size of phytochemicals coated gold nanoparticles. The TEM images showed the size and shape of the nanoparticles to be homogeneous with an average diameter of 13 5 nm and a narrow size distribution. As expected the hydrodynamic size of cinnamon coated gold nanoparticles is greater than the core size measured by TEM and CPS. The negative zeta potential value 31.0 mV was determined for the Cin AuNPs which provides the necessary repulsive forces for the particles to remain stable in solution.

The main phytochemicals present in cinnamon consist of essential oil trans cinnamaldehyde eugenol linalool trans cinnamic acid terpenes and others 1 4 by weight polyphenols catechin epicatechin anthocyanidin catecin epicatechin oligomers kaempferitrin and others 5 10 by weight and carbohydrates starch polysaccharides ash 80 90 by weight . The phenolic compounds are known as potent antioxidants and thus may play a major role in the overall reduction of NaAuCl. The systematically investigation revealed the roles of these phytochemicals for the generation and stabilization of AuNPs by interactions with NaAuClin aqueous media. Experiments with individual components did not result in gold nanoparticles production except linalool and catechin compounds. Both linalool and catechin compounds are therefore able to reduce NaAuClin aqueous media to produce purple red solution of AuNPs. The chemical constitution of linalool and catechin compounds used in generating the AuNPs comprises alcoholic OH functional group which might be responsible for the reduction of the NaAuCl. The stabilization property for AuNPs was provided only by catechin. The antioxidant catechin uniquely showed both reducing and stabilization properties simultaneously during the nanoparticle formation.

The production of gold nanoparticles did not happen in the presence of any carbohydrates present in cinnamon at room temperature 27 30 C. . Although the formation of AuNPs was observed with glucose arabinose galactose rhammose at elevated temperatures 80 C. the stability was not sufficient to hold the nanoparticles in solution for significant length of time. However when this reaction was carried out with initially dissolved starch or combination of individual carbohydrates a similar purple red color nanoparticle solution was obtained at room temperature with considerable stability to the AuNPs. These results unequivocally prove that while cinnamon phytochemicals are directly involved in NaAuClreduction the present carbohydrates in cinnamon provide synergistic benefits to the overall reduction as well as stabilization processes.

Biomedical imaging application requires the stability of Cin AuNP over a reasonable length of time. For this purpose the challenging tests were performed in presence of 10 NaCl cysteine histidine HSA and BSA solutions to determine the in vitro stabilities of the nano constructs in biological environments. The stability and the identity of Cin AuNPs were measured by recording UV absorbance after 30 min. The plasmon resonance band at 535 nm confirmed the retention of nanoparticulates in all the above mixtures. This indicates that the AuNPs are intact and thus demonstrate excellent in vitro stability in biological fluids at physiological pH. TEM measurements also inferred the retention of the nanoparticulate compositions in all of the above different medium signifying robust nature of these nanoparticles under in vitro conditions. The stability also remain unaffected from pH 4 to 9 range which implies that this Cin AuNPs can be used in a wide pH range for various biomedical applications.

In vivo stability was also tested. The cytotoxicity of Cin AuNPs was studied on primary human fibroblast cells under in vitro conditions by using a colorimetric cell viability MTT assay. In the MTT assay the cell viability was examined in terms of the absorbance of formazan produced by the cleavage of MTT by dehydrogenases in living cells at 570 nm which is directly proportional to the number of live cells. The experiment was performed using a wide range of concentrations of Cin AuNPs 0 25 50 125 and 165 M gold atoms . The relative cell viability was 90 for both 24 post treatment not significantly different from the control. It has been reported that a number of Auand Aucomplexes produces significant toxicity in cell culture media. In contrast cinnamon phytochemicals coated gold nanoparticles does not show any toxicity in primary human fibroblast cultures. This observation ensures that the phytochemicals present in cinnamon effectively reduce NaAuClin aqueous medium and provides the nontoxic surface coating for in vivo administrations in solutions.

Gold nanoparticles were also tested for their potential applications in drug delivery and intracellular imaging applications. The internalization of cinnamon phytochemicals coated gold nanoparticles in primary human fibroblast cells as well as in MCF 7 cancer cells was tested. After careful mixing of Cin AuNPs to both cells the gold nanoparticles incubated cells were washed vigorously using trypsin EDTA solution followed by PBS pH 7.4 to remove unbound gold nanorods. TEM images of Cin AuNPs after entering into the cells showed that cinnamon phytochemicals coated gold nanoparticles are preferentially taken by both cells cancerous as well as non cancerous and appeared as an individual probes in the endosomes. This endosomal localization within the cells also ensures that the specific uptake of the gold is due to the receptor mediated endocytosis. Some of the nanoparticles also appeared as a large cluster outside the cell surface. The unique behaviour of Cin AuNPs may provide new opportunities for understanding the cellular activities via nanoparticulate mediated imaging.

The in vivo biodistribution studies following intravenous injection of the nanoparticles 3.75 mg mL were carried out in two groups of mice each weighing 20 g. Following 200 L intravenous administrations of Cin AuNPs the mice were humanely sacrificed at 4 h and 24 h time periods. The collected blood and tissues brain heart kidney muscle pancreas tumor spleen lung liver tail and muscle were weighed and then frozen at 80 C. until sub sampling for analysis. Following partial thawing whole tissues were digested with a mixture of concentrate HNOand HCl acids 2 1 at 85 C. for overnight and the aliquots diluted in water were used for the analysis by AAS. The results of biodistribution studies for the intravenous route of administration of AuNPs as estimated by AAS showed minimum uptake of AuNPs in nontarget organs. Limited binding with blood plasma proteins also signifies the high in vivo stability presumably due to the effective coating of the phytochemicals around the AuNPs. The significant accumulation of Cin AuNPs in lung is almost identical from 4 h to 24 h. In addition there is also a gradual accumulation of gold nanoparticles in liver for up to 24 h. This accumulation in the liver may be due to the uptake of nanoparticles by the macrophages Kupffer cells present in the liver. However no toxic side effects were noted even at the 24 h post injection period. Indeed the excellent tolerance of high concentrations of injectable gold agents for example myochrysine as demonstrated in humans provides significant future prospects in the application of AuNPs to tumor imaging and therapy.

The portions of IV dose retained in liver at 4 h and 24 h sacrifice time are 9 and 14 while in lungs 17 and 16 respectively for mice treated with Cin AuNPs at doses of 200 l solution 3.75 mg mL . The amount of nanoparticulate gold found in the kidneys represented 

CT imaging was carried out using phantoms prepared from Cin AuNPs constructs as tissue mimics. Phantom images obtained at 80 and 140 kVp showed higher mean density of gold compared to the background results in a contrast differential HU HU Hounsfield units . HU values were measured for increasing amounts of Cin AuNPs and results showed a linear relationship observed between Cin AuNPs concentration and HU. Quantitative analysis of CT values for each concentration reveals that the cinnamon phytochemicals coated AuNPs has consistent attenuation coefficients with increasing concentrations. This result clearly suggests that Cin AuNPs may have a high potential for use in in vivo CT imaging.
