The present application was made with government support under Department of Energy Grant No. DE EE0002B95. The United States government may have certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure is directed in general to a cooling apparatus and method for an electronic component.

Electronic components have continued to increase in device density. The increase in device density typically gives rise to an increase in volumetric heat generation. This fact may reach a point where increased volumetric heat generation may create what can be called a thermal bottleneck that may seriously limit continued increases in the performance of the components or the equipment concerned.

Some embodiments of the disclosure relate to a device including a wick structure and a liquid supply source. The wick structure is configured to absorb liquid from the liquid supply source. As a consequence of receiving heat from a heat source the wick structure is configured to generate vapor from the absorbed liquid. The device further includes a vapor return channel configured to provide a path for conducting the generated vapor away from the wick structure.

Some embodiments of the disclosure relate to a method. According to the method a wick structure absorbs liquid from a liquid supply source. As a consequence of receiving heat from a heat source the wick structure generates vapor from the liquid absorbed. The vapor generated is then conducted away from the wick structure using a vapor return channel.

It is realized herein that in view of the above tendency to increased volumetric heat generation efficient heat transfer techniques capable of addressing the above heat generation problems are desirable.

A number of approaches have been proposed directed to improving heat transfer from the heat generating components such as the junction of transistors within the electronics of a device to a heat absorption environment such as the ambient.

However the current improvement in heat transfer capabilities does not appear to be at a pace sufficient to satisfy the growing demand for heat transfer as a result of the increased device density. This situation may in particular create a growing gap between the heat transfer capabilities of current chip level thermal management solutions and the chip level heat densities which are approaching about 1 kW cm 3. This thermal bottleneck may be better illustrated by the observation that in a typical high performance chip approximately 1 mg of material may be used for the transistors performing the computation 1 g of material may be used for the electrical interconnects and 1 kg of material may be used for the thermal management solution the numerical values are provided for illustration purposes only and may vary from device to device . New thermal management technologies are thus needed that are capable of addressing heat dissipation in a more efficient manner.

Attempts have been made toward providing solutions to the above problem. One such existing solution relates to making use of a combination of technologies to improve heat transfer from the junction of the devices within a chip to the ambient. This approach typically includes i using high thermal conductivity materials within the chip that enhance heat transfer from the electronic devices to the package of the chip as well as heat spreading elements to reduce the effect of hot spots a hot spot within the context of this disclosure refers to a physical location on the structure of the device where heat generation is substantially higher than the areas in the vicinity of that physical location ii using a low thermal resistance thermal interface material to thermally connect the chip to a heat spreader iii using an efficient heat spreader such as a vapor chamber to allow dissipation of the heat over a greater surface area iv attaching or integrating a high performance heat sinking solution for example a heat sink with an integrated fan to reject heat to the ambient environment.

The term chip within the context of the present disclosure may refer to any element including a miniaturized electronic optical or opto electronic circuit including but not limited to integrated circuits manufactured on semiconductor materials or compounds thereof crystals polymers metals or organic semiconductors.

Although the above known solution contributes to improving thermal dissipation in or from the chip the thermal bottleneck from the on chip devices to the package of chip is often not overcome.

In an attempt toward providing a viable solution to continue along the principles of Moore s law for example on a single core CPU addressing the thermal density problem at chip level as described above may therefore be increasingly desirable.

One additional frequent problem associated with the known solutions that use liquids to cool heat sources is the creation of bubbles which would typically impair the efficient performance of the device. Some embodiments disclosed herein attempt to provide cooling solutions which avoid or at least reduce the creation of bubbles. In this regards some embodiments of the disclosure are aimed at maintaining the heat transfer process within the so called evaporation regime. Evaporation regime in the context of the present disclosure relates to a regime of heat transfer in which a liquid is used for cooling a heat source such that as a consequence of receiving heat the liquid evaporates and thus produces a cooling effect without reaching a boiling point where bubbles are produced. Although maintaining the heat transfer process within evaporation regime is desirable it is not the only condition in which an apparatus as disclosed herein may be capable to provide satisfactory results. Indeed in some cases as will be pointed out further below there may exist a possibility of operating in the so called boiling regime as opposed to evaporation regime in which bubbles may be produced but the cooling process provided by the apparatus may still be satisfactory.

According to the embodiments disclosed herein thermal management at chip level may be addressed by incorporating structures within the chip that allow controlled evaporation of a fluid to occur near the high heat density components. Liquids typically have a large latent heat of vaporization which is a measure of the enthalpy difference between the gas phase and the liquid phase of the same substance . For example R134a has Hof about 215 J g at 1 atm butane has Hof about 385.6 J g and water has Hof about 2257 J g. This property gives liquids tremendous potential for heat removal. This principle is used for example in modern refrigeration systems.

Another benefit of using evaporation is that the phase change process can be controlled at a near isothermal temperature by controlling the operating pressure of the system. This has the advantage that by keeping the cooling liquid at a near isothermal temperature it may become possible to maximize the cooling capability of the cooling liquid for example given constraints on pumping capacity and pressure drop within the system. Considering the incoming temperature of the liquid as the reference temperature if one were to rely on single phase cooling using e.g. liquid water as is the case in some known devices the liquid water would need to heat up to absorb heat from the heat source. However for relatively low flow rates of water this temperature rise can be substantial which in turn increases the temperature of the cooling medium and consequently makes the heat source hotter. This problem may be addressed by having very high flow rates of liquid water to reduce the temperature rise of the liquid water. However this solution would typically require a large pump to drive the high flow rates of the liquid water which is also undesirable. In contrast by relying on vaporization of the liquid and maintaining the heat transfer within the evaporation regime as proposed herein the liquid temperature remains substantially at a constant level hence avoiding temperature rise of the cooling medium.

Referring to an exemplary schematic representation of a cross sectional view including a structure according to some embodiments is shown. The structure includes a wick structure . In the example of and the wick structure includes a plurality of capillary media .

The term capillary as used herein is known in the art. As a non limiting description of the same this term may be understood to relate to an effect according to which a liquid flows inside a narrow space i.e. a capillary medium when the liquid and the narrow space are placed in contact with each other without the need of using an external force to cause such flow of the liquid inside the narrow space. Such narrow space may be but is not limited to a narrow space or interstice provided between elongated fiber shaped bodies positioned contiguous to each other such as a bundle of bristles in a paint brush or a narrow space provided inside a body such as one provided inside a hollow cylinder. Herein the action caused by such effect may be referred to as capillary action and the narrow space may be referred to as a capillary medium be it inside a hollow body or between contiguous bodies as described in the above examples.

Referring back to the example of the capillary media of the wick structure are capable of performing a capillary action when such capillary media are placed in contact with a liquid in a liquid supply source or plenum . The liquid may be for example water.

The capillary media may be for example in the form of cylindrical or prismatic pores within a substrate having hollow interior spaces. For example elements represented by reference numeral in may be in the form of such cylindrical or prismatic pores within the wick structure represented by reference numeral . Alternatively the capillary media may be defined by means of narrow spaces provided between adjacent elongated bodies such as solid fiber type posts. In some embodiments capillary media may be defined by means of a hollow space provided between two adjacent bodies of heat conductors as will be described further below with reference to and

It is to be noted however that the above cylindrical and prismatic shapes for the pores are only provided as examples and other structures may also be used as appropriate. For example in sintered structures one may use conical pores or in porous silicon one may have randomly interconnected pores of differing size and shape in all three dimensions.

The structure further includes one or more channels for the return or ejection of vapor. Channels may be provided adjacent to the capillary media as shown in . Channels may be formed in any convenient manner. In the example of channels may be included by the space provided between adjacent heat conductors .

The structure of the exemplary embodiment of includes a plurality of heat conductor structures or heat conductors . The heat conductors are intended to provide a path for the heat transfer from the heat source to the wick structure when such heat conductors are brought into thermal contact with one or more heat sources .

Heat conductors may be made of any known material capable of providing heat transfer i.e. having negligible or low resistance to the conduction of heat . Examples of such materials may be metals such as aluminum copper nickel gold or silver or semiconductors such as silicon silicon carbide or carbon based materials such as graphite diamond and amorphous carbon. Preferably the heat conductors are solid structures to ensure improved heat transfer.

The heat conductors may have any suitable shape which may be designed according to the specific needs of each application. For example the heat conductors may be made in the form of pillars.

One or more heat sources may be brought into thermal contact with a heat spreader to spread the heat throughout a wider surface. The use of a heat spreader however is not mandatory. Heat spreader may be of any known type with thickness and a thermal conductance appropriate for the required use.

Referring now to the structure as described with reference to is shown assembled with other elements to perform heat dissipation. In like elements have been given like reference numerals as those of . As shown in the structure is assembled together with the liquid supply heat sources and the heat spreader . Heat sources may be any electronic components or chips to be cooled off as described further above.

In operation heat generated by the heat sources is optionally first transferred to the heat spreader . Heat conductors receive the heat from heat spreader and transfer the heat along or through the body of the heat conductors . In this example the heat conductors may be assumed to be solid pillars made of metal. As a result heat is transferred from heat spreader to the wick structure via the heat conductors .

The wick structure is in turn in contact with a liquid supply plenum . In the liquid supply plenum is located at a side opposite to the side where heat conductors make contact with the wick structure.

Liquid from the liquid supply plenum may be fed to the wick structure including the capillary media by two potential effects. One effect may be produced by using a pump which supplies the liquid to the liquid supply plenum and the capillary media . Another effect may be based on capillary forces where either one by itself or in combination produce a negative pressure differential that transports liquid from the plenum into the capillary media. The two mentioned effects may also be used in combination.

Once the liquid flows into a capillary medium the liquid reaches the vicinity of the heat conductors and evaporates due to the heat received from a heat conductor . This phase change i.e. liquid to vapor contributes to reducing the temperature cooling off the respective heat conductor .

It is to be noted that in transporting heat in the overall system various temperature drops within the system may be involved. As a non limiting example one may consider temperature drops through the heat conductors within the wick structure across the thin liquid layer in the wick structure between the liquid vapor interface and a condenser for example element in . Therefore the overall thermal resistance R between the device and the condenser may be expressed in units of C W as follows  device to condenser  heat spreader  conductors  wick  liquid film  interface  vapor to condenser.

The above parameters may therefore be taken into account upon designing a device to reduce as much as possible the overall temperature resistance in the device.

In this manner heat is transferred from the heat sources to the liquid which evaporates thereby cooling off the heat sources.

In the exemplary embodiment of the wick structure is located between the heat sources also the heat conductors and the liquid supply source . This configuration avoids a direct contact between of the liquid supply source with the heat sources and therefore eliminates or substantially reduces the creation of bubbles which otherwise may eventually result in a liquid dry out condition especially for high heat fluxes at the heat sources . In this configuration it may be considered that the apparatus may normally operate under evaporation regime.

Vapor generated as a result of the evaporation of the liquid typically at the liquid vapor interface within the wick structure may then leave the wick structure via vapor return or ejection paths provided by channels that are between the heat conductor pillars . One example of providing vapor return path is provided further below with reference to .

The direction of flow of the liquid and the vapor may be determined as convenient and according to the specific design requirements. In any case the liquid and the vapor may not necessarily flow in the same direction.

Referring now to an exemplary schematic representation of a cross sectional view including a structure according to some alternative embodiments is shown.

The structure includes one or more wick structures three shown . The wick structures each include a plurality of capillary media .

The capillary media of the wick structures are capable of performing a capillary action when such capillary media are placed in contact with a liquid .

The structure further includes a channel for vapor return. Channel may be provided adjacent to the capillary media as shown in . Alternatively channel may be separated from the capillary media and brought into contact therewith during operation.

Channel may be formed in any convenient manner. In the example of channel may include the entire space provided adjacent to the wick structures . In the example shown in one single channel is placed above the wick structure . However other positions and configurations of the channel adjacent the wick structures may likewise be envisaged. For example separate channels may be placed on each wick structure.

As shown in differently from the structure of wick structures are placed above heat sources and are fed by liquid from the supply plenums located preferably on one or various sides of the wick structures . In some embodiments the liquid from the supply plenums may be located under the wick structures . The wick structure may be made of capillary media having large capillary force. Some non limiting examples of such capillary media may be silicon nanograss carbon nanotubes metal nano micrograss porous silicon and sintered metal powder. The small sized features of the wick structures may allow large capillary forces to be generated which cause the liquid to flow into the wick structures and allow controlled evaporation.

The structure may then be used for cooling the heat sources as will be described with reference to . Heat sources may optionally be provided with a heat spreader .

Differently from the structure of the embodiment of and the structure of and also may be made without heat conductors. The absence of heat conductors may be advantageous in cases where size is of significance. The absence of heat conductors may also be advantageous as it may help to reduce thermal resistance in the device and temperature gradient between heat source and the liquid.

Referring now to the structure as described with reference to is shown assembled with other elements to perform heat dissipation. In like elements have been given like reference numerals as those of . As shown in the structure is assembled together with the liquid supply plenum heat sources and the heat spreader . Heat sources may be any electronic components or chips to be cooled off as described further above.

The vapor return channel is located above the wick structures to efficiently remove the vapor from wick structures . In this configuration the liquid supply plenum may supply liquid from the side of the wick structures as shown in or from the top of the wick structures not shown . Optionally an insulating material such as SiO2 may be placed in regions near the heat sources where it is desirable to avoid or at least substantially reduce transfer of heat from the heat sources directly to the liquid supply plenum . This may help avoid or reduce the creation of bubbles.

In operation heat generated by the heat sources is optionally first transferred to the heat spreader . Heat may then be transferred from the heat sources toward the wick structure . As mentioned above the use of an insulating material placed in regions near the heat sources may help avoiding the creation of bubbles in the liquid supply source. In this manner the liquid supply source may remain cooler where it is not needed to be heated up and as the liquid approaches the wick structure it may absorb increasing amounts of heat such that at the point where the liquid reaches the capillary media it may evaporate and thereby complete the cooling process.

As the wick structure is in contact with the liquid liquid from the liquid supply plenum flows into the porous wick structures including the capillary media in a similar fashion as that described in relation to . In the present example liquid may flow into the capillary media from the sides of the wick structures .

Once the liquid is flown inside a capillary medium it is at the same time in the vicinity of an area close to the position of the heat sources on the opposite side of the liquid supply plenum . Therefore due to an increased level of heat present in said area the liquid evaporates. This phase change i.e. liquid to vapor contributes to reducing the temperature cooling off of said area close to the position of the heat sources thereby contributing to cooling off the heat sources .

Vapor generated as a result of the evaporation of the liquid typically at the liquid vapor interface within the wick structure may then leave the wick structures via channel located above the heat wick structures . One example of providing vapor return path is provided further below with reference to .

In similar fashion to the direction of flow of the liquid and the vapor in the example of may be determined as convenient and according to the specific design requirements. Therefore in this example the liquid and the vapor may flow in or out of the plane of the figure or alternatively the liquid and the vapor may flow from left to right or from right to left as one looks at the figure. A combination of the above options may also be envisaged for the directions of flow of the liquid and the vapor. In any case the liquid and the vapor may not necessarily flow in the same direction.

It may be appreciated that in the exemplary embodiment of there is no specific insulating separation shown between the liquid supply source and the heat sources . In this configuration bubbles may be created even with the use of insulating layers of SiO2 as mentioned above proximate to the capillary media where temperature is higher however such bubbles would not significantly affect the performance of the device because the bubbles created are converted into vapor at the very vicinity of the capillary media and thus may easily leave the wick structure without causing vapor conduction blockage on the heat source . In this configuration therefore the apparatus may operate either in the evaporation regime avoiding the creation of bubbles or in the boiling regime in which bubbles are created as they are created away from the heat sources .

Referring now simultaneously to exemplary schematic representations respectively of a front view and a side view of a structure according to some alternative embodiments are shown.

The structure includes a wick structure generally shown by reference numeral . The wick structure includes a plurality of capillary media .

The capillary media of the wick structure are capable of performing a capillary action when such capillary media are placed in contact with a liquid .

The structure further includes channels not shown in . Channel may be formed in any convenient manner. In the example of channels may be included by the space provided between two adjacent heat conductors . The heat conductors preferably have the shape of a plane body such as a plate thus may also serve the purpose of forming walls for the channels .

In the exemplary embodiment of the the capillary media are provided within as in the case of porous silicon and or between the bodies of the heat conductors which form the walls of the channels .

In some embodiments the heat conductors may themselves have a porous structure for example by using porous silicon or the heat conductors may be made using sintered metal powder such as copper powder. In such cases the heat conductors and the wick structure form part of the same structure while having different functions namely the primary function of heat conductors is transferring heat away from the heat sources through conduction while the primary function of wick structure is absorbing heat from the heat conductors thereby efficiently transporting the heat to the liquid vapor interface.

Wick structure may be placed above heat sources and are fed by liquid from the liquid supply plenums .

As shown in the liquid supply plenums are formed by the spaces provided between two adjacent heat conductors . In operation the liquid supply plenums are configured to contain or convey liquid to be used for evaporation.

Therefore both channels and liquid supply plenums are formed between heat conductors which act as walls for such spaces. However whereas a channel is formed between a first heat conductor and a second heat conductor immediately next to the first heat conductor a liquid supply plenum is formed between said second heat conductor and a third heat conductor immediately next to the second heat conductor and these structure may be successively repeated as shown more clearly in showing three channels and two liquid supply plenums .

The width Wof the channels may be larger than the width Wof the liquid supply plenums . This allows the use of wider spaces for vapor ejection thereby improving performance.

The heat conductors may be provided on a support substrate . Optionally the support substrate may be a heat spreader.

The structure may then be used for cooling the heat sources . Heat sources may be any electronic components or chips to be cooled off as described further above.

Preferably a cover not shown may be used above the channels and the heat conductors e.g. on the top edges of the heat conductors as shown in to contain the flow of the liquid within the channels and avoid possible spill over of the liquid therefrom.

In operation when heat sources are brought into contact with the structure in heat sources are shown at a distance from the structure and may be brought into contact with each other heat generated by the heat sources may be transferred from the heat sources toward the heat conductors which also form the liquid supply plenums optionally with a heat spreader used between the heat sources and the liquid supply plenums .

Assuming that liquid is present or is made to flow in the liquid supply plenums liquid flows into the capillary media of wick structure in a similar fashion as that described in relation to . In the example shown in liquid is shown to be present inside the capillary media up to certain level L. This level L of the liquid in the capillary media may be higher than the level of the liquid present inside the liquid support plenums this level is not shown the difference in level being due to the capillary action within the capillary media . Although for the sake of simplicity of illustration the level of liquid in the liquid supply plenum is not shown in those skilled in the related art will realize that the liquid supply plenum contains at least some level of liquid present therein to allow proper operation of the device.

Once the liquid is flown inside a capillary medium the liquid is heated as a result of the heat present in the heat conductors which have absorbed and spread the heat from heat sources . Due to the increased level of heat received from the heat conductors the liquid inside the capillary medium evaporates. This phase change i.e. liquid to vapor contributes to reducing the temperature cooling off of the respective heat conductor thereby contributing to cooling off the heat sources .

Vapor generated as a result of the evaporation of the liquid typically at the liquid vapor interface within the wick structure may then leave the wick structure via channel . As shown the the vapor may be made to flow in the direction of arrows shown on the heat conductors namely toward the respective return channels next to each heat conductor . One example of providing vapor return path is provided further below with reference to .

The direction of flow of the liquid and the rejection of the vapor in the example of may be determined as convenient and according to the specific design requirements. Therefore in this example the liquid and the vapor to be rejected may flow in or out of the plane of which may be the same as flowing from left to right or from right to left as one looks at . A combination of the above options may also be envisaged for the directions of flow of the liquid and the vapor. In any case the liquid and the vapor may not necessarily flow in the same direction.

An insulating material such as SiO2 may be placed on the surface of the heat sources adjacent to the liquid supply plenums to reduce the potential for boiling to occur in the liquid. Alternatively an insulating material such as SiO2 may be placed on a surface below the liquid adjacent to the areas where the heat sources are placed.

Additionally it may be possible to use surface treatment to tailor the wetting properties of the surfaces. The coating would likely need to increase the wetting of the liquid. It may hence be chemical or also change the local roughness of the surface or a combination of the two. Wetting properties of surfaces may be modified by chemical treatment or causing physical changes through machining or microfabrication methods.

Furthermore this embodiment increases the surface area of the wick structures the plurality of capillary media as compared to the embodiments according to by orienting the capillary media along a width of the heat conductors thereby more surface contact is made possible provided that appropriate dimensioning of the heat conductors is observed.

In the exemplary embodiment of similar to that of there is no specific insulating separation shown between the liquid supply source and the heat sources . In this configuration also bubbles may be created proximate to the capillary media where temperature is higher however the apparatus may be designed in such a manner that such bubbles would not significantly affect the performance of the device. For example the heat conductors may be designed to cover locations which are in the vicinity of the heat sources . In this manner bubbles may be created mainly at locations nearby the capillary media and thus may easily leave the wick structure without causing vapor conduction blockage. In this configuration also the apparatus may operate either in the evaporation regime or in the boiling regime in which bubbles are created as they are created away from the heat sources .

In either cases of operation i.e. under boiling regime or evaporation regime the apparatus may be designed to operate using a thin film of liquid in the wick structure. Such thin film of liquid may be determined according to the specific design and the intended application of the apparatus. Some non limiting values for a thin film of liquid may be in a range at or below about 10 microns preferably about 1 micron or even more preferably in a range between 50 to 100 nm in depth thickness of the film .

Furthermore a low amount of superheating defined as the difference between the temperature of the heated liquid relative to its saturation temperature may be provided across the liquid to reduce boiling in the liquid. In the context of the present disclosure the term low may be determined by the skilled person depending on the type of liquid surface material roughness and operating pressure. An exemplary value for such a low temperature may be in range of about 5 degrees C. or lower.

Referring now simultaneously to respective exemplary representations of schematic front view top view and side view of a structure according to some embodiments will be described.

In this representation the principle of operation of the structure may be according to any one of the embodiments previously described with reference to and . In the embodiment of however an example of providing vapor return path will be described.

The structure includes one or more wick structures . The wick structure may include any convenient form with similar liquid absorption properties as discussed above with reference to the previous embodiments of the present disclosure.

The structure further includes one or more liquid supply sources an array of heat conductors and one or more channels for vapor return. The channel may be formed for example between the heat conductors .

The wick structure may be positioned above and may be brought in thermal contact with the array of heat conductors . The heat conductors in turn may be brought in thermal contact with a heat source . Here again a heat spreader may optionally be used to spread the heat from the heat source .

In operation the heat generated from the heat source is transferred with or without a heat spreader in between to the array of heat conductors . The heat conductors transfer the heat to the wick structure with which they are in or brought into thermal contact.

The wick structure is in turn in contact with the liquid supply plenum and therefore absorbs liquid from the liquid plenum in a similar fashion as that described in relation to and

As a consequence of the heat transferred from the heat conductors to the wick structure including absorbed liquid therein the liquid inside the wick structure evaporates and moves toward the channels as schematically shown in by arrows A. The vapor conducted away from the wick structure then moves or is conducted toward regions where the wick structure is not present so that the vapor may continue to flow toward the output . This action is schematically shown in by arrows B.

Once the vapor clears into the open regions as shown by arrows B it may flow toward the output as shown by arrows C in . In doing so the vapor may pass through holes provided within the body of a cover plate located above the entire structure. The use of the cover plate however is optional.

In some embodiments in which a cover plate is used the cover plate may act as one of the surfaces enclosing the inlet plenum this configuration may be advantageous from a microfabrication perspective.

Once the vapor reaches the space in the vicinity of the output it may be directed out of the apparatus as schematically shown by arrows D.

The driving force for vapor return out of the device may be provided either by using known means or by using the solution described below with continued reference to .

To drive the vapor out of the device use may be made of a condenser region such as a water cooled cold plate where the vapor condenses at a lower saturation temperature. For simplicity of illustration the condenser is only shown in as additional illustration in are considered not necessary for the understanding of the present disclosure.

The liquid so condensed may then be fed into a pump which may redirect the condensed liquid into the liquid supply source by appropriate pump action.

The lower pressure associated with the lower saturation temperature may create a pressure differential between the liquid vapor interface and condenser region sufficient to drive the vapor flow. Another possibility is the design of the vapor return path e.g. the structure of the channels plenums manifolds etc. so as to efficiently return the vapor from the liquid vapor interface within the wick structure to the condenser region without undue pressure drop or flow resistance. By avoiding undue pressure drop or flow resistance the appropriate operation of the device may be ensured. Indeed excessive flow resistance or pressure drop may impede or degrade the flow of the vapor out of the device which is undesirable.

To address the problems associated to excessive flow resistance or pressure drop it is desirable that the vapor enters a flow path with as large a throughput space as possible thereby minimizing the pressure drop. In the example of such throughput space may include the space confined between the conducting walls below the wick structure and any additional space available within the structure contributing to enabling the flow of the vapor which may include progressively larger area structures for the vapor to flow through.

In some embodiments a first vapor return channel may merge and be joined into a second vapor channel of larger cross sectional area. This may contribute to a better flow of the vapor away from the wick structure thereby providing a more efficient heat transfer.

Although in various embodiments disclosed herein one common liquid supply is shown to be used for providing liquid to the wick structures it is to be noted that such configuration is only exemplary and the device may likewise include multiple distinct liquid supply sources configured to provide liquid to the wick structures.

Furthermore as shown in various embodiments disclosed herein at least some liquid supply channels and some vapor return channels may be disposed alternately from each other. That is to say a liquid supply channel may be located between two adjacent vapor return channels and a return channel may be located between two adjacent liquid supply channels.

In the various embodiments disclosed herein it may be preferable to design the size diameter length width or height of the capillary medium so as to optimize performance for example to guarantee an adequate liquid flow rate to avoid dry out to reduce the thickness of the thin liquid layer or to avoid overflow of the liquid through the capillary medium in case an additional driving force is used for supplying the liquid.

Referring now to a method is described. At an initial stage a wick structure absorbs a liquid from a liquid supply source.

At a next stage the wick structure is heated. At a next stage the wick structure generates vapor in response to heat received.

An array of heat conductors may provide a thermal path for transfer of heat from the heat source to the wick structure.

An insulating material may be provided in a region near the liquid supply source to avoid or at least substantially reduce direct transfer of heat from a heat source to the liquid supply source.

The vapor generated transported away from the wick structure may be condensed in a condenser for reuse of the condensed liquid.

The liquid to be used for the cooling process as disclosed herein may be for example water. Another example of a liquid to be used is a dielectric liquid which in contrast to water may be harmless to electronics in case of a leak.

One advantage of the disclosed solution is that by using evaporation it allows extremely large heat transfer rates that are typically not possible using existing conduction based approaches.

Another advantage of the proposed solution is that at least in some embodiments it allows for controlling the heat transfer to be maintained in an evaporation regime thereby minimizing or avoiding the creation of bubbles at the liquid vapor interface within the wick structure. Furthermore even if in some configurations bubbles may be created such bubbles may not significantly degrade the performance of the apparatus. Therefore by using the solution as proposed herein more stable operation is expected in contrast to for example flow boiling in channels where dryout can typically occur.

The solution proposed herein is also advantageous as compared to known solutions using single phase liquid cooled systems. Such systems often have additional thermal resistance due to the sensible heat rise of the liquid and the lower heat transfer coefficient associated with single phase heat transfer.

Furthermore the controlled evaporative technique as disclosed herein also has benefits over for example flow boiling in microchannels used in known solutions. Due to the significantly narrow diameter of microchannels it may become possible that a vapor layer is trapped adjacent to the microchannel. This may deleteriously affect heat transfer and even lead to device failure.

It is to be noted that the list of structures corresponding to the claimed elements is not exhaustive and that one skilled in the art understands that equivalent structures can be substituted for the recited structure without departing from the scope of the invention.

It is also to be noted that the order of the actions as recited in the corresponding method claims is not limited to the order as presented and described and may vary without departing from the scope of the invention.
