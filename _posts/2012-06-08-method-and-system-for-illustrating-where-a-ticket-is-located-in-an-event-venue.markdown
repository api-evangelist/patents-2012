The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 983 014 filed Dec. 31 2010 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 552 782 filed on Oct. 25 2006. Each of the above applications are incorporated by reference herein their entirety.

A system and method is provided for illustrating where at least one ticket is located in an event venue comprising accepting event criteria for at least one ticket and at least one event accepting price criteria for the at least one ticket and the at least one event displaying an interactive graphics based event venue map illustrating a location of all sections at a venue with at least one ticket meeting the event criteria and price criteria accepting section selection criteria at least one section being selected from the interactive graphics based event venue map displaying ticket information in a web browsing language corresponding to the section selection criteria the displayed ticket information in the web browsing language being able to be utilized to drill down to a specific ticket causing a location of the specific ticket to be displayed in the interactive graphics based event venue map and enabling a capability to utilize the interactive graphics based event venue map to choose a section of interest causing corresponding ticket information to be displayed in the web browsing language. The interactive graphics based event venue map can be in FLASH or any other application. The web browsing language can be HTML or any other language.

According to several embodiments of the invention any kind of event at any kind of venue can be utilized. Furthermore ticket information can include listing information e.g. tickets available for sale transaction information e.g. prices at which tickets have been sold and or bid information e.g. prices at which buyers are willing to pay for tickets . The listing information can include ticket information on at least one ticket sold at a fixed price ticket information on at least one ticket sold at a declining price or ticket information on at least one ticket available for auction or any combination thereof. In addition the system and method are able to interact with third party sites and can be utilized with any web enabled software application whether or not hosted by the same party hosting the method. Furthermore although the event venue map is interactive other event venue maps may be illustrated in the system and method that are not interactive such as but not limited to where an exact location corresponding to an exact ticket is shown on a map just prior to purchase.

As a user manipulates the elements in each of these modules by clicking a link or selecting a value from a menu interaction events are generated causing a message to be dispatched to mediator which is the application that executes in the client web browser. Mediator is responsible for interpreting each interaction event and making the appropriate communication with the other modules.

The filter module presents the user with a form containing a variety of input elements. These elements allow the user to filter the ticket listing module and map according to event price and quantity. In one embodiment an end user can use event dropdowns price bucket checkboxes and quantity dropdowns to build a set of filter criteria. This criteria set is used to explicitly request filtered tickets via a find or search button present in the filter module . In one embodiment the filter module will reset any work done on the interactive map module . This find or search button dispatches a message to the mediator described in more detail below.

The interactive map may provide several interactive elements to the user. It can provide a transparent box with section summary information presented when a user hovers their mouse over a section. It can also provide also a visual representation map of the event venue broken up into sections. Additionally it can provide a color coded aggregation of sections into zones such as bleacher or loge . These zones are displayed as a list of small colored boxes outside the map itself. The colors of each zone box correspond to the colors of each section within that zone. When a section has inventory the section is colored in on the map with the color of its parent zone.

There are several actions that a user can take via the interactive map. For example a mouse can be clicked on an individual section or on one of the aggregate zone boxes. In each case a message is dispatched to the mediator . For clicks on an individual section this message contains the id of the section clicked. For clicks on a zone the message contains the IDs of all the sections that have this zone as their parent. 

The ticket listing module presents an interactive element to the user a sort link which can be present at the top of each column. Clicking one of these links will dispatch a message to the mediator described below.

As described above interaction events are dispatched to the mediator a custom javascript application that executes in the user s web browser. The mediator is responsible for interpreting these messages constructing a ticket service request interpreting a ticket service response and updating the interactive modules accordingly.

The mediator exposes a simple Application Programming Interface API that each module can call when an appropriate interaction event is used. The mediator accepts data via this API and uses it to maintain a persistent internal representation of what a user is requesting. Maintaining this state allows the ability for a user to leave a page and return without losing all of their filtering work. The latest requested set of filter actions is saved and used to reconstruct the previous session if a user returns to the page. In addition the requests the mediator makes to the ticket service can be split into at least two distinct types filtering tickets by criteria and retrieving tickets by section IDs. These two request types can exist in a hierarchy or can be performed independently.

A filter tickets by criteria request can operate against the universe of tickets in the venue clearing any previously supplied section ID criteria. A retrieve tickets by section ID request on the other hand can operate only against the filtered ticket set assuming filter criteria is present.

After receiving a message from one of the primary modules the mediator will assemble an appropriate request string and initiate an HTML request to the ticket service . The ticket service will interpret this request to determine the nature of ticket retrieval and filtering requested execute the request and return an Extensible Markup Language XML data set representing the tickets that match the criteria supplied by the mediator .

Upon receiving the returned ticket data the mediator can parse the returned data to extract summary data about the response set which it uses to update some display areas. These areas include but are not limited to the total tickets information provided at the top of the listing as well as the pagination links. It also extracts a list of all section IDs that the current ticket response data matches. The mediator can pass this list to the interactive map module which updates itself to only color the sections that are relevant for the returned result set. Along with updating the interactive map the mediator also parses the full listing of tickets and dynamically redraws the ticket listing accordingly. At this point the application is ready to receive new interaction events and the cycle repeats.

If in step or step it is determined that yes the event venue map is already at minimum zoom then the process moves to . In the ballpark.dragger visible 0. This means that the dragger is made invisible. In one embodiment the dragger says Click Here To Drag and appears when the event venue map is zoomed in and is used during a prolonged click by the user to move the map around in order to get a better view of the sections. The dragger features are illustrated in . The dragger is no longer needed when the map is zoomed out to its minimum. In the ballpark is set to original X. In the ballpark is set to original Y. In the ballpark is set to original width. In the ballpark is set to original height. Thus if in or it is determined that the event venue map is a its minimum zoom then steps and return the event venue map to the zoom setting it was at in which is the minimum zoom.

In the on dragger rollout feature is chosen. In the hand icon visible is set to off and the hand icon is not visible. In the process is finished.

In the on dragger press feature is chosen. In the hand closes. In the event venue map is dragged or moved to see different areas of the ballpark. In the process is finished.

In the on dragger release feature is chosen. In one embodiment when the event venue map is zoomed in a box appears which reads Click Here To Drag . When the user s mouse moves over this box the cursor is replaced with a hand. When the user clicks and holds the click while within the box the hand closes as if to grab the map. While the mouse is pressed the hand remains closed and the ballpark becomes moveable by the user. When the user releases the mouse the hand opens the ballpark is at the location the user moved it to and the ballpark is no longer moveable. Thus referring to in the hand opens and in the ballpark is not draggable. In and x hand x and y hand y which means that the event venue stays at the same x and y coordinates the user left them when dragging the hand icon. In the process is finished.

In the section rollout feature is chosen. As discussed above in or an icon appears over the even venue map as a result of a section rollover. When that section is no longer rolled over the user rolls out and whatever appears in or is made invisible.

If the answer to is yes and the zone check is on in all section IDs in the zone are sent to the HTML ticket listing module . In all sections in the zone are unpinned. In the section s zone is unchecked. In the process finished.
