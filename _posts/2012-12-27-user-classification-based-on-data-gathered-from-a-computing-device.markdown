title: User classification based on data gathered from a computing device
abstract: Data regarding user actions on a user device is gathered from the user device (and/or from another computing device) by a server. The data is analyzed to make a decision. The decision is sent by the server to the user device (e.g., directly or via another computing device) and then used by the user device to implement a new action on the user device. This process may be automatically repeated in order to provide real-time customization of the user device.

At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to user classification in general and more particularly but not limited to classification of a user based on data gathered from a computing device e.g. a computing device of the user or a server in communication with a user s computing device .

One common type of computing device is a mobile device such as an iPhone device. Mobile devices have evolved beyond simple telephone functionality and are now more complex multi functional devices. In addition to voice communications many mobile devices are capable of text messaging email communications Internet access and the ability to run full featured application software. For example mobile devices can use these capabilities to perform online transactions. Furthermore mobile devices used by an individual or a business often store information in many forms such as electronic documents text messages etc. Users may be presented with advertisements or other product information when using the mobile device.

Applications that run on the mobile device may for example be downloaded and installed from an application marketplace. An example of an application marketplace is the Google Play service. Some of these applications may present varying advertisements to the user during execution.

Also advertisements may be presented to a user of a computing device when accessing a website to shop for goods or services e.g. when using a web browser on the computing device . For example a user accessing the Amazon.com website may be presented with a number of recommended products for potential purchase i.e. products selected by the website for interest by a particular customer .

Systems and methods for classification of a user based on data gathered from a computing device of the user are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.

In one embodiment data regarding one or more user actions on a user device e.g. data regarding actions taken by the user during actual usage of the device such as user settings selected by the user and or interactions by the user with a user interface of an application installed on the device is gathered from the user device by a server. The data is analyzed to make a decision. The decision is sent by the server to the user device and then used by the user device to implement a new action on the user device e.g. the action may be the changing of a setting on the device the sending of an email from the device or the changing of a page presented on a user display of the device .

In some cases the decision is simply the selection of the new action by the server which is then communicated to the user computing device for implementation of the new action e.g. the changing of a user interface screen on the user computing device in order to present additional advanced user options and or the changing of the functionality or logic of an application on the user device in order to customize the application for an advanced user .

In one example the new action may be implemented automatically by the user device after receipt of the decision. In a different example a score is sent to the user device with the decision. Implementation of the new action is based on the score and the decision to implement is made at the user device.

In another example the gathered data is used to classify the user into one of several different user categories stored at the server. A new action from the selected category is sent to the user device for implementation. The new action may be automatically implemented by the user device or the decision whether to implement the new action may be made at the user device.

In one embodiment decision making is based on data gathered at a computing device and sent to the server as part of a single communication or session with the server i.e. it is only the data gathered in this one activity that is used to make the decision . In another embodiment previously gathered data is retained on the server and there are one or several additional cycles of newly gathering of data. The prior and new gathered data are analyzed to make a decision. For example in some cases an isolated occurrence itself on the mobile device may be an insufficient basis for changing a user category. Instead a repeated pattern of behavior e.g. detected using newly gathered data and also previously gathered data is used to make the decision.

In another embodiment a method includes receiving data gathered by an application on a computing device of a user wherein the gathered data comprises a plurality of user actions performed by the user on the computing device analyzing by at least one processor the gathered data to provide an output decision and a score and sending the output decision and the score to the computing device wherein a local decision will be made by the computing device based on the score e.g. whether the score is greater than a predetermined threshold value whether to implement a first action on the computing device and wherein the first action corresponds to the output decision. In one example a set of threshold values may be stored locally on the user device. In an alternative embodiment these values are stored at the server and the decision to implement an action is made at the server based on these values.

In one embodiment a system includes a data repository storing a plurality of user categories including a first user category and further storing a first action associated with the first user category at least one processor and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processor to receive data gathered by an application on a computing device of a user wherein the gathered data comprises at least one user action performed by the user analyze the gathered data to classify the user into the first user category and in response to classifying the user into the first user category send the first action for implementation on the computing device.

In one embodiment a decision is made but the first action is not sent immediately for implementation on the computing device. Instead the decision is queued or scheduled for transmission at a later time. This may include instances in which the action involved is something that would desirably be performed at a different time or in a different situation from the present situation e.g. during the night when the user is not using the device actively or when there is higher bandwidth available or more power available or other circumstances . In some cases the category itself is sent to the device rather than the action and the device will take action based on the received category.

In another embodiment a computer readable storage medium stores computer readable instructions which when executed cause a computing device of a user to gather data on the computing device wherein the gathered data comprises at least one user action performed by the user send the gathered data to a server configured to classify based on analysis of the gathered data the user into a first user category of a plurality of user categories stored at the server in a data repository wherein the data repository includes at least one action corresponding to the first user category receive from the server the at least one action and implement the at least one action on the computing device. The data may be gathered by an application or other type of software that is executing on the user computing device e.g. the application may have been previously downloaded from an application marketplace .

In one case an operating system provider can build the above data gathering capability into the operating system itself as an integral component. In another case the user computing device may contain a virtualization solution e.g. a virtual machine in which runs the operating system in which run the applications . In this case the data gathering component may be implemented within the virtualization solution or machine as a component.

In one embodiment some of the above classification activities are performed on the user computing device itself. For example some simple user classification decisions may be easily and or economically available within an application on the user computing device and not require recourse to a server . Also in some cases a subset of a data repository can be available on a user computing device itself e.g. in addition to being available on the server . In some cases all analysis and processing is done on the user computing device. In other cases different types of information can be sent to the server so as to obtain optionality when it is time to implement a decision on the device. Various examples are as follows gather data on device send data to server to be analyzed receive action on device gather data on device analyze data on device send category to server receive action on device etc.

In yet other embodiments the decision can be sent to a server or other computing device instead of the user computing device. The action taken is taken by the server e.g. based on the decision and score that it may receive . For example the server sends an email at an appropriate or correct time based on user actions e.g. data is gathered from the user actions and used to make a decision that leads to sending the email .

The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform the above methods and systems including data processing systems which perform these methods and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.

Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.

The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However in certain instances well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one.

Reference in this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.

In user terminals e.g. . . . and or mobile devices are used to access and or communicate with one or more of classification server application marketplace e.g. an Android or Google Play marketplace and or messaging server e.g. an email server over a communication network e.g. the Internet a wide area network or other wired or wireless communications network . As mentioned above each of the user terminals . . . and mobile devices may communicate with classification server to send gathered data regarding user actions for each respective device to classification server .

A data repository stored on or accessible by classification server stores a plurality of user categories e.g. including basic intermediate and advanced user categories . Data repository further stores one or more actions associated with each of the user categories .

Each action is a function or event that will be performed or caused to occur on the user s computing device. Data gathered from a computing device such as mobile device is sent to classification server and analyzed to select a user category for example corresponding to the real time or substantially real time operation of the mobile device by the user. It should be noted that in other cases real time operation is not necessary. Also in some cases the accumulated information that is analyzed is gathered over time e.g. gathered at several different times . The accumulated data is used to update a user category based on real time data as well as historical data.

As an example an action may be sent to the mobile device less than 5 seconds after receiving data gathered from the mobile device that was analyzed in order to determine the action. In various examples the time period may be even shorter such as 1 second 100 milliseconds or even 10 milliseconds.

Classification server stores various models that may be used to analyze data gathered from mobile device . Applications e.g. Application A or Application B have been previously installed on mobile device . An application e.g. Application A gathers data regarding user actions from mobile device . The application or mobile device sends the data to classification server . Classification server analyzes the gathered data to classify the user into one of the user categories e.g. these categories may include a basic user category and an advanced user category . One or more models are used during this analysis. In one embodiment models includes user classification models that are used in the analysis. After the user is classified into a particular user category e.g. an advanced user category at least one action corresponding to the selected user category is sent for implementation on mobile device .

In one embodiment the data is gathered from a plurality of applications i.e. not merely from a single application and is used to make the decision. In some cases the data gathered from one application is used to make a decision regarding a different application.

In one embodiment user classification user categories may be either dependent on or independent from specific applications. For example a user may have a single classification of expertUser or the user could be a noviceUser for application A and an expertUser for application B. The user classification may be application specific or may apply to two or more applications associated with the user.

In one embodiment user classifications categories can be used across devices. For example the user may have a tablet and a smartphone. The user is classified as an expertUser on the smartphone. That user classification may be used for the user s tablet and the user be designated as an expertUser on the tablet. The decision making process for the tablet may at least include the user s classifications categories on other devices of the user.

In one embodiment data gathered from a device can be joined with data gathered from other sources for use in decision making or user classification. For example such data from other sources may include network traffic information for the user gathered at a network gateway information about the user from a security event correlation system data from a social network data from a bank and or data from a personal computer or other devices of the user.

Network may be used to download and remotely install applications selected from marketplace e.g. using Google Play or the Android Market . Marketplace may include one or more web servers or other types of data communication servers to communicate with the user terminals e.g. . . . and mobile devices . The applications available for installation from marketplace may each be configured to send data to classification server and optionally to communicate the same or other data to software server . Further each such available application may be configured to use messaging server for messages to or from the user of a computing device. It should be noted that applications need not be obtained from marketplace . In other cases applications or other software may be obtained from any source. Examples include applications that are pre loaded on a device applications that are pushed to the device by a device management solution and applications that are installed loaded via other means.

In one example an owner of an Android phone e.g. mobile device may visit a web site hosted by marketplace and select a free poker game application for remote installation on mobile device . The user may authenticate itself to marketplace by its email address e.g. Gmail address and password. The poker game application may send data to classification server which may use this gathered data to adjust or customize the operation of the poker game application in response to actions received from classification server . These actions may change the difficulty level of play change the number of options presented for selection by the user and or change the user interface displays. Also betting limits may be adjusted in real time for the user based on a user category selected by classification server using a model . The software code necessary to provide the changed user device operation may be previously stored on the user device or may be sent from classification server or from a server pointed to by a link from server for example with or after sending the action.

The marketplace and or messaging server are connected to respective data storage facilities to store applications messaging account data for users user preference data and other data. In messaging server is connected to communication network to deliver messages e.g. email or text to user terminals or one of a user s mobile devices .

In one embodiment a software server is coupled to communicate with application marketplace and or mobile devices by communication network . Server stores for example an application in memory and sends the application to application marketplace for later download and installation by a user onto for example mobile device . In another embodiment software server is a developer computer or another computer used to upload an application to marketplace .

In one embodiment server communicates with the application now executing on mobile device after installation by the user . The application is configured to gather data from mobile device and send data to classification server and optionally to communicate with software server . In one embodiment mobile device includes applications that have been previously installed on mobile device . Applications may be installed from application marketplace or software server .

Although illustrates an exemplary system implemented in client server architecture embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various alternative architectures. For example the classification server or application marketplace may be implemented via a peer to peer network of user terminals in some embodiments where applications and data information from mobile devices are shared via peer to peer communication connections.

In some embodiments a combination of client server architecture and peer to peer architecture can be used in which one or more centralized server may be used to provide some of the information and or services and the peer to peer network is used to provide other information and or services. Thus embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to a particular architecture.

In one embodiment as regards the breadth and persistence of user categories if a particular user has already been categorized as an advanced user for other applications a new application may be automatically delivered to the user s mobile device. The new application is set up or configured assuming that the user is an advanced user.

In one embodiment application marketplace gathers data e.g. a download of history and analyzes it locally or on a server to produce user characteristics e.g. a category for the user . Applications downloaded via marketplace access the user characteristics e.g. an environment variable provided by an API in the marketplace application .

In one embodiment an advertising component on the device or the device and a server gathers data and characterizes the user. Device applications request user characteristics from the advertising component. The user can manually disable or update characteristics in the advertising component e.g. via a mobile application or a web site .

User interface screen includes an output display window user input field and user input field . Output display window may present a certain type of data associated with operation of an application . Input fields and may receive selections by the user using a touch screen interface or mouse as examples in order to input data or make a user selection.

As described herein a user interface may be initially kept simple for basic users but by being able to detect that users are or have become through experience more advanced decisions are made based on their actions to classify them as advanced users. In an alternative embodiment an initially classified advanced user may be later classified as a basic user. More specifically based on a prior time period e.g. the last six months of activity it may be observed that a user is behaving like a basic user. In such a case the user can be reclassified back to a basic user and the user interface may be modified appropriately. Also applications may be delivered assuming users are advanced. Then by gathering data and making decisions the users may be reclassified into basic users. In one example the time period is used to help make a decision e.g. no advanced user related actions occurred in the last six months so a reclassification decision is being made based on the age of the previously gathered data and the absence of any additional new recent gathered data.

Additional information regarding various non limiting examples of mobile devices and their usage more generally including the presenting of information regarding a mobile device to a user is described in previously published U.S. Patent Application No. 2011 0047033 A1 published Feb. 24 2011 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOBILE DEVICE REPLACEMENT by Mahaffey et al. the entire contents of which application is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

In one embodiment there are various ways to identify characteristics that are actually present in an application. For example U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011 0047597 published on Feb. 24 2011 and titled System and Method for Security Data Collection and Analysis by Mahaffey et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein provides a general discussion about the gathering of information from an application on a mobile device for further processing at a server. According to this embodiment information that has been gathered as described by Mahaffey et al. in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011 0047597 may be used for classification analysis at classification server in order to select a user category as described above. In another embodiment behavioral data may be determined or collected using other approaches. For example data may be gathered based on network traffic e.g. SMS IP data associated with the user computing device.

In the system includes an inter connect e.g. bus and system core logic which interconnects a microprocessor s and memory . The microprocessor is coupled to cache memory in the example of .

The inter connect interconnects the microprocessor s and the memory together and also interconnects them to a display controller and display device and to peripheral devices such as input output I O devices through an input output controller s . Typical I O devices include mice keyboards modems network interfaces printers scanners video cameras and other devices which are well known in the art.

The inter connect may include one or more buses connected to one another through various bridges controllers and or adapters. In one embodiment the I O controller includes a USB Universal Serial Bus adapter for controlling USB peripherals and or an IEEE 1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE 1394 peripherals.

The memory may include ROM Read Only Memory and volatile RAM Random Access Memory and non volatile memory such as hard drive flash memory etc.

Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM DRAM which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. Non volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive e.g. a DVD RAM or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non volatile memory may also be a random access memory.

The non volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non volatile memory that is remote from the system such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface can also be used.

In one embodiment a data processing system as illustrated in is used to implement classification server application marketplace messaging server and or other servers. In another embodiment a data processing system as illustrated in is used to implement a user terminal a mobile device or another computing device on which an application is installed. A user terminal may be in the form for example of a notebook computer or a personal desktop computer.

In some embodiments one or more servers of the system can be replaced with the service of a peer to peer network of a plurality of data processing systems or a network of distributed computing systems. The peer to peer network or a distributed computing system can be collectively viewed as a server data processing system.

Embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented via the microprocessor s and or the memory . For example the functionalities described can be partially implemented via hardware logic in the microprocessor s and partially using the instructions stored in the memory . Some embodiments are implemented using the microprocessor s without additional instructions stored in the memory . Some embodiments are implemented using the instructions stored in the memory for execution by one or more general purpose microprocessor s . Thus the disclosure is not limited to a specific configuration of hardware and or software.

In the position identification unit is used to identify a geographic location. The position identification unit may include a satellite positioning system receiver such as a Global Positioning System GPS receiver to automatically identify the current position of the user device. This data may be part of the data gathered by the classification server .

In some embodiments the user classification categorization can be contextual. For example in certain locations or during certain contextual activities a user can be considered a basic user while in other contexts a user is treated as an advanced user. The use of context in making decisions and switching between different user categories contextually may be advantageous in some implementations. The data gathered for making user classification decisions can include data regarding the user s context such as for example location battery life Wi Fi related data and characteristics etc.

In one embodiment categorization can be extended to use conditional categorization. More specifically if a given event or item happens then a user is given a first classification if a different given event or item happens then the user is given a second classification. The device may receive the conditional categorizations from the classification server. In some cases the server may send a classification or other model to a computing device that takes or receives input e.g. input from actions or other data on the device and produces a categorization. The model may be created or selected based on analysis of gathered data on the server.

In the communication device is configured to communicate with a network server to provide data including location data. In one embodiment the user input device is configured to receive or generate user data or content. The user input device may include a text input device a still image camera a video camera and or a sound recorder etc.

Various further embodiments are now described below. In one embodiment a method includes receiving data gathered by software e.g. application or another application on a computing device e.g. mobile device of a user wherein the gathered data comprises a plurality of user actions e.g. touching on a certain application selection option performed by the user on the computing device analyzing by at least one processor e.g. on classification server the gathered data to provide an output decision and a score and sending the output decision and the score to the computing device wherein a local decision will be made by the computing device based on the score whether to implement a first action on the computing device and wherein the first action corresponds to the output decision.

The output decision may be a determination that the user is in a first user category e.g. an advanced user category of a plurality of user categories e.g. categories and the first action is a function to be implemented by the application for users in the first user category. The function may be stored on the computing device prior to the gathering of the data by the application. The sending may include sending the function to the computing device. The sending the output decision and the score may be performed less than 5 seconds after the receiving data gathered by the application.

In one embodiment the output decision is a first output decision and the method further comprises receiving additional data gathered by the application on the computing device wherein the additional data comprises at least one user action performed by the user on the computing device analyzing the gathered data to provide a second output decision and sending the second output decision to the computing device for implementing a second action on the computing device.

In one embodiment a system includes a data repository e.g. data repository storing a plurality of user categories including a first user category and further storing a first action associated with the first user category at least one processor and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processor to receive data gathered by an application on a computing device of a user wherein the gathered data comprises at least one user action performed by the user analyze the gathered data to classify the user into the first user category and in response to classifying the user into the first user category send the first action for implementation on the computing device.

The instructions may be further configured to instruct the at least one processor to determine a score associated with the first user category. The score may be a probability value or a confidence value. The sending of the first action may be conditional on the score being greater than a threshold value. The implementation of the first action on the computing device may be conditional on the score being greater than a threshold value. The analyzing of the gathered data may include using a user classification model e.g. one or more of models to classify the user into the first user category.

The instructions may be further configured to instruct the at least one processor to receive a selection from the user to adjust the user classification model the selection provided by the user on a user interface of the computing device and adjust the user classification model based on the selection.

In one embodiment a non transitory computer readable storage medium stores computer readable instructions which when executed cause a computing device of a user to gather via at least one processor data on the computing device wherein the gathered data comprises at least one user action performed by the user send the gathered data to a server configured to classify based on analysis of the gathered data the user into a first user category of a plurality of user categories stored at the server in a data repository wherein the data repository includes at least one action corresponding to the first user category receive from the server the at least one action and implement via the at least one processor the at least one action on the computing device.

The instructions may further cause the computing device to present on a display of the computing device a user interface to the user the user interface comprising a first user interface element. The implementing of the at least one action may include updating the user interface. The updating of the user interface may include adding a second user interface element.

In one embodiment the first user interface element is a first user input field and the second user interface element is a second user input field. The gathering data on the computing device may include gathering data associated with a user action performed by the user via the user interface. The data may be gathered by an application e.g. application running on the computing device and the gathering data may begin after a predetermined time period from installation of the application on the computing device.

Additional exemplary non limiting details regarding various implementations of the above embodiments are now described here below. In one example classification server takes in a large corpus of data on a real time basis e.g. by the millisecond . A model processes this data and then synthesizes it into product actions e.g. to be implemented on mobile device .

The gathered data may include data on user behavior. For example such data may include user settings the user action of uploading a picture or the manner in which a user interacts with a user interface. A product experience e.g. for a user interacting with an application is customized based on that user interaction. The gathered data may include the features that a user uses on application and also how long the user uses a given feature. For example the data may include time spent by a user in a web layer e.g. if the user visits and logs onto a website . In another example the data may include whether the user visits a website to locate the user s lost phone. Other data may include options and preferences the user has set for herself on the user s device e.g. a setting to back up contacts weekly and the locating of the user s phone daily .

There can be multiple segments or categories of users that interact with or use an application e.g. an inexperienced user category and a technically proficient user category . Both types of users are using the same installed application. Based on the data gathered or collected classification server can determine whether the user is a technical or a non technical user without the user having to explicitly provide that information to server or to the user s computing device .

A technical user is more likely to go into the settings screen and set different options. So when an email is sent to a technical user describing how the user can use the product e.g. one of applications the content of the email is more technical in nature as opposed to simpler content in an email for a non technical user. This analysis and selecting of an action to implement i.e. the sending of this email is done in real time i.e. the user experiences real time changes and or events .

There can be a large number of user categories e.g. tens or hundreds of categories . For example there might be 12 user categories. Gathered data may also include data that does not change frequently such as user characteristics e.g. what phone a user has the carrier used etc. . Gathered data may also include demographic data.

In another example actions sent to the user computing device permit customizing of the user experience in real time based on how the user actually is using an application . Showing an advanced setting screen instead of a basic setting screen by default is an example of a different user experience. Making automated changes to the functionality of an application is another example of customizing of the user experience e.g. customizing how an application functions on a user device based on the gathered data and user classification .

In one example the user classification process described above is implemented as an automated continuous feedback loop. Mathematical parameters are set for one or more models and the models operate as user data is received. As more feedback gathered data is received from users the user experience is increasingly tailored to each user. A model may update itself on the order of seconds or even milliseconds and after updating the model will redeploy.

In one example the users themselves can change the output decision mapping used by classification server . For example each user may indicate actions that the user likes or does not like so that functions or future actions may be changed . New actions may be received from classification server that consider these user likes and dislikes or other user selection of model parameters even as may be stored on and received from another server such as server .

Some examples of tools that may be used to collect data are now discussed. From the client side e.g. from one or more applications on a user s phone data may be collected by an application regarding behavioral statistics e.g. time spent using a feature and options that are set by the user . This data is sent to classification server for analysis and classification as discussed above. Based on this analysis and a determination of a non technical user category being applicable to the user an action may be sent e.g. in order to set user backups of the user device to occur every month .

In one embodiment classification server can assign probabilities for each user category e.g. one category is an advanced user another category is an infrequent user and yet another category is a non technical user . For example server might determine based on a score such as a probability value e.g. that it is 80 assured that the most appropriate user category is an advanced user category. The choosing of the score e.g. a probability value may be done through mathematical modeling e.g. use of statistical techniques . Models are used to turn behavioral characteristics and statistics into probabilistic scores e.g. using machine learning techniques . The models may be created by machine learning techniques. Once one or more models process gathered data the outputs from the model s are a set of probabilities. Classification server assigns each of these probabilities to a user category . In one embodiment an output of this modeling and analysis is an action as discussed above. Examples of actions include a change to a setting a sending of an email a changing of a page a presenting to the user of an offer for purchase of a good or service etc. Examples of machine learning techniques and models include neural networks support vector machines random forests adaptive standard additive model fuzzy systems and deep belief networks.

In one embodiment classification server can use defined thresholds such that if a user clears a given threshold value e.g. a user having a score of 80 on a zero to 100 score with a threshold value being 70 for a given user category then classification server knows with a statistical confidence that the user is in this user category. This information will then be injected back into the model for future analysis done when new gathered data is received.

After a user is assigned to a user category that assignment becomes part of the feedback loop discussed above. From that point on if the user performs user actions on a user device that are contrary to the user category that has been defined or associated with that user then these usage statistics and data will be brought into the model for the next running of the model e.g. the model may be run again in less than 10 seconds or even less than 1 second . In one embodiment a user category is assigned to a user the user behavior is observed and then analysis is done to see if the user s behavior is inconsistent with the user category that has been assigned. If it is inconsistent then the model is run again and the user category is changed to a different category.

In one example if the model runs every couple of seconds in that time period since the last model run there will be new user behavior and new user actions. A few seconds e.g. less than 10 seconds later there will be a distinctly different model based on different data that has been gathered from the user and from yet other users of other different computing devices . The threshold scores for each user category are recalculated and users re assigned to different categories as may be appropriate for each user. The model automatically continues to re evaluate what the user has recently done and to recalculate probabilities.

In this description various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor such as a microprocessor. Alternatively or in combination the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry with or without software instructions such as using an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA . Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions or in combination with software instructions. Thus the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer readable media used to actually effect the distribution.

At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied at least in part in software. That is the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor such as a microprocessor executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory such as ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory cache or a remote storage device.

Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system middleware service delivery platform SDK Software Development Kit component web services or other specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API Application Programming Interface . The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.

A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory and or cache. Portions of this software and or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically just in time when needed for execution. Thus it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.

Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non recordable type media such as volatile and non volatile memory devices read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory devices floppy and other removable disks magnetic disk storage media optical storage media e.g. Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROMS Digital Versatile Disks DVDs etc. among others. The computer readable media may store the instructions.

The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical optical acoustical or other forms of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. However propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.

In general a tangible machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides e.g. stores information in a form accessible by a machine e.g. a computer network device personal digital assistant manufacturing tool any device with a set of one or more processors etc. .

In various embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof.

In the foregoing specification the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense.
