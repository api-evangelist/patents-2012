The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates to a high flow rate self calibrating aerosol dilution device and a sampling system for providing particulate samples to a particle counter. The invention can be used for testing High Efficiency Particulate Air HEPA filters by collecting samples up and downstream of the HEPA filter under test and comparing upstream and downstream sample counts.

As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 7 536 898 issued to Owen when particle counters measure aerosol concentrations above their operating range the detectors can become saturated or exhibit undesirable nonlinear behavior. The drawback from these measurement devices arises when they are used to measure aerosol concentrations above the instrument s dynamic range.

To overcome this obstacle dilution techniques have been employed where the aerosol concentration is diluted by separating the flow path of an aerosol into a filtered path and a non filtered path. In the filtered path a filter absorbs the aerosol particles to create relatively pure air which is then mixed with the unfiltered aerosol to create a diluted mix. The diluted mix is then channeled to a particle counter and the collected count data extrapolated to arrive at a particle concentration which depends on the actual dilution factor created by the diluter. It is often difficult to determine the dilution factor accurately leading to inaccurate and disputed counts.

The current generation of particle counters is typically designed to measure particulates in clean rooms also known as white rooms and obtain statistically significant counts based on relatively high sample volumes typically of the order of cubic feet. Consequently such counters are easily overwhelmed if exposed to high particulate counts. However it is particularly advantageous to use such particle counters because when operating properly they provide very accurate particle counts. Therefore a dilution and sampling system that can be used in combination with modern particle counters is highly desired.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 998 252 issued to Huza et al. describes an apparatus and method for certifying a filter in a containment system without decontaminating the containment system prior to certification. The apparatus generally comprises a valve assembly selectable between at least three operational states. A first state prevents flow through a port of a housing. A second state fluidly couples the port to test equipment necessary to test a filter disposed within the housing. A third state seals the port but fluidly couples the test equipment to a decontamination system.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 785 408 issued to Jordan Sr. et al describes a particle collector made up of a housing defining an enclosed chamber. An inlet opening in the housing provides fluid communication between a source of gas and particles and the chamber and an outlet opening provides fluid communication between the chamber and the exterior of the housing. The outlet opening is connected to a pump for drawing gas and particles through the housing from the inlet opening to the outlet opening. A collecting member having an adhesive on at least a portion of the surface is disposed in the chamber between the inlet opening and the outlet opening. The adhesive surface of the collecting member is positioned adjacent to the inlet opening. When gas and particles are drawn through the housing the inlet opening directs a stream of gas and particles at the surface of the collecting member. Particles having an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of less than about 2.5 m 2.5 microns are captured.

While such technologies as described above have some merit there is a need for improved dilution and sampling apparatus to enable for example the testing of HEPA filters using a new generation of particulate counters that normally measure particulates in clean rooms.

A system for testing the efficiency of a test HEPA filter includes improved dilution and sampling systems. The dilution system processes samples collected upstream of the test HEPA filter. The dilution system has a test portion and a calibration portion. The calibration portion aids in determining the dilution ratio of the test portion thereby rendering the dilution system self calibrating and allowing an accurate particle count upstream and downstream from the test HEPA filter. The sampling system receives upstream samples via the dilution system and downstream samples collected directly downstream of the test HEPA filter. The sampling system incorporates a flow rate balancing system to ensure accurate counts with respect to samples collected upstream and downstream of the test HEPA filter. The sampling system allows the use of a new generation of accurate static particle counters normally fitted with relatively weak fans to draw in samples from clean rooms and the like for counting in the present dynamic HEPA filter test system. The use of such counters in the present system is achieved by connecting the sampling system to both the inlet and exhaust outlet of a particle counter.

This invention is directed to a high flow rate self calibrating aerosol dilution device and a sampling system for providing particulate samples to a particle counter. The invention can be used for testing High Efficiency Particulate Air HEPA filters by collecting samples up and downstream of the HEPA filter under test and comparing upstream and downstream sample counts to calculate HEPA filter efficiency.

For the purposes of this invention disclosure the terms line and pathway are regarded as equivalent terms in addition the terms particle Measuring system and particle counter are regarded as equivalent terms.

Broadly the invention is a system for testing the efficiency of a test HEPA filter. The testing system comprises improved dilution and sampling systems for particular use with a new generation of highly accurate static particle counters typically used to count particles in clean rooms and the like. The dilution system is capable of test and self calibration modes of operation to improve accuracy of particle counters. The dilution system processes samples collected upstream of the test HEPA filter. The calibrated portion aids in determining the dilution ratio of the test portion thereby rendering the dilution system self calibrating. The sampling system receives upstream samples via the dilution system and downstream samples collected directly downstream of the test HEPA filter. The sampling system incorporates a flow rate balancing system to ensure accurate counts with respect to samples collected upstream and downstream of the test HEPA filter. The sampling system works well with static particle counters fitted with relatively weak fans to normally draw in samples for counting. In this invention the sampling system is connected to both the inlet and exhaust outlet of a particle counter.

Referring to the Figures of which shows a schematic diagram of an overall HEPA filter test system which includes a dilution system and sampling system of this invention. The dilution system has an inlet and an outlet . In one embodiment the outlet of the dilution system is coupled to a sampling system via pathway as shown in . The sampling system is operatively coupled to a particle measuring system . The dilution system and sampling system respectively receive samples upstream and downstream of a test chuck . The test chuck includes a test HEPA filter under test shown schematically in . The efficiency of the test HEPA filter is determined by comparing the particulate counts upstream and downstream of the test HEPA filter which may be located in a test chuck .

Still referring to system air is directed through a system air HEPA filter where the system air is filtered of particulates if present in the system air. The filtered system air is directed along conduit pathway towards test chuck . An aerosol generator provides an aerosol the equivalent of particulate matter which is directed to conduit pathway where the aerosol is mixed with the filtered system air at pathway junction to provide a mixture of filtered system air and aerosol hereinafter referred to as undiluted aerosol. The undiluted aerosol is directed along upstream sampling line to the test chuck and the test HEPA filter therein. The upstream sampling line is located upstream of the test chuck and more specifically extends between junction from the aerosol generator and the test chuck .

As shown in at junction in the upstream sampling line undiluted aerosol is directed both towards test chuck and along upstream sampling line to the dilution system . The test HEPA filter located in test chuck filters undiluted aerosol arriving at test chuck inlet and the filtered undiluted aerosol is directed from test chuck outlet and thence along outlet pathway to a system outlet . Samples of filtered undiluted aerosol are drawn off downstream of test chuck at junction on outlet pathway and directed along pathway to the sampling system . It should be noted that pathways and respectively deliver upstream and downstream samples to the sampling system see .

In broad terms the dilution system forms part of a HEPA filter test system for testing the efficiency of a test HEPA filter . The dilution system comprises a test portion comprising a first means for diluting an upstream sample and a calibrate portion for calibrating the test portion the calibrate portion comprises a second means for diluting an upstream sample. The test portion and calibrate portion are operably linked such that king calibration of the test portion an upstream sample first enters the calibrate portion and from the calibrate portion the sample enters the test portion and during test mode only the test portion is used to dilute upstream samples.

An exemplar non limiting embodiment of the dilution system is shown in . Undiluted aerosol is drawn into the dilution system via upstream sampling line . The dilution system comprises a test portion and a calibrate portion . A valve such as a three way ball valve directs the undiluted aerosol to the test portion or the calibrate portion of the dilution system moreover undiluted aerosol can be sent to the calibrate portion and thence through the test portion as explained below. The test portion is generally used to obtain test data on the efficiency of the test HEPA filter and the calibrate portion is used to determine the dilution ratio of the test portion of the dilution system .

The test portion is essentially a parallel circuit as shown in which is made up of a test portion HEPA filter a first test portion restriction valve which may be a needle valve a second test portion restriction valve which can be a modified union tee shown in more detail in and a test portion differential pressure gauge for measuring the pressure differential across the second test portion restriction valve . The test portion differential pressure gauge can be any suitable pressure gauge such as but not limited to a magnehelic pressure differential gauge which is available from Dwyer Instruments Inc. The second test portion restriction valve is located parallel to the test portion HEPA filter and first test portion restriction valve . The first test portion restriction valve is in series with respect to the test portion HEPA filter . In the first test portion restriction valve is shown downstream of the test portion HEPA filter but it can also be located upstream of the test portion HEPA filter but downstream is preferred. While the first test portion restriction valve is shown parallel to and not in series with respect to the second test portion restriction valve it still follows that any adjustment to the first test portion restriction valve will impact on the flow rate of undiluted aerosol through the second test portion restriction valve .

In test mode of the dilution system undiluted aerosol is directed into the test portion by adjusting valve to direct output from upstream sampling line along pathway where the undiluted aerosol is separated at a first test portion junction into test portion filtered path and a test portion unfiltered but flow restricted path . The paths and are essentially in parallel with respect to each other. The test portion restricted path includes the second test portion restriction valve which in a preferred embodiment is a modified union tee as shown in . The test portion filtered path includes the test portion HEPA filter and the first test portion restriction valve located in series with respect to the test portion HEPA filter . The second test portion restriction valve allows a measured amount of undiluted aerosol to bypass the test portion HEPA filter . The first test portion restriction valve is adjusted which controls the flow through test portion HEPA filter and hence also through second test portion restriction valve . As long as the pressure across the second test portion restriction valve is kept at a selected set point a set dilution is maintained. The test portion HEPA filter removes the particles in the undiluted aerosol to create pure air which is directed along test portion filtered path . The second test portion restriction valve restricts flow of undiluted aerosol and the restricted flow of undiluted aerosol from the second test portion restriction valve is directed to second test portion junction and mixed with pure air from test portion HEPA filter .

The test portion also includes a test line which in turn includes a three way valve see . The three way valve can be any suitable valve such as a three way ball valve. The three way valve can be used to direct output from the calibrate portion of the dilution system to the test portion of the dilution system via test line such that during the self calibration mode of operation undiluted aerosol is processed consecutively through the calibrate portion and then the test portion of dilution system and thence onto sampling system for particle counting.

During the self calibration mode of operation particle counts are obtained using both portions and to calibrate the test portion of the dilution system . Then particle counts made using only the test portion are compared to the particle counts obtained using both portions and to calibrate the test portion of the dilution system . It is preferred that during the self calibration mode of operation that counts are made first based on consecutive dilution using the calibrate and test portions and and then the test portion only.

In test mode only the test portion of the diluter system is used to test samples upstream of the test chuck . Particle counts from samples collected up and downstream of the test chuck are compared to determine the efficiency of the HEPA filter in test chuck . The upstream samples are processed by the test portion of the dilution system . The downstream samples are processed directly by the sampling system see .

In one embodiment the first means for diluting an upstream sample comprises test portion HEPA filter first test portion restriction valve and second test portion restriction valve first test portion junction test portion filtered path test portion restricted path test portion filtered path and second test portion junction . However it should be understood that the first means for diluting an upstream sample can include any apparatus that provides the same functionality as the test portion . The second means for diluting a downstream sample comprises calibrate portion HEPA filter first calibrate portion restriction valve and second calibrate portion restriction valve first calibrate portion junction calibrate portion filtered path calibrate portion restricted path calibrate portion filtered path and second calibrate portion junction . However it should be understood that the second means for diluting an upstream sample can include any apparatus that provides the same functionality as the calibrate portion .

Referring to the modified union tee comprises a closed top and an interior at least partly filled with epoxy resin with optional first and second gaskets and located proximate to opposite ends of the modified union tee . A steel tubing passes through the epoxy resin and inside the steel tubing is a wire . The wire can be made out of stainless steel serves to restrict unfiltered aerosol flow through the steel tubing and hence through the modified union tee . The diameters of the steel tubing and wire therein are selected to achieve a desired degree of restriction and particle flow through the modified union tee . The amount and distribution of epoxy resin inside interior and hence inside the modified union tee is sufficient to ensure the flow of unfiltered aerosol is limited to flow through the steel tubing . The gauge of the wire is selected to further limit the flow of unfiltered aerosol through the steel tubing and hence through the modified union tee .

By comparing the counts from using both portions and with the count from using only test portion enables an operator to determine the dilution ratio of the test portion of the dilution system in effect the calibrate portion calibrates the test portion . Subsequent counts performed using just the test portion in combination with the sampling system and particle measuring system enable an operator to determine the particle count upstream of the test chuck . In normal sample test mode only the test portion is in use specifically the calibrate portion is used to calibrate the test portion of the dilution system thus making the dilution system a self calibrating dilution system.

The calibrate portion is made up of a calibrate portion HEPA filter a first calibrate portion restriction valve which may be a needle valve a second calibrate portion restriction valve which can be a modified union tee shown in more detail in and a calibrate portion differential pressure gauge for measuring the pressure differential across the second calibrate portion restriction valve . The calibrate portion differential pressure gauge can be any suitable pressure gauge such as but not limited to a magnehelic pressure differential gauge which is available from Dwyer Instruments Inc. The second calibrate portion restriction valve is located parallel to the calibrate portion HEPA filter and the first calibrate portion restriction valve . The first calibrate portion restriction valve is in series with respect to the calibrate portion HEPA filter . In the first calibrate portion restriction valve is shown downstream of the calibrate portion HEPA filter but it can also be located upstream of the calibrate portion HEPA filter but downstream is preferred. While the first calibrate portion restriction valve is shown parallel to and not in series with respect to the second calibrate portion restriction valve it still follows that any adjustment to the first calibrate portion restriction valve will impact on the flow rate of undiluted aerosol through the second calibrate portion restriction valve .

The dilution system is a self calibrating particulate dilution system. The dilution system comprises a test portion and a calibrate portion . The calibrate portion is used to lower the concentration of particulate of undiluted aerosol received from upstream sampling line via upstream sampling line see .

To calibrate the dilution system a sample of the undiluted aerosol is drawn through both the calibrate portion and the test portion . This is achieved adjusting valve to direct undiluted aerosol to and through the calibrate portion and thence into and through the test portion via valve and test line . Once the undiluted aerosol is processed by both the calibrate portion and the test portion a count is made by the sampling system in conjunction with the particle measuring system . Then the flow within the dilution system is changed by adjusting valve to direct the undiluted aerosol to only the test portion and a further count is made to provide a dilution ratio of the test portion for each particle size counted by the sampling system in conjunction with the particle measuring system and thereby calibrate the test portion of the dilution system . Following calibration of the test portion the test portion is used to supply upstream samples to the sampling system and the particle measuring system . The particle measuring system can be any suitable particle counter such as a Lasair II model particle measuring system the current version of which is a 1.0 cf m cubic feet minute equivalent to 60 cf hr particle counter with the ability to count particles as small as 0.1 m.

In more detail as shown in undiluted aerosol is directed into the calibrate portion by adjusting valve to direct output from upstream sampling line along pathway where the undiluted aerosol is separated at a first calibrate portion junction into calibrate portion filtered path and a calibrated portion unfiltered but flow restricted path . The paths and are essentially in parallel with respect to each other. The calibrated portion restricted path includes the second calibrate portion restriction valve which in a preferred embodiment is a modified union tee as shown in . The calibrate portion filtered path includes the calibrate portion HEPA filter and the first calibrate portion restriction valve located in series with respect to the calibrate portion HEPA filter . The second calibrate portion restriction valve allows a measured amount of undiluted aerosol to bypass the calibrate portion HEPA filter . The first calibrate portion restriction valve is adjusted to control the flow through calibrate portion HEPA filter and hence also through second calibrate portion restriction valve . As long as the pressure across the second calibrate portion restriction valve is kept at a selected set point a set dilution is maintained. The calibrate portion HEPA filter removes the particles in the undiluted aerosol to create pure air which is directed along calibrated portion filtered path . The second calibrate portion restriction valve restricts flow of undiluted aerosol and the restricted flow of undiluted aerosol from the second calibrate portion restriction valve is directed to second calibrate portion junction and mixed with pure air from calibrate portion HEPA filter .

In test mode the sampling system of the invention processes samples collected upstream and downstream of the HEPA filter which can be held in a test chuck . The sampling system works in conjunction with a particle measuring system . Upstream and downstream samples are respectively received via pathway conduit pathways and and are separately directed to the particle measuring system . In a preferred embodiment the sampling system is a high flow sampling system with pressure balancing more specifically in combination with the particle measuring system the sampling system ensures particle counts of upstream and downstream samples are performed under essentially the same pressure conditions to ensure accurate and meaningful particle counts.

The particle measuring system defines a sample inlet and an exhaust outlet the particle measuring system typically includes an internal sampling fan shown schematically in . Such fans are typically relatively weak because they are used to draw in air samples for particulate counts in clean rooms sometimes referred to as white rooms and thus do not work against for example a vacuum. The present invention solves this problem by connecting the sampling system to both the sample inlet and also to the exhaust outlet of the particle measuring system .

Referring to the sampling system shown in and using the downstream sampling line as a reference point the downstream samples arrives via line and negotiates a downstream sample line restrictor valve which acts as a sample flow balance valve and may take the form of an adjustable needle valve a downstream sample line union tee a three way valve and a three way ball valve which is used to direct the downstream sample to the particle measuring system via pathway leading to the inlet of the particle measuring system . The parts and are in series and collectively define the downstream sample receiving line of sampling system . The three way valve switches the sampling system between upstream samples received via line and downstream samples received via line . In this sense the three way valve is a sample selector valve allowing the sampler system to switch between counting upstream and downstream samples with respect to test HEPA filter .

A count is made by the particle measuring system and the downstream sample exits the particle measuring system at its exhaust outlet and is directed along exhaust outlet pathway to a union tee and thence through a union cross to a sample system exit line connected to a vacuum line . The parts and are in series and collectively define the sample control section of sampling system see . The downstream sample line restrictor valve acts as a balance valve ensuring that the flow rate of the downstream sampling line is the same as the flow rate of upstream samples through line from diluter system. thereby balancing the flow rate through the rotameters and and the particle counter this balancing is best achieved when the particle counter is either switched off or otherwise isolated from the sample system it should be noted that the terms particle measuring system and particle counter are regarded as equivalent terms .

A downstream coupled rotameter is located between the union tee and line . The downstream rotameter defines opposite base and top ends and respectively. More specifically the base of the downstream rotameter is attached to union tee and the top of the downstream rotameter is attached to line . Line includes an elbow joint . The downstream rotameter measures flow rate between the downstream union tee and line . More specifically the base of the downstream rotameter is attached to a downstream union tee and the top of the upstream rotameter is attached to line which connects to a union cross and thence to vacuum line via sample exit line . Thus the downstream rotameter is operably linked to vacuum line . The downstream rotameter measures flow rate between the downstream union tee and line and hence between the downstream union tee and vacuum line . During upstream counts the three way ball valve is used to direct the upstream sample to the particle measuring system via pathway .

The sampling system further comprises an upstream union tee and an upstream coupled rotameter associated with upstream samples received via line . The upstream union tee is operably coupled to the three way valve via line . The upstream union tee and line collectively define an upstream sample receiving line of sampling system . The upstream rotameter defines opposite base and top ends and respectively. The upstream rotameter is located between the union tee of upstream sample receiving line and line . Line includes an elbow joint . More specifically the base of the upstream rotameter is attached to an upstream union tee and the top of the upstream rotameter is attached to line which connects to a union cross and thence vacuum line via sample exit line . Thus the upstream rotameter is operably linked to vacuum line . The upstream rotameter measures flow rate between the upstream union tee and line and hence between the upstream union tee and vacuum line .

The flow rate across the downstream rotameter can be adjusted by for example adjusting the downstream sample line restrictor valve to ensure that the flow rate across the downstream rotameter is balanced and equal to the flow rate across the upstream rotameter to ensure meaningful readings of the downstream samples and diluted aerosol samples respectively received via pathways and by the particle measuring system .

In more detail the sampling system draws upstream and downstream air samples respectively from lines and . More specifically the three way valve functions as a sample selector valve directing upstream or downstream samples to valve and thence onto the particle measuring system . Prior to actual sampling the sample system is balanced to provide equal flow rates with respect to both upstream and downstream samples this is objectively achieved by balancing the flow rates through the upstream and downstream coupled rotameters and using for example line restrictor valve which acts as a sample flow balance valve and may take the form of an adjustable needle valve. The balancing adjustment with respect to the flow rates through the up and downstream rotameters and can be performed when the particle measuring system is switched off or when there is no flow of upstream or downstream samples to the particle measuring system . The vacuum line is also adjusted to ensure the vacuum applied to both the upstream and downstream sample lines are sufficient to achieve a flow rate through each rotameter and at about 5 to 60 higher than the flow rate of the particle measuring system . A flow rate through each rotameter and at about 10 to 50 higher than the flow rate of the particle measuring system is also suitable.

The flow rates through the up and downstream rotameters and are a function of the strength of the vacuum applied by vacuum line . Balancing i.e. equilibrating the flow rate through up and downstream coupled rotameters and is achieved using valve . More specifically the flow rate leading from line is set by the dilution system thus the valve is used to adjust the flow rate from line associated with the downstream sample path to equal that from line . The flow rate for each rotameter is preferably set to be in the range from 10 to 50 higher than the flow rate of the particle measuring system and as stated the flow rates are equilibrated using valve . A suitable flow rate for each rotameter and is between 15 and 30 above the flow rate of the particle measuring system .

For a particle measuring system factory rated at 60 cf hr 60 cubic feet per hour the flow rate through each of the up and downstream rotameters and are set to range between 66 and 90 cf hr with 80 cf hr preferred with respect to each rotameter i.e. in this non limiting example 25 above the flow rate of a particle measuring system with a 60 cf hr rating . Table 1 in shows a working example of how the flow rates through the up and downstream rotameters and may vary with respect to a particle measuring system rated at 1 cubic foot volume per minute sample rate and a flow rate through the rotameters set at 25 above the flow rate of the particle measuring system in this instance factory set at 1 cf min equating to 60 cf hr . It should be understood that the flow rate through the particle measuring system can vary according to the manufacturers specifications but current particle measuring systems are typically rated at 1 cf min one cubic foot per minute sampling rate .

Another feature of the sampling system is that it works well with particle counters with relatively weak internal sampling fans. This is achieved by connecting the sampling system to both the sample inlet and also to the exhaust outlet of the particle measuring system . By connecting to the inlet and exhaust the internal fan of the particle measuring system is not required to work against the vacuum generated by the vacuum line . This novel setup enables the sampling system to work in conjunction with particle counters with weak internal fans.

Referring to it will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that sampling system can function without valve so long as pathway is connected to valve or its functional equivalent. However when valve is used and when valve is switched such that the particle measuring system is isolated and drawing sample from union tee the particle measuring system will be drawing sample from its own exhaust. Because the particle measuring system is designed for clean room use its exhaust is filtered by an internal ultra high efficiency particulate filter also shown in before exhausting through outlet . When switched into this mode of operation the particle measuring system will zero out and report no counts for any or all particle sizes. The ability to achieve a zero readout on the particulate measuring system assures proper operation of the unit and that no leaks are in pathway or its connections at and valve . Also sampling system can function without union tee so long as pathway is connected to union cross or a functional equivalent part.

The invention being thus described it will be evident that the same may be varied in many ways by a routineer in the applicable arts. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the claims.
