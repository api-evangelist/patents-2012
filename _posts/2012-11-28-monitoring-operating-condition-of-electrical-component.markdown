title: Monitoring operating condition of electrical component
abstract: Among other things, one or more techniques and/or systems are provided for monitoring an operating condition of an electrical component, such as electrical switchgear. In one example, temperatures associated with an electrical conductor connection within the electrical component may be evaluated against one or more expected temperatures curves derived from a linear regression model to determine whether the electrical conductor connection has failed or is starting to fail. In another example, temperature readings may be monitored to determine whether a temperature reading at one location is out of sync with temperature readings at other locations. An electrical conductor connection associated with a location of the out of sync temperature may be determined as faulty. In another example, a Euclidean distance model and/or a correlation coefficient model may be used to identify a faulty electrical conductor connection. In this way, failure and/or potential failure of the electrical component may be predicted.

Electrical power systems comprise various electrical components such as electrical switchgear. Electrical switchgear may comprise electrical conductors electrical conductor connections disconnect switches fuses and or circuit breakers used to control and protect electrical equipment. At least some portions of electric switchgear may sustain damage over time due to temperature conditions electrical abrasion mechanical operation corrosion and other operating conditions. In one example a loose electrical conductor connection e.g. electrical connection between two or more electrical conductors may increase resistance at the connection. Accordingly when relatively high current flows through the loose electrical connection excess heat may be generated e.g. from the increased resistance which may lead to undesired results. For example over time excessive temperatures can damage insulation material melt conductors lead to oxidation of contacts etc. of electrical switchgear

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Among other things one or more systems and or techniques for monitoring an operating condition of an electrical component are provided herein e.g. monitoring electrical switchgear which may comprise one or more electrical conductors and or one or more electrical conductor connections . In one embodiment of monitoring an operating condition of an electrical component an alert component may be configured to generate one or more expected temperature curves based upon a linear regression model. The linear regression model may generate an expected temperature curve based upon one or more ambient temperatures associated with the electrical component e.g. switchgear and or a set of load currents associated with one or more electrical conductors such as wires or buses associated with the electrical component for example. The expected temperature curve may comprise a curve that represents temperatures that may be expected during normal operation of the electrical component e.g. the curve may represent various temperature values that may increase during peak usages times during the day and or various temperature values that may decrease during low usage at off peak hours . A warning threshold curve may be generated based upon a first standard deviation e.g. a 3 sigma from the expected temperature curve. An alarm threshold curve may be generated based upon a second standard deviation e.g. a 6 sigma from the expected temperature curve. In this way a set of temperatures associated with the one or more electrical conductors e.g. temperatures along a phase A electric conductor temperatures along a phase B electrical conductor temperatures along a phase C electrical conductor etc. may be monitored based upon the warning threshold curve the alarm threshold curve and or other curves in order to determine an operating condition of the electrical component. For example if a temperature exceeds the warning threshold curve then a warning may be provided which may provide early detection of a potential future failure of the electrical component.

In one embodiment of monitoring an operating condition of an electrical component a coefficient evaluation component may be configured to evaluate at least some temperature measurements from a temperature sensor against a correlation coefficient model to determine whether one or more of such temperature measurements are out of sync with one another and or otherwise aberrant. An out of sync temperature measurement at a temperature measuring location may for example indicate that an electrical conductor connection associated with the temperature measuring location may be a hot spot indicative of a faulty electrical connector connection for example. In one example of utilizing the correlation coefficient model temperature reading behavior e.g. one or more temperature measurements along a single path e.g. an electrical conductor such as a bus having a relatively similar load and or current along the electrical conductor may be evaluated to determine whether temperature readings e.g. measurements along the path are behaving similarly e.g. substantially similar measurements may be expected because the current along the path may be relatively similar for substantially all temperature measuring locations . For example correlation coefficients may be derived for temperature measurement pairings along a path of a particular phase e.g. a main bus temperature and an upper bushing temperature measured along a phase A electrical conductor a main bus temperature and a cable connection temperature measured along a phase A electrical conductor and or other temperature measurement pairings measured along a phase A electrical conductor . Correlation coefficients associated with a temperature reading e.g. measurement may be compared against correlation coefficients of other temperature readings e.g. measurements to determine whether an electrical conductor connection is faulty e.g. a faulty electrical conductor connection may have caused the temperature increase . Because temperatures along the path should be relatively similar e.g. correlation coefficients close to 1.0 if one or more correlation coefficients of a temperature reading deviate from 1.0 beyond a threshold value then the electrical conductor connection associated with the temperature measuring location may be regarded as faulty. In another example of utilizing the correlation coefficient model correlation coefficients of temperature measurements of a temperature sensor along multiple phases may be correlated together to determine whether an electrical conductor connection on a phase is faulty. It may be appreciated that while determinations relative to electrical conductor connections are referred to herein the instant application including the scope of the appended claims is not intended to be so limited. For example the discussions determinations etc. may also and or alternatively be applicable to electrical conductors. Accordingly at least for some aspects described herein e.g. with regard to electrical conductor connection and electrical conductor may be used interchangeably.

In one embodiment of monitoring operating conditions of an electrical component a Euclidean Distance ED evaluation component may use a Euclidean Distance model to evaluate temperature measurements at a temperature measuring location e.g. measurements by a temperature sensor for a phase A phase B and phase C to determine whether the temperature measurements are out of sync with one another e.g. a temperature measurement of the phase A may be out of sync with temperature measurements of the phase B and phase C which may indicate that an electrical conductor connection e.g. a conductor of phase A may be faulty. In one example of utilizing the Euclidean distance model temperature measurements for one or more phases by a temperature sensor are evaluated while taking into account different load currents of the phases to determine whether such temperature measurements correlate. That is Euclidean distances are calculated for temperature measurement parings of the temperature measurements e.g. a first Euclidean distance for phase A and phase B a second Euclidean distance for a phase A and a phase C etc. . If Euclidean distances of respective temperature measurement pairings are not similar e.g. above a threshold standard deviation then an electrical conductor connection e.g. a phase A electrical conductor associated with a temperature measuring location of an out of sync temperature may be determined as faulty. In another example of utilizing the Euclidean distance model Euclidean distances are calculated for temperature measurements along a path having a similar load current along the path. If the Euclidean distances associated with temperature readings do not correlate then the electrical conductor connection where the temperature was measured may be determined as faulty.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

As provided herein an operating condition of an electrical component such as electrical switchgear for example may be monitored for failure and or monitored for early detection of a potential future failure. In one embodiment one or more expected temperature curves may be generated based upon a linear regression model using an ambient temperature and or a set of load currents associated with electrical conductors such as buses of the electrical component. Temperatures associated with the electrical conductors may be monitored based upon threshold curves such as warning and or alarm threshold curves to determine whether such temperatures correspond to expected temperatures of the electrical conductors during normal operation. Because an expected temperature curve may take into account changes in temperature e.g. relatively high temperatures during peak usage during the day the expected temperature curve may provide relatively accurate consistent and or early fault detection compared with other monitoring techniques that may merely use a static temperature threshold value. In another embodiment a Euclidean distance model may be used to correlate Euclidean distances of temperature measurements associated with temperature readings to determine whether a temperature measurement at a first location behaves similarly with temperature measurements at other locations e.g. temperature measurements for 3 phases may be correlated with one another while taking into account load current differences of respective phases . In another embodiment a correlation coefficient model may be used to compare correlation coefficients of temperature measurements associated with temperature readings to determine whether a temperature measurement at a first location behaves similarly with temperature measurements at other locations e.g. temperature measurements along an electrical conductor having a relatively uniform load current may be expected to have similar temperatures .

One embodiment of monitoring operating conditions of an electrical component is illustrated by an exemplary method in and an example of an exemplary electrical component is illustrated in . It may be appreciated that the electrical component may comprise various types of electrical devices such as electrical switchgear a three phase switch substation equipment a device comprising one or more conductors etc. For example the electrical component may comprise a main bus component an upper bushing component a lower bushing component a cable connection component and or other components not illustrated.

The electrical component may comprise one or more sensors such as temperature sensors and or load current sensors. A first temperature sensor may be configured to obtain ambient temperatures associated with the electrical component . A second temperature sensor may be configured to obtain main bus temperatures associated with the main bus component e.g. a first main bus temperature associated with a phase A electrical conductor a second main bus temperature associated with a phase B electrical conductor and or a third main bus temperature associated with a phase C electrical conductor . A third temperature sensor may be configured to obtain upper bushing temperatures associated with the upper bushing component e.g. a first upper bushing temperature associated with the phase A electrical conductor a second upper bushing temperature associated with the phase B electrical conductor and or a third upper bushing temperature associated with the phase C electrical conductor . A fourth temperature sensor may be configured to obtain lower bushing temperatures associated with the lower bushing component e.g. a first lower bushing temperature associated with the phase A electrical conductor a second lower bushing temperature associated with the phase B electrical conductor and or a third lower bushing temperature associated with the phase C electrical conductor . A fifth temperature sensor may be configured to obtain cable connection temperatures associated with the cable connection component e.g. a first cable connection temperature associated with the phase A electrical conductor a second cable connection temperature associated with the phase B electrical conductor and or a third cable connection temperature associated with the phase C electrical conductor . A current sensor may be configured to obtain a set of loads currents associated with one or more conductors such as buses and or wires of the electrical component e.g. a first load current associated with the phase A electrical conductor a second load current associated with the phase B electrical conductor a third load current associated with the phase C electrical conductor . In this way temperature and or current measurements associated with the electrical component may be used to monitor operating conditions of the electrical component .

In one example of monitoring operating conditions of the electrical component one or more ambient temperatures associated with the electrical component may be obtained at . For example the first temperature sensor may obtain a set of ambient temperatures associated with the electrical component which may be used as an ambient temperature array for a linear regression model. The linear regression model may use the ambient temperature array to create one or more expected temperature curves for evaluating the operation of the electrical component . At a set of load currents associated with one or more electrical conductors of the electrical component may be obtained. For example the current sensor may measure load current s associated with the phase A electrical conductor the phase B electrical conductor and or the phase C electrical conductor .

At one or more expected temperature curves may be generated based upon a linear regression model using the ambient temperature e.g. an ambient temperature array and or the set of load currents. For example a first expected temperature curve may be generated for the upper bushing component and or the lower bushing component a second expected temperature curve may be generated for the main bus component and or a third expected temperature curve may be generated for the cable connection component . It may be appreciated that one example of an expected temperature curve is illustrated in example of .

It may be appreciated that one example of a linear regression model is illustrated in example of . In one example the linear regression model T A I B T T may be based upon a current array coefficient A a load current array I an ambient temperature coefficient B an ambient temperature array T and or a reference temperature coefficient T . The load current array I may be based upon the set of load currents measured by the current sensor for example. The load current array I may take into account a time delay that corresponds to an association between a peak current and a peak temperature e.g. the peak temperature may occur after the peak current . The ambient temperature array T may be based upon a set of ambient temperatures measured by the first temperature sensor for example. The ambient temperature array T may take into account a time delay corresponding to a peak ambient temperature. The current array coefficient A the ambient temperature coefficient B and or the reference temperature coefficient T may be coefficients used by the linear regression model to estimate one or more expected temperature curve e.g. various prediction models may be used to modify the coefficients so that relatively accurate expected temperatures curves may be estimated which may take into account various factors such as seasonality for example . In this way the one or more expected temperature curve may correspond to normal operating temperatures that may be expected for the electric component over time.

One or more threshold curves may be generated based upon the expected temperature curve. Such threshold curves may be used to evaluate temperatures measured from the electrical component . In one example a warning threshold curve may be generated based upon a first standard deviation e.g. a 3 sigma from the expected temperature curve at . It may be appreciated that one example of a warning threshold curve is illustrated in example of . In another example an alarm threshold curve may be generated based upon a second standard deviation e.g. a 6 sigma from the expected temperature curve. It may be appreciated that one example of an alarm threshold curve is illustrated in example of .

At a set of temperatures associated with the one or more electrical conductors e.g. temperatures associated with the phase A electrical conductor the phase B electrical conductor and or the phase C electrical conductor which are measured by the second temperature sensor the third temperature sensor the fourth temperature sensor and or the fifth temperature sensor may be monitored based upon the warning threshold curve the alarm threshold curve and or the expected temperature curve to determine an operating condition of the electrical component e.g. determine whether the electrical component is faulty and or is slowly becoming faulty .

It may be appreciated that one example of monitoring temperatures associated with an electrical component is illustrated by example in where a temperature curve is illustrated that corresponds to temperatures measured over time for a particular electrical component. In one example if a current temperature e.g. a temperature of the phase A electrical conductor measured by the third temperature sensor at the upper bushing is above the warning threshold curve then a warning notification may be created. In another example if a current temperature e.g. a temperature of the phase A electrical conductor measured at a later time by the third temperature sensor at the upper bushing is above the alarm threshold curve then an alarm notification may be created. In this way temperatures associated with the electrical component may be monitored based upon various threshold curves generated by the linear regression model which may take into account variations of expected temperature over time e.g. increases in temperature during the day and or decreases in temperature during the night based upon varying load demand over time as opposed to merely taking into account a discrete temperature value for alarm warning notification.

The alert component may be configured to generate an expected temperature curve e.g. expected temperature curve of based upon a linear regression model using the ambient temperature and or the set of load currents . In one example the linear regression model T A I B T T may be based upon a current array coefficient A a load current array I an ambient temperature coefficient B an ambient temperature array T and or a reference temperature coefficient T . The load current array I may be based upon the set of load currents and or a time delay that corresponds to an association between a peak current and a peak temperature. The ambient temperature array T may be based upon a set of ambient temperatures obtained e.g. the ambient temperature and or a time delay corresponding to a peak ambient temperature. The current array coefficient A the ambient temperature coefficient B and or the reference temperature coefficient T may be coefficients used by the linear regression model to estimate one or more expected temperature curve. In this way the expected temperature curve may correspond to normal operating temperatures that may be expected for the electric component .

The alert component may be configured to generate a warning threshold curve based upon a first standard deviation e.g. a 3 sigma from the expected temperature curve e.g. warning threshold curve of . The alert component may be configured to generate an alarm threshold curve based upon a second standard deviation e.g. a 6 sigma from the expected temperature curve e.g. alarm threshold curve of . In this way the alert component may monitor a set of temperatures associated with the one or more electrical conductors of the electrical component e.g. a temperature curve corresponding to temperatures measured over time from the electrical component based upon the expected temperature curve the warning threshold curve and or the alarm threshold curve . In one example if a current temperature within the set of temperatures rises above the warning threshold curve e.g. current temperature then a warning notification may be created. In another example if a current temperature within the set of temperatures rises above the alarm threshold curve e.g. current temperature then an alarm notification may be created.

An alert component may be configured to generate one or more expected temperature curves based upon the linear regression model . The alert component may monitor temperatures associated with the electrical component based upon the one or more expected temperature curves to determine an operating state of the electrical component. The operating state may identify whether the electrical component is operating as expected whether the electrical component has failed and or whether the electrical component may potentially fail in the future e.g. the operating condition of the electrical component is degrading over time . Because the estimation of expected temperatures may be affected by various factors such as seasonal weather and or temperature changes that may change over time the alert component may utilize different prediction models such as a first prediction model a second prediction model a third prediction model etc. for determining values of coefficients to use for the linear regression model . In one example the first prediction model may comprise values for the current array coefficient A the ambient temperature coefficient B and or the reference temperature coefficient T that are relatively accurate for colder ambient temperatures such as a winter season. The second prediction model may comprise values for the coefficients that are relatively accurate for milder ambient temperatures such as a spring season. The third prediction model may comprise values for the coefficients that are relatively accurate for warmer ambient temperatures such as a summer season.

The alert component may be configured to select a particular prediction model to use for values of the current array coefficient A the ambient temperature coefficient B and or the reference temperature coefficient T . The alert component may select a prediction model e.g. comprising values for modifying coefficients based upon standard deviation data . The standard deviation data may comprise one or more standard deviations between an expected temperature curve and measured temperatures of the electrical component over time. If a standard deviation of a current prediction model is above a threshold e.g. a 2 sigma or 3 sigma then a different prediction model may be selected to modify the coefficients of the linear regression model . In one example the alert component may use the first prediction model for three consecutive time units e.g. hours days weeks months etc. because the standard deviation between an expected temperature curve generated based upon the first prediction model and measured temperatures may be below a threshold difference of 3 sigma e.g. 1.48 for the first time unit 1.09 for the second time unit and 1.3 for the third time unit .

Because the standard deviation for the first prediction model is above the threshold of 3 sigma e.g. 4.1 for the fourth time unit the alert component may switch from the first prediction model to the second prediction model having a 2.2 standard deviation for the fourth time unit. In this way the alert component may modify coefficients of the linear regression model based upon standard deviation data between expected temperature curves generated based upon prediction models and measured temperatures of the electrical component e.g. the alert component may switch from the second prediction model to the third prediction model for a seventh time unit . It may be appreciated that the standard deviation data is merely an example of standard deviations used by the alert component e.g. root mean square RMS error data for a single phase but could comprise other types of standard deviations e.g. RMS error data for three phases . In one example if a standard deviation is above a high threshold then an alarm may be raised e.g. as opposed to modifying the linear regression model because such a relatively high standard deviation may indicate a fault with the electrical component.

In one example of detecting a faulty electrical conductor connection the coefficient evaluation component may be configured to generate a correlation coefficient model that may be used to evaluate pairings of temperature measurements to determine whether an electrical conductor connection is faulty e.g. based upon an out of sync temperature such as a hot spot measured at a temperature measuring location associated with the electrical conductor connection . The coefficient evaluation component may create the correlation coefficient model for a set of temperature measurements associated with a phase of an electrical conductor. For example the correlation coefficient model may be generated for the second temperature sensor the third temperature sensor the fourth temperature sensor and or the fifth temperatures sensor located along the phase A electrical conductor of .

The coefficient evaluation component may evaluate one or more temperature measurements e.g. pairings of temperatures from the temperature measurements measured along a phase electrical conductor against the correlation coefficient model to determine whether an electric conductor connection of a location e.g. a temperature measuring location where an out of sync temperature such as a hot spot is measured is faulty. For example the coefficient evaluation component may determine whether a first set of temperature measurements and a second set of temperature measurements are both increasing or are both decreasing. That is because load current along a phase e.g. the phase A electrical conductor of may be relatively consistent temperatures measured by temperature sensors along the phase should correlate e.g. detect increasing temperatures detect decreasing temperatures detecting relatively similar temperature values etc. . In this way the coefficient evaluation component may identify an electrical conductor connection that may be faulty. For example an electrical conductor connection at a temperature measuring location e.g. a location at which a second temperature sensor may have measured an out of sync temperature may be determined as faulty because the temperature readings at the temperature measuring location may be detecting decreasing temperatures while temperature measurements at other locations may be detecting increasing temperatures e.g. temperature readings by a third fourth and or fifth temperature sensor along the phase A electrical conductor of . In another example the coefficient evaluation component may evaluate temperature measurements based upon phase temperature measurements to determine whether an electrical conductor connection is faulty. For example an electrical conductor connection at a temperature measure location e.g. associated with a third temperature sensor may be determined as faulty based upon phase temperature measurements at temperature measure locations for the phase A B and C not correlating e.g. temperatures adjusted based upon varying loads currents along the phases A B and C that are measured by the third temperature sensor may not be similar .

In another example of detecting a faulty electrical conductor connection the ED evaluation component may be configured to generate a Euclidean distance model that may be used to evaluate pairings of phase temperature measurements to determine whether an electrical conductor connection is faulty. For example the ED evaluation component may create the Euclidean distance model for a pair of phase measurements by one or more temperature sensors e.g. temperatures associated with the phase A electrical conductor the phase B electrical conductor and or the phase C electrical conductor of .

The ED evaluation component may evaluate phase temperature measurements per temperature sensor e.g. pairings of phase temperatures from the phase temperature measurements against the Euclidean distance model to determine whether an electrical conductor connection is faulty. In one example the ED evaluation component may generate the Euclidian distance model based upon ambient temperature and or a set of load currents associated with the electrical component to compensate for differences e.g. load and or current differences between one or more phases such as a phase A a phase B and or a phase C. In this way the ED evaluation component may compare Euclidean distances between phase pairings e.g. a first Euclidean distance between a phase A temperature measurement and a phase B temperature measurement of the second temperature sensor a second Euclidean distance between the phase A temperature and a phase C temperature measurement of the second temperature sensor and or a third Euclidean distance between the phase B temperature measurement and the phase C temperature measurement of the second temperature sensor of . If the Euclidean distances between respective phase pairings deviate above a threshold then an electrical conductor connection e.g. associated with a temperature measuring location at which an out of sync temperature such as a temperature of phase A was measured may be determined as faulty e.g. Euclidean distance of phase A and phase B and the Euclidean distance of phase A and the phase C may deviate such as by a 3 sigma or a 6 sigma while Euclidean distance of phase B and phase C may not deviate . In another example the ED evaluation component may evaluate temperature measurements per electrical conductor e.g. per phase electrical conductor to determine whether an electrical conductor connection at a temperature measuring location is faulty. For example the ED evaluation component may evaluate Euclidean distances between temperature measurements along the phase A electrical conductor by the second third fourth and or fifth temperature sensor e.g. pairings of Euclidean distances of two temperature sensors . If a Euclidean distance of a temperature measurement does not correlate to Euclidean distances of other temperature measurements then an electrical conductor connection where the non correlating temperature is measured may be determined to be faulty.
