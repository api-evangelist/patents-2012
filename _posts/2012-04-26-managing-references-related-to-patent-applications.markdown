A reference management tool facilitates managing and tracking prior art references related to patent applications. The tool which can be implemented in a web services platform an individual computing device or the like provides various graphical user interfaces to enable users to track citations of references related to patent applications associate references with patent applications having similar subject matter automatically generate information disclosure statements IDSs and perform other administrative tasks related to prior art references.

A dashboard interface provides navigable links to additional interfaces and notifications of pending references pending IDSs unfinished tasks and the like. The tool can facilitate management of groups of patent applications which may be represented by matters referred to as clans. References associated with one matter in a clan can be automatically associated with other matters in the clan and or in other clans to which the matter belongs. References associated with a matter can also be pushed to associated with other matters. The tool can track IDS filings so that when automatically generating an IDS filing package the tool only cites references that have not already been disclosed in the matter. Additionally the tool can include a notification service that provides notifications to various users to inform the users of changes associated with matters references and the like.

While multiple embodiments are disclosed still other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.

While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. The intention however is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

Embodiments of the invention include a reference management tool that facilitates managing references associated with one or more patent applications. Each patent application may be associated with a matter which may be designated by a matter number e.g. a character string including numbers letters special characters or a combination thereof . The tool facilitates tracking prior art references associated with a matter. Often a patent application will be related to other patent applications according to family relationships e.g. continuations continuations in part divisions etc. . However some patent applications may have subject matter that is similar to other patent applications though they are not within the same family. Tracking references that may be relevant to applications with similar subject matter can be achieved using embodiments of the tool by associating patent applications e.g. matters with each other to form a clan. A clan is a user specified grouping of matters. For example a user e.g. patent attorney patent agent etc. may wish to include all patent applications of a family in a clan to associate unrelated patent applications with each other or some combination thereof. Embodiments of the tool facilitate associating prior art references with a matter and automatically associating the references with other matters within the clan and or within other clans with which the matter is associated. Additionally embodiments of the tool facilitate automatically generating Information Disclosure Statement IDS filing packages e.g. completed IDS forms and copies of cited references allowing for review of the completed IDS forms and cited references and providing various types of notifications to users.

The interaction server includes a number of services that provide various functionalities for managing prior art references related to patent applications. A prior art reference referred to herein as reference can include any type of information that is or may be considered prior art with respect to a patent application. Examples of references include United States U.S. patents U.S. patent applications foreign i.e. non U.S. patents foreign patent applications non patent literature e.g. articles books web pages images diagrams speeches etc. and the like. According to embodiments the interaction server can include services such as identification services that handle user authentications and permissions interface services that facilitate interaction with other systems such as for example docketing systems DM systems and the like notification services that facilitate providing notifications to users services that facilitate adding references to the database services that facilitate generating completed IDS forms services that facilitate generating IDS filing packages services that facilitate management of clans e.g. associating matters with clans pushing references between clans etc. and any number of other types of services that can be used to facilitate embodiments of the various features and functionalities described herein.

The interaction server communicates with a web server which provides various application interfaces to a user via the browser . The web server can be any type of web server that can interact with a browser to present an interface e.g. graphical user interface to a user and may implement for example a web services platform. An interface can include any type of suitable window interaction region dialog box or the like. In embodiments the web server can interact with any number of different browsers at any given time and can interact with browsers over any number of different types of communication networks such as for example a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a combination of networks or the like.

Additionally the interaction server communicates with the database . In embodiments the database can be any type of database suitable for storing information associated with references matters clans and the like. For example the database can be a relational database a table a multidimensional data cube a number of related databases or the like. According to embodiments the database can store descriptive data related to references e.g. metadata references links to references information associated with clans e.g. clan names clan descriptions etc. associations between references and matters associations between clans and matters user permissions historical information e.g. information associated with IDSs that have been filed actions performed by users etc. and the like. In some embodiments information related to matters can be retrieved from the docketing system and can be maintained in the docketing system . In other embodiments such information can be replicated on the database . In embodiments all of the different types of data described above can be maintained on a single database or set of databases.

In operation a user can log in to the reference management tool by using a web browser to navigate to a web page hosted by the web server . Once logged in the interaction server can provide interfaces to the user via the web server . In embodiments the type of interface and or the features presented on the interface can be determined according to the user s permissions. Permissions can include any number of different types of static or dynamic data structures that associate a particular user with a set of authorizations.

Additionally a user may edit descriptive information corresponding to references by selecting the EDIT REFERENCE S option . Any number of other options for customizing the user s experience can be included in addition to or in lieu of the options depicted in . For example in embodiments the customization interface can include a CITED BY EXAMINER option that when selected facilitates entry of information associated with a reference that was cited by an examiner in an office action or other office communication e.g. a letter an examiner interview or the like .

The add references interface also includes an interaction region . As illustrated in the interaction region includes an ADD button for refreshing the interaction region so that a new reference can be added a matter indicator that indicates the matter to which the new reference is to be associated a reference type indicator and a number of input fields and for receiving descriptive data corresponding to the reference. In embodiments the matter indicator can include an input field that allows a user to input a matter with which a new reference is to be associated. The matter input field may include a drop down menu or other listing of selectable options that allows the users to select a matter. In embodiments as information is added to input fields in the interaction region corresponding summary information can be automatically populated in the summary region . For instance as a reference title is entered into a title field in the interaction region the title may appear in the summary region e.g. character by character upon completion of entry and the like .

In embodiments input fields can be mapped to database fields and in embodiments can vary based on the type of reference that is being added. Additionally examples of data to be entered into input fields can be presented input fields can be assigned various properties e.g. required conditional optional and the like. In embodiments any number of different types of input fields can be used to receive descriptive data related to references. For example in embodiments an input field can be provided for receiving information about an origin of the reference. That is a user adding a reference can include data describing how the reference was discovered or determined to be related to the matter. For example a user may enter data indicating that the reference was cited by an examiner in an office action was cited in an International Search Report was cited in a foreign office action was uncovered in a private prior art search was submitted by an associated inventor or the like. In embodiments input fields can also be used to receive information regarding the relationship of a reference to a case. For example in embodiments a user may input data indicating whether a reference was cited in a rejection in an office action the type of rejection in which the reference was cited and the like. Additionally in embodiments descriptive data can be entered automatically from a reference such as by utilizing output from a document parser a document management system and the like.

In embodiments the reference type indicator can include an input field for entering a particular reference type. In embodiments as shown for example in the input field can include a drop down menu that includes a list of selectable options e.g. US Patent US Publication Foreign Patent Document and Non Patent Literature Document from which a user can select the reference type corresponding to the reference to be added. Upon receiving a selection of a reference type the interaction region can be dynamically configured e.g. by a service hosted by an interaction server depicted in to display input fields corresponding to descriptive data appropriate for the reference type. For example if the US Patent reference type is selected the input fields presented may include a field for the patent number the issue date and the like.

In the illustrated embodiment the US PUBLICATION reference type has been selected and in response input fields corresponding to descriptive data appropriate for a published U.S. patent application are displayed including a title field not shown as it is obscured by the drop down menu a publication number field a publication date field an application number field a filing date field a priority date field an inventor field and a kind code field . The illustrated add references interface also includes a reference file field .

The reference filed field can be used to input a location corresponding to the reference e.g. an electronic copy of the reference . For example if the reference being added is stored on a local drive the address of the storage location e.g. c MyDocuments Test IDS matter references Methods to the madness.pdf can be entered in the reference file input field . Additionally in embodiments the reference file field can be populated with an address corresponding to a location on a DM system database external website or the like. In embodiments the interaction region includes a browse button that can be selected to open a browsing window to facilitate locating the reference. References can be stored for example locally on a shared database in a document management DM system or the like. By providing the address of the reference the interaction server can use the address to access the reference for presenting the reference to a user including the reference in an IDS filing package or the like. In embodiments various input fields of the interaction region can be automatically populated by the interaction server upon determining based on information entered into one or more of the other input fields that the reference has already been entered into the system. In embodiments information entered into key input fields e.g. input fields that are associated with a key field in a database can be checked against a database to determine whether a reference corresponding to the key value has already been entered. In embodiments upon detecting that a reference has already been entered an error message can be presented. After providing the appropriate descriptive data associated with the new reference the user can select an UPDATE button to submit the information to the interaction server which stores the descriptive information and associates the reference with the identified matter.

In embodiments each of the input fields in an add references interface may have a drop down menu or other mechanism for listing selectable options that can allow a user to select the desired information to be added. Additionally in embodiments a user may add a reference to a matter by searching for the reference within the system whereby if the reference is found the user may not need to input descriptive data using an add references interface but can simply command the interaction server to associate the found reference with a particular matter matters clan clans or the like. depicts an illustrative search interface for searching for matters references or the like. For example a user may utilize the search interface to search a references database for references to add to a matter. In embodiments the search interface provides the ability to search for references save search criteria export search results in various formats and associate references from search results with a matter.

As shown in the search interface includes a matter input field for receiving a matter identifier e.g. a matter number a search button for initiating a search for a particular matter a CLEAR MATTER button for clearing the matter input field a matter indicator and an attorney indicator . In embodiments a user can search for references by utilizing search text input fields and . For example a user can enter a matter number in the matter input field to search for a reference that may already be associated with a matter. Additionally the user may perform a search for a matter by activating the search button . In embodiments activation of the search button can cause a browsing window to be presented to the user can automatically run a search based on a portion of a matter number entered into the matter input field or the like. References can also be searched outside of the context of a particular matter by leaving the matter input field blank.

To search for a reference a user can enter a search parameter in the parameter field . A search parameter can include any type of location context or the like associated with searching for a matter. In the illustrated embodiment the parameter field can have an associated drop down menu that presents a list of selectable options and corresponding to various search parameters. For example in the selectable options include options for searching for keywords in a reference title searching for matching numbers in a patent number corresponding to a reference searching for matching numbers in a publication number corresponding to a reference searching for references having a particular country code and searching for keywords within the text of a non patent literature reference . In embodiments any number of different parameters can be presented for selection by a user. Additionally the user may wish to search generally for matching information by leaving the parameter field blank or in embodiments selecting NONE as a parameter .

In embodiments a search for a reference can be performed by entering information into any number of search text input fields such as for example a title field a text field or the like. Upon entering the desired search criteria the user can activate a SEARCH button to initiate the search. Search results can be displayed in a results region . If the search fails to yield any results a notification that no results were returned can be displayed in the results region . The results region can in embodiments include summary information regarding the results obtained the duration of the search session or any other information associated with the search. Upon receiving a set of search results the user can select a displayed result to cause information about the reference to be presented. In embodiments the presented information can include a selectable representation of the reference such that selection of the representation causes the reference itself to be presented to the user e.g. in PDF format . Embodiments of the search interface include a CLEAR SEARCH button for clearing the search text input fields and and or the search results from the results region so that a new search can be performed. Additionally the search interface can include functionality for associating a reference e.g. returned in a set of search results with a particular matter clan or the like.

As shown in the illustrated view matter interface includes a matter description region and a reference region . The matter description region includes a number of informational fields that present information associated with the particular matter of interest. In embodiments a matter can be selected by entering the matter number in a matter input field or by searching for a matter using a search button which may be similar to search buttons described above with reference to other interfaces. In embodiments upon selection of a particular matter the selected matter e.g. active matter can be indicated by an active matter indicator and various information fields within the matter description region can be automatically populated by the interaction server. In embodiments the interaction server may retrieve the information from a database e.g. database from a docketing system e.g. docketing system or the like.

Additionally as shown in the view matter interface includes an IDS version indicator which indicates which version of an IDS is currently being constructed. For example in embodiments if the IDS version indicator indicates v1 then there has not been an IDS filing package filed with respect to the active matter and thus the next IDS filing package that is generated will be the first IDS filing package for the matter and will be designated as v1. On the other hand if the IDS version indicator indicates v2 for example there has been one IDS filing package filed previously with respect to the active matter e.g. IDS v1 and the next IDS filing package to be generated will be designated as v2. This functionality not only provides the user with information regarding whether IDS filing packages have been filed in the past and how many but also provides a labeling convention so that the user can access previous IDSs associated with the active matter by utilizing a history function associated with the tool. Additionally corresponding database attributes can be used by the interaction server to ensure that when the interaction server generates an IDS filing package e.g. creates a completed IDS form and gathers cited references the interaction server will not cite references that have already been included in a previously filed IDS filing package.

The illustrative view matter interface also includes a PUSH button that facilitates pushing references to other matters e.g. causing a selected reference to be associated with additional matters within the clan a GENERATE IDS button that when activated causes a generate command to be communicated to the interaction server for generating an IDS filing package a SWITCH TO SEARCH button that when activated causes a search interface e.g. search interface depicted in to be presented a VIEW FAMILY button that when activated causes information associated with a family corresponding to the selected matter to be presented a VIEW CLANS button that when activated causes presentation of a listing of clans with which the selected matter is associated a REFRESH button that when activated causes the list of references in the reference region to be refreshed e.g. if multiple users are accessing the same matter at the same time and making changes regarding the references that are associated thereto the REFRESH button can be activated to refresh the interface so that the most current associations are presented and a selectable option for displaying removed references that when selected causes representations of references that have been removed from the selected matter e.g. references that have been disassociated with the matter to be displayed in the reference region .

The reference region includes representations of references that are associated with the matter. In embodiments the representations can be selectable such that selection of a representation causes the reference to be displayed to the user. In the illustrated embodiments a representation includes a reference type indicator a status indicator an origin indicator a key field an application number indicator a country indicator a priority date indicator and a title indicator . In embodiments the status indicator indicates the status of the reference with respect to the selected matter e.g. pending filed removed etc. . In embodiments the origin indicator indicates the origin of the reference with respect to the matter. In embodiments the origin of a reference refers to the manner in which the reference came to be associated with the matter. For example the reference can be directly associated with a matter such as by adding the reference to the matter through an add references interface see e.g. in which case the origin indicator can indicate that the reference was directly associated with the matter e.g. DIRECT . In addition a reference can be indirectly associated with a matter by utilizing a push functionality described below in which case the origin indicator can indicate that the reference was pushed e.g. PUSHED . In embodiments the origin indicator can indicate the matter from which a reference was pushed as well. According to embodiments when an IDS filing package has been approved for filing the references cited in the IDS form can be automatically pushed to each other matter associated with the clan. In that case the origin indicator can indicate that the reference was automatically associated by virtue of having been included in an approved IDS filing package for a matter in the same clan e.g. IDS . In embodiments the origin indicator may indicate that a reference had been added to the matter as a result of having been cited by a patent examiner in an office action e.g. CITED . Any other number of different types of originating information can be indicated by the origin indicator in accordance with embodiments of the invention such as for example information indicating that the reference was cited in an international search report a foreign office action a reexamination request or the like.

In embodiments the key field is used to display a key value associated with the reference. For example in embodiments the key value can be a key value used to uniquely identify the reference in a database. In the illustrated embodiment the key value is a string of characters that identify the reference. For example the key value can be a patent number publication number document number a hash a randomly generated character string or the like. In the illustrated embodiments the application number indicator is used to display the application number of the reference if the reference is a patent application or granted patent the country indicator is used to indicate a country code associated with the reference e.g. a code identifying the country in which the reference originated was first published was filed etc. the priority date indicator is used to indicate the priority date associated with a reference that is a patent or published patent application and the title indicator is used to indicate the title of the reference. In embodiments any number of different or additional data fields can be included within the representation of a reference. In some embodiments the data fields to be displayed are automatically selected based on the type of reference.

As introduced above references can be pushed to other matters via a view matter interface. As shown in in embodiments each representation of a reference includes a selectable region e.g. check box . To associate a reference with another matter a user can select the reference by selecting e.g. checking the selectable region and then activating the PUSH button . In embodiments activation of the PUSH button causes each selected reference to be associated with each other matter within the same clan. In embodiments the view matter interface can include mechanisms for selecting particular matters with which to associate a pushed reference. Additionally in embodiments pushing a reference can cause the reference to be associated with all of the matters in all of the clans with which the current matter is associated. In embodiments when a reference is associated with a matter e.g. directly as a result of being pushed automatically in response to having been included in an approved IDS for a matter in the same clan or the like users can be notified that the reference has been associated with the matter e.g. is now pending . In embodiments notifications can be presented to users through a dashboard interface communicated through email or the like.

Additionally as introduced above users can remove disassociate references from a matter via a view matter interface . To remove a reference a user can activate a REMOVE button corresponding to the representation of the reference. In embodiments the view matter interface may include a single REMOVE button and the user can remove one or more references by selecting the references e.g. by selecting a selectable region associated with the references and then activating the REMOVE button . In embodiments activating the REMOVE button causes the interaction server to receive a remove command in response to which the interaction server disassociates the reference from the matter. In embodiments when a reference is removed from a matter the representation of the reference will be removed from the reference region unless the DISPLAY REMOVED REFERENCES option is selected. Any number of mechanisms can be employed to differentiate removed references from associated references such as for example indicating the removed status in the status indicator or displaying the representation of the removed reference in a different color resolution or the like.

Because removing a reference from a matter may result in the removed reference not being included in an IDS filing package it can be desirable to have a record of the reason for which a reference has been removed from a matter and thus for example a reason for why the reference was not disclosed to a particular patent office . Accordingly in embodiments when a user submits a remove command to the interaction server e.g. by activating a REMOVE button the user may be presented with a set of selectable options corresponding to reasons for removing the reference. depicts an illustrative dialog box displayed over a view matter interface that includes selectable options corresponding to reasons for removing a reference. As shown in the dialog box includes a first radio button corresponding to a first reason CUMULATIVE NOT MATERIAL and a second radio button corresponding to a second reason CLERICAL ERROR . In embodiments any number of different or additional reasons can be included in the dialog box . Additionally in embodiments the options can be selectable hyperlinks checkboxes or any other mechanism for allowing a user to select between a number of reasons for removing a reference for manually entering reasons or elaborations on selected reasons or the like. In embodiments the user can select one or more of the options. In other embodiments the reasons can be presented as a part of the view matter interface rather than in a separate dialog box . Additionally embodiments include a mechanism for manually entering a reason such as via an annotation to the reference to allow for customized reasons to be associated with the removed references.

Utilizing the dialog box depicted in for example the user may select one or more of the options and and activate the OK button . The interaction server can associate the selected reason or reasons with the removed matter e.g. by associating an attribute with the reference in a database . If the user decides not to remove the selected reference the user can simply close the dialog box by activating the close button . Additionally once a reference has been removed it may be re associated with the matter. For example in embodiments representations of removed references that are displayed in the reference region can include an ADD button not shown the activation of which may cause the reference to be associated with the matter.

With continued reference to a view matter interface can also be used to generate an IDS filing package. A user can select a matter using the matter input field and or search button . Upon selection of the matter all of the pending references e.g. references that are associated with the matter but have not yet been included in an approved IDS filing package can be displayed in the reference region . In other embodiments all of the references associated with a matter can be displayed and those that have not yet been included in an approved IDS filing package can be identified with an indication of that fact. For example in embodiments the status indicator can reflect PENDING the representations of pending references can be displayed differently than references that have been included in an approved IDS filing package or the like. In embodiments the tool can automatically determine which references do or do not need to be cited in a next IDS such as for example by determining from information in the database whether a reference has already been cited in a previous IDS whether a reference has been cited in a parent application whether a reference has been cited in a corresponding foreign application or the like. In embodiments the user can view individual references by selecting the corresponding representations and when the user is satisfied that the list of pending references is complete the user can activate the GENERATE IDS button . Activation of the GENERATE IDS button causes a generate command to be communicated to the interaction server.

Upon receiving the generate command the interaction server automatically populates input fields of an IDS form with descriptive data associated with each of the pending references to create a completed IDS form. The interaction server associates the completed IDS form with the cited references to create an IDS filing package. In embodiments upon generating the IDS filing package a confirmation message illustrated in can be provided to indicate that the IDS filing package has been generated. In embodiments the confirmation message may include an OK button that a user can activate to confirm receipt of the confirmation message . According to embodiments upon generating the IDS filing package the interaction server can notify various users e.g. attorneys assigned to the matter filing specialists docketing personnel etc. that the IDS filing package has been generated and is ready for review e.g. by a responsible attorney . For example as depicted in such a notification may appear as a notification or as an IDS FILING IN PROCESS. In embodiments upon generating the IDS filing package the appearance of the view matter interface can change and or the functionalities of the interface can be partially or completely locked until the IDS filing package is either approved or denied. For example in embodiments the view matter interface may be grayed out and a red notification may be displayed to indicate that the matter has an IDS filing package pending.

When an IDS filing package has been generated it may be reviewed by a reviewing user e.g. a responsible attorney . illustrates an example of a notifications interface that can be accessed for example by activating the NOTIFICATIONS button on the dashboard interface . As shown in the notifications interface can include any number of notifications including a notification of an IDS filing package that is ready to review. The notification can include any number of different types of information such as for example the type of notification an indication of the sender of the notification e.g. a user that performed actions that resulted in the notification an indication of the matter to which the notification is related and the like. In embodiments the notification may also include a DELETE button that can be activated to delete the notification .

In embodiments the notification can be selectable. Upon selection of the notification an IDS review interface can be presented to the reviewing user. The IDS review interface can be presented as a pop up dialog box an interaction region within the notifications interface a separate interface or the like. As shown in the IDS review interface includes a sender indicator that identifies a sending user a recipient indicator that identifies a receiving user e.g. an attorney that is responsible for reviewing the IDS a supervisor indicator that identifies a user on whose behalf the IDS filing package was generated a date indicator that indicates the date and in embodiments time that the notification was sent e.g. generated and a matter indicator that indicates the corresponding matter. The illustrated IDS review interface also includes a listing of documents that are associated with the IDS filing package. For example as shown in the listing includes a representation of the completed IDS form IDS DOCUMENT and a representation of each of the associated references. The listing depicted in includes for each representation a document type indicator an identifier e.g. title key value etc. and a selectable representation that when selected by the user causes the corresponding document to be displayed. In this manner the user can review the listing as well as the individual documents associated with the IDS filing package. In embodiments the configuration of the IDS review interface can be varied in any number of ways from the depiction of .

In the illustrated embodiments after reviewing the listing of documents and or one or more of the corresponding documents the reviewing user can either approve or deny the IDS filing package by selecting one of two selectable options APPROVE and DENY . In embodiments any number of other options may be provided for selection. Upon selecting the approve option the selection is communicated to the interaction server which in response to receiving the selection of the approve option can notify a filing user that the IDS filing package is ready to be filed. This notification can be presented in a dashboard interface an email message or the like. In embodiments a filing user can be a user that is designated for filing IDSs with the appropriate patent office. Depending upon the particular implementation a filing user can be for example an administrative specialist tasked with filing IDSs a responsible attorney an administrative assistant or the like. Additionally in embodiments a notification sent to a filing user can include a selectable option for downloading the IDS filing package such that upon receiving a user selection of that option the interaction server causes the completed IDS form and each of the cited references to be saved to the user s computing device to a location on a document management system or the like. Additionally upon receiving a selection of the deny option the interaction server can cancel the IDS generation and return all of the references to a pending status so that the process of generating the IDS filing package can be started again. Furthermore in embodiments upon receiving a selection of the approve option the interaction server can automatically push each of the cited references to each of the matters in the same clan or clans as the matter to which the IDS corresponds.

As depicted in an interaction server e.g. interaction server depicted in receives a generate command block which for example can be communicated to the interaction server in response to a user activating a generate button on a view matter interface e.g. view matter interface depicted in . In other embodiments the interaction server can receive a generate command via an email message or other type of communication. In response to receiving the generate command the interaction server automatically creates a completed IDS form for the first matter block . According to embodiments the interaction server completes the IDS form by populating a number of input fields of an information disclosure statement IDS form. The IDS form can include an authorized fillable form provided by a patent office a letter e.g. for reporting references to a foreign patent office a foreign associate etc. or any other type of document that can be used to disclose references related to a patent application. In embodiments one or more of the input fields is populated with descriptive data corresponding to the first reference. Similarly other input fields can be populated with descriptive data corresponding to any other reference that is to be cited in the IDS form. In embodiments application data e.g. data corresponding to the patent application with respect to which the IDS form is to be filed can be automatically populated by the interaction server such as for example by retrieving such information from a docketing system database or the like. In the illustrated embodiment the interaction server automatically generates in response to receiving the generate command an IDS filing package block which includes the completed IDS form and the first reference and any additional references disclosed in the completed IDS form .

In embodiments of the method the interaction server notifies a reviewing user e.g. an attorney of the pending IDS filing package block . The notification can be presented to the reviewing user on a dashboard interface e.g. dashboard interface depicted in sent to a reviewing user via email some other messaging technology a combination of these or the like. In embodiments other users may also be notified of the pending IDS filing package. According to the illustrative method depicted in an IDS review interface is presented to a reviewing user block . For example a reviewing user can select the notification in embodiments in which the notification is presented as a selectable item to cause an IDS review interface to be presented e.g. review interface depicted in the reviewing user can navigate to the IDS review interface or the like.

In embodiments the IDS review interface can include a listing of the documents associated with the IDS filing package. The listing can include for example representation of the completed IDS form and a representation of the first reference. In embodiments these representations are selectable such that selection of the representation of the completed IDS form causes the completed IDS form to be displayed and selection of the representation of the first reference causes the first reference to be displayed. In this manner a reviewing user can review the listing of documents the completed IDS form and the references. Additionally in embodiments the displayed completed IDS form includes a signature input field such that upon determining that the completed IDS form is satisfactory a reviewing user can add an electronic signature to the completed IDS form before approving the IDS. In embodiments a signature e.g. an electronic signature can be added to the completed IDS form after the IDS filing package is downloaded onto a filing user s computing device.

In embodiments the IDS review interface includes a set of selectable options such as an approve option and a deny option. If a reviewing user selects the deny option the IDS can be canceled. According to embodiments of the method depicted in the interaction server receives an approval from the reviewing user block . Additionally in embodiments upon receiving the approval a filing user is notified that the IDS filing package is ready to be filed block . The notification can be presented to the filing user on a dashboard interface e.g. dashboard interface depicted in sent to the filing user via email or some other messaging technology or a combination of these. In embodiments other users may also be notified that the IDS filing package is ready to be filed.

As indicated in the interaction server receives a download request from a filing user block and in response to receiving the download request the interaction server provides a copy of the IDS filing package which can be saved on the filing user s computing device block . In embodiments the download request can be communicated to the interaction server in response to a filing user selecting a selectable option for downloading the IDS filing package. The selectable option can be provided for example in a notification that a filing user receives in a separate email in a drop down menu or the like.

In embodiments the interaction server automatically associates an indication with the first reference that the IDS filing package has been approved. As a result when the interaction server presents a view matter interface corresponding to the first matter the view matter interface can include an indication that the first reference has been included in the IDS filing package. In embodiments the interaction server also automatically associates the references disclosed in the IDS filing package with all of the other matters associated with the clan block . As a result when the interaction server presents a view matter interface corresponding to a second matter of the same clan for example the view matter interface can include an indication that the first reference is pending with respect to the second matter e.g. has not been included in an IDS filing package associated with the second matter but is associated with the second matter . Additionally the interaction server notifies various users that the references are now pending with respect to the second matter and any other matter within the clan block .
