title: Managing application template artifacts in a networked computing environment
abstract: Embodiments of the present invention provide an approach for managing application template artifacts throughout an application's lifecycle in a networked computing environment (e.g., a cloud computing environment). In a typical embodiment, a workload template is assigned to each phase of a set of successive phases of the application's lifecycle. Each template typically refers to a template in a preceding phase of the lifecycle. Moreover, the templates may contain pointers to artifacts used in the phases assigned thereto. Any changes occurring in the artifacts/phases are propagated to the corresponding templates so as to automatically manage application lifecycle operations.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to application lifecycle management. Specifically embodiments of the present invention relate to the management of application template artifacts throughout an application lifecycle in a networked computing environment e.g. a cloud computing environment .

The networked computing environment e.g. cloud computing environment is an enhancement to the predecessor grid environment whereby multiple grids and other computation resources may be further enhanced by one or more additional abstraction layers e.g. a cloud layer thus making disparate devices appear to an end consumer as a single pool of seamless resources. These resources may include such things as physical or logical computing engines servers and devices device memory and storage devices among others.

Cloud environments may apply an additional level of complexity as these environments bring together different stages of a software development lifecycle under a management system. Under such a configuration each stage of the development lifecycle may have an impact on another stage. For example a function test that generates new information may influence or have an impact on previous and or future development stages that require a potential update across the lifecycle of the application. Challenges may exist however in accurately or efficiently managing such dependencies.

In general embodiments of the present invention provide an approach for managing application template artifacts throughout an application s lifecycle in a networked computing environment e.g. a cloud computing environment . In a typical embodiment a workload template is assigned to each phase of a set of successive phases of the application s lifecycle.

As indicated above embodiments of the present invention provide an approach for managing application template artifacts throughout an application s lifecycle in a networked computing environment e.g. a cloud computing environment . In a typical embodiment a workload template is assigned to each phase of a set of successive phases of the application s lifecycle. Each template typically refers to a template in a preceding phase of the lifecycle. Moreover the templates may contain pointers to artifacts used in the phases assigned thereto. Any changes occurring in the artifacts phases are propagated to the corresponding templates so as to automatically manage application lifecycle operations.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description of cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or datacenter .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active consumer accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based email . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited consumer specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds .

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

Referring now to a schematic of an example of a cloud computing node is shown. Cloud computing node is only one example of a suitable cloud computing node and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the invention described herein. Regardless cloud computing node is capable of being implemented and or performing any of the functionality set forth hereinabove.

In cloud computing node there is a computer system server which is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems environments and or configurations that may be suitable for use with computer system server include but are not limited to personal computer systems server computer systems thin clients thick clients hand held or laptop devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor based systems set top boxes programmable consumer electronics network PCs minicomputer systems mainframe computer systems and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices and the like.

Computer system server may be described in the general context of computer system executable instructions such as program modules being executed by a computer system. Generally program modules may include routines programs objects components logic data structures and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system server may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.

As shown in computer system server in cloud computing node is shown in the form of a general purpose computing device. The components of computer system server may include but are not limited to one or more processors or processing units a system memory and a bus that couples various system components including system memory to processor .

Bus represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus an accelerated graphics port and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example and not limitation such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture ISA bus Micro Channel Architecture MCA bus Enhanced ISA EISA bus Video Electronics Standards Association VESA local bus and Peripheral Component Interconnects PCI bus.

Computer system server typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system server and it includes both volatile and non volatile media removable and non removable media.

System memory can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory such as random access memory RAM and or cache memory . Computer system server may further include other removable non removable volatile non volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only storage system can be provided for reading from and writing to a non removable non volatile magnetic media not shown and typically called a hard drive . Although not shown a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable non volatile magnetic disk e.g. a floppy disk and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable non volatile optical disk such as a CD ROM DVD ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances each can be connected to bus by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below memory may include at least one program product having a set e.g. at least one of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments of the invention.

The embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a computer readable signal medium which may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein e.g. in baseband or as part of a carrier wave . Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms including but not limited to electro magnetic optical or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate propagate or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system apparatus or device.

Program code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium including but not limited to wireless wireline optical fiber cable radio frequency RF etc. or any suitable combination of the foregoing.

Program utility having a set at least one of program modules may be stored in memory by way of example and not limitation as well as an operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data. Each of the operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data or some combination thereof may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules generally carry out the functions and or methodologies of embodiments of the invention as described herein.

Such communication can occur via I O interfaces . Still yet computer system server can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network LAN a general wide area network WAN and or a public network e.g. the Internet via network adapter . As depicted network adapter communicates with the other components of computer system server via bus . It should be understood that although not shown other hardware and or software components could be used in conjunction with computer system server . Examples include but are not limited to microcode device drivers redundant processing units external disk drive arrays RAID systems tape drives and data archival storage systems etc.

Referring now to illustrative cloud computing environment is depicted. As shown cloud computing environment comprises one or more cloud computing nodes with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers such as for example personal digital assistant PDA or cellular telephone A desktop computer B laptop computer C and or automobile computer system N may communicate. Nodes may communicate with one another. They may be grouped not shown physically or virtually in one or more networks such as private community public or hybrid clouds as described hereinabove or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment to offer infrastructure platforms and or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A N shown in are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes and cloud computing environment can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and or network addressable connection e.g. using a web browser .

It is understood that all functions of the present invention as described herein typically may be performed by the application lifecycle management functionality of management layer which can be tangibly embodied as modules of program code of program utility . However this need not be the case. Rather the functionality recited herein could be carried out implemented and or enabled by any of the layers shown in .

It is reiterated that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather the embodiments of the present invention are intended to be implemented with any type of networked computing environment now known or later developed.

Referring now to a system diagram describing the functionality discussed herein according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. It is understood that the teachings recited herein may be practiced within any type of networked computing environment e.g. a cloud computing environment . A computer system server which can be implemented as either a stand alone computer system or as a network computer system is shown in . In the event the teachings recited herein are practiced in a networked computing environment each client need not have an application lifecycle management engine engine . Rather engine could be loaded on a server or server capable device that communicates e.g. wirelessly with the clients to provide application lifecycle management therefor. Regardless as depicted engine is shown within computer system server . In general engine can be implemented as program utility on computer system of and can enable the functions recited herein. As further shown engine in one embodiment comprises a rules and or computational engine that processes a set at least one of rules logic and or provides application lifecycle management hereunder.

Along these lines engine may perform multiple functions similar to a general purpose computer. Specifically among other functions engine may among other things assign a set of templates A N to a set of successive phases stages e.g. a requirement phase a design phase a development phase a test phase a production phase etc. the set of successive phases corresponding to a lifecycle of an application and the set of templates A N being stored in a computer storage device A N provide a reference in at least one template of the set of templates A N assigned to a particular phase the reference referring to at least one previous template of the set of templates A N and the at least one previous template being assigned to a previous phase in the set of successive phases provide a set of pointers in the set of templates the set of pointers referring to a set of artifacts e.g. application requirements application tasks application source codes application test cases application defects application builds application compliance requirements etc. used in the set of successive phases identify a set of changes to the set of artifacts the set of changes occurring between individual phases of the set of successive phases propagate the set of changes to the set of templates generate a subsequent version of each of the set of templates to which the set of changes apply and or generate a notification corresponding to at least one of the set of changes.

The following section describes an illustrative example according to one embodiment of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments examples may be incorporated accommodated within the teachings recited herein. In any event the embodiments of the present invention manage cloud application template artifacts throughout an application s lifecycle through the use of cloud workload templates. Embodiments of the present invention further provide for validation of requirements throughout a cloud development lifecycle as well as a mechanism to correct update requirements as needed. In general each phase of the lifecycle of an application is assigned a workload template with each template having a substantially similar data structure model. Assume in this example that there are phases and assigned templates in a cycle of lifecycle of a particular application as follows 

Under the teachings recited herein changes to the phases e.g. the artifacts corresponding thereto are propagated to the assigned templates. Embodiments of the present invention provide for both horizontal propagation propagation between templates within a single cycle of a lifecycle as well as vertical propagation e.g. propagation between templates in successive cycles .

This approach manages and tracks changes in one particular cycle horizontally. Referring to an example of horizontal propagation is shown. As depicted comprises cycles A B each having phases A E with pointers shown as arrows in to particular templates assigned thereto. Under this embodiment changes are propagated between templates on an intra cycle basis. In general cycle B represents a further refinement from cycle A of a corresponding application.

As shown in cycle A changes are propagated from development phase C to design phase B and from design phase B to requirements phase A. As further depicted the changes resulted in an update from DesignTemplate V1 to DesignTemplate V1.1. However no changes were needed for the ReqTemplate V1. As shown in cycle B changes are propagated from test phase D to development phase C development phase C to design phase B from design phase B to requirements phase A. This series of propagations results in updates to the templates for the test phase D from TestTemplate V2 to TestTemplate V2.1 development phase C DevTemplate V2 to DevTemplate V2.1 and design phase B DesignTemplate V2 to DesignTemplate V2.1 . However no changes are needed to the template for requirements phase A e.g. ReqTenmplate V2 remained ReqTemplate V2 .

In the second cycle the tester may use a new version of a database to deploy and test the database. Once the database passes the test the TestTemplate V2 may modified with a new version of the database.

This approach manages and tracks changes across multiple cycles i.e. vertically . An example of this is shown in . As depicted shows cycles A C having phases A E. Cycles A B function internally as described above. So these details need not be repeated herein. As further shown in in cycle C changes are propagated from development phase B to design phase B and from design phase B to requirements phase A. This series of propagations results in updates to the templates for the development phase D DevTemplate V3 to DevTemplate V3.1 design phase B DesignTemplate V3 to DesignTemplate V3.1 . However no changes are needed to the template for requirements phase A e.g. ReqTemplate V3 remains ReqTemplate V3 . As further shown changes may be propagated on an inter cycle level. For example changes are propagated for development phase C between cycles C.

In the cycle C a developer may utilize a new implementation for a set of application programming interfaces APIs pointing to a different provider by modifying a workload template to point to a different provider. This may cause an error defect that is logged in cycles A B.

Apart from a horizontal notification this embodiment may generate a notification for DevTemplate V2.1 which in turn generates horizontal and vertical notification for DevTemplate V1.0 so that the error defect may be corrected and a patch or the like may be released.

This embodiment could also have a broadcast to all N nodes instead of just neighboring successive nodes. This may be implementing using the following function 

Referring now to a method flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. In step S a set of templates is assigned to a set of successive phases. As indicated above the set of successive phases correspond to a lifecycle of an application and the set of templates may be stored in a computer storage device. In step S a reference is provided in at least one template of the set of templates assigned to a particular phase. The reference typically refer to at least one previous template of the set of templates while the at least one previous template may be assigned to a previous phase in the set of successive phases. In step S a set of pointers is provided in the set of templates. The set of pointers typically refer to a set of artifacts used in the set of successive phases. In step S a set of changes to the set of artifacts is identified. The set of changes typically occur between individual phases of the set of successive phases. In step S the set of changes is propagated to the set of templates.
