This disclosure relates in general to the field of communications and more particularly to a system and a method for automated service profile placement in a network environment.

Power consumption accounts for a significant portion of a data center s operating costs. Mechanical and electrical costs associated with power consumption represent more than 80 of the capital cost of the data center. As the increasing number and functionalities of applications in data centers grow power consumption and consequent operating costs can also increase. For example one projection has estimated costs that can range from 12 500 per kW for low tier data centers running low power applications to upwards of 25 000 per kW for high tier data centers running high power applications. Over the past decade the costs associated with power consumption have increased 400 and these costs are expected to continue to rise. At the same time increasing complexity of applications may demand sophisticated ways to distribute applications over servers with varying operating and power characteristics.

An example method includes ranking a plurality of servers in a network environment according to power characteristics and selecting a server from the plurality of servers for placement of a service profile according to at least a priority specified in the service profile and a particular rank associated with one of the plurality of servers. The term selecting is inclusive of any type of assignment designation choosing provisioning creating a record to reflect an assignment or obligation etc. In more specific instances the ranking comprises identifying power groups into which the plurality of servers is partitioned identifying respective power group caps of the power groups determining respective power ranges and respective power supply multipliers of the plurality of servers calculating a score of each server in the plurality of servers and assigning ranks to the scores.

In yet other implementations a particular one of the servers is ranked higher than the other servers based on a higher power group cap of the particular server s associated power group the particular server s capability and a number of power supply units accessible by the particular server. In other scenarios for each respective power group into which the plurality of servers are partitioned the method can include identifying a respective power group cap and determining a sum of power ranges for substantially all servers in each of the respective power groups.

Turning to is a simplified block diagram illustrating a communication system for automated service profile placement in a network environment in accordance with one example embodiment. illustrates a communication system including a plurality of servers in a server pool . Servers may be provisioned in chassis and or racks . Servers may be managed by one or more management units called a unified computing system manager UCSM . UCSM may separate servers into discrete power groups e.g. power group A power group B power group C each of power groups being associated with respective power group caps . A service profile may be provisioned for configuring one or more of servers in communication system . Service profile may include a priority among other parameters and features. A placement module associated with UCSM may facilitate an automated service profile placement of service profile to a server e.g. server in a network .

According to embodiments of communication system service profile may be associated with one of servers for example server selected from server pool based on various considerations. Servers may be ranked according to various parameters such as server capability e.g. considering inventory power group caps and power supply capacity e.g. minimum required versus available power supply capacity . To select server servers may also be filtered based on constraints such as non power related constraints e.g. hardware constraints and high availability policies. Server may be associated with service profile based on a rank of server and priority among other parameters .

Certain terminologies are used with regard to the various embodiments of communication system . As used herein the term server encompasses computing resources that can perform computational tasks for clients over a network e.g. network . Servers can include server computers such as database servers file servers mail servers print servers and web servers personal computers e.g. blade PC that operate in conjunction with a client access device such as a thin client and workstations e.g. blade workstations that operate similarly to a blade PC with more computing power. Servers can include blade servers mounted on chassis . Blade servers are stripped down computers with modular designs optimized to minimize use of physical space and energy. Blade servers are configured to be mounted on chassis which provide multiple non computing services such as power distribution and cooling. Servers can also include rack servers mounted on racks . Rack servers are computers dedicated to be used as servers and configured to be installed in a rack framework. Racks may include multiple bays each designed to hold one server in place with screws or other fastening devices. A single rack e.g. rack can hold multiple servers stacked together e.g. one over the other consolidating network resources and minimizing floor space.

The term service profile can include a software definition of a server e.g. servers which may include its storage and network characteristics and configuration settings. When service profile is deployed to server UCSM may configure the server adapters fabric extenders fabric interconnects and other network elements to match the configuration settings specified in service profile . Service profile can leverage configuration policies created by server network and administrators. In some embodiments service profile may override server identity for example facilitating stateless computing in communication system . Service profile can take configuration settings from a resource pool preconfigured in UCSM .

As used herein the term network element is meant to encompass computers network appliances servers routers switches gateways bridges load balancers firewalls processors modules or any other suitable device component element or object operable to exchange information in a network environment. Moreover the network elements may include any suitable hardware software components modules interfaces or objects that facilitate the operations thereof. This may be inclusive of appropriate algorithms and communication protocols that allow for the effective exchange of data or information.

A power group can include a partition of servers that draw power from a common power distribution unit PDU . Each of power groups is unique and do not share servers a server cannot belong to more than one power group. In many embodiments a facility administrator may create power groups and populate them with servers based on various considerations such as power connectivity. Power group caps of a power group can include a maximum power consumption e.g. budget for that power group. The facility administrator may set power group caps for example according to breaker panel ratings for the data center. UCSM along with other network elements may ensure that power group caps are not exceeded irrespective of workload hardware changes e.g. server or power supply unit insertion or removal and other network changes. For example power group cap sets a total power consumption of servers in power group . Power group cap may be partitioned and distributed by UCSM to substantially all servers in power group .

As used herein the term priority of a server e.g. server indicates the importance of the server to the enterprise or a hierarchy. According to embodiments of communication system service profile may include a power control policy which may influence priority . The network administrator or other user can also set priority . Priority may also be influenced by computing storage and or network characteristics associated with service profile . Applications associated with service profile and their associated hardware requirements may further influence priority . For example an Oracle application which may demand greater availability and hardware resources may indicate a priority of 1 whereas a test server application which may not be a critical service may indicate a priority of 10. Additionally workload usage characteristics can influence priority . For example servers that are used more often may have a higher priority and vice versa. A higher priority can imply higher budget allocation e.g. in terms of power consumption for associated server and vice versa. In some embodiments priority may be according to a priority range which may be from 1 to 10 with 1 being the highest priority 10 being the lowest priority and 5 being a default priority. In some embodiments priority may specify a maximum power cap for associated server .

For purposes of illustrating the techniques of communication system it is important to understand the communications in a given system such as the system shown in . The following foundational information may be viewed as a basis from which the present disclosure may be properly explained. Such information is offered earnestly for purposes of explanation only and accordingly should not be construed in any way to limit the broad scope of the present disclosure and its potential applications.

Service profile SP association and disassociation are enablers to fast provisioning in a data center network environment. Placement of a service profile can include the process of choosing a suitable server from among multiple servers for association with the service profile where the choice is constrained by various considerations. Typical placement strategies have used central processing unit CPU memory storage and such other computing storage and or network characteristics as constraints in choosing the suitable server for the service profile. Other strategies may ignore the hardware and or network parameters in the service profile altogether and merely consider power as the sole constraint for choosing the suitable server. There are currently no strategies for selecting a server based on computing storage network and power characteristics.

As used herein the term power characteristics of a server can include power group caps applicable to the server the server s power consumption a number of power supply units PSUs accessible by the server an efficiency of power supply e.g. operating at capacity above at or below power needed for the server to function correctly a power range which can be a difference between maximum power consumption and minimum power needed e.g. a minimum of boot power and minimum capable power server hardware e.g. number of CPUs memory elements storage capacity etc. server capability e.g. number of applications that can be run on the server the server s processing speed the server s reliability etc. or other such features.

In a typical data center network the management software e.g. UCSM may reside in a fabric interconnect and control several chassis e.g. chassis through respective chassis management controllers CMCs . Each CMC may reside in a chassis and manage several blades through a baseband management controller BMC . The BMC may control a basic input output system BIOS in the respective blade. The facility administrator or other user may enter a power group cap e.g. 10 000 W for each power group through the management software. The management software may split up the power group cap for the different servers in the power group propagating all the way down to the BIOS of each server. If all the servers were identical the power allocation would have been uniform among the servers. However because servers may have different hardware installed therein power allocation can differ among the servers. For example a better equipped server e.g. with more powerful processors and larger memory may get a bigger budget of the power group cap.

In typical placement scenarios the network administrator or other user may manually or semi manually select a server association for a specific service profile. Such manual or semi manual placements can present a challenge because of the large number of servers from which to choose the suitable server. Some mechanisms for automatic selection operating with limited set of constraints may exist in the marketplace even if the limited functionality offered by such mechanisms are ignored such mechanisms may be outright greedy and choose the best server available without accounting for a possibility of higher priority service profiles being considered for placement in the future. Moreover with multiple UCSMs in a large scale deployment the automatic choice is further challenged.

Communication system is configured to address these issues and others in offering a system and a method for automated service profile placement in a network environment. Constraints such as power group caps server inventory server capabilities priority and PSU capacity may be considered for service profile placement. According to various embodiments placement module may rank servers according to power characteristics and choose server for placement of service profile according to at least priority and the server s calculated rank. Servers may be ranked by identifying their corresponding power groups identifying respective power group caps of power groups determining respective power ranges and respective power supply multipliers of servers calculating a score of each server and assigning ranks to the scores.

According to various embodiments the server choice may be implemented by identifying service profile e.g. from a group of several service profiles identifying server pool and partitioning server pool into priority sets according to respective ranks of server in server pool . Each priority set may be assigned a specific priority. The priority sets may be searched beginning with a priority set having priority specified in service profile until suitable server is found.

Embodiments of communication system may provide for scalable and automated placement of service profile in large data centers providing a simple and efficient mechanism that considers system state and power policies with incoming service profile priority to make an effective placement. Embodiments of communication system can additionally provide fully automated placement with almost zero administrator input e.g. manual placement irrespective of the data center scale with thousands of servers and millions of service profiles. Embodiments of communication system can also co exist with manual placement as the eligible server pool includes non associated servers e.g. servers that are not yet placed or configured according to a service profile .

Embodiments of communication system can enable scalable administration displacing manual error prone selection involving hundreds of calculations for each association. Moreover a dynamic data center could have high rate of associations and disassociations making incorrect placement highly probable with manual placement. By replacing or complementing manual placement embodiments of communication system can reduce errors and further enable quick and efficient service profile placement. Moreover communication system may be server agnostic implementing the selection and placement operations described herein irrespective of the server type e.g. blade server or rack server etc. . In some embodiments mechanisms for service profile placement as provided herein may not include floating point arithmetic e.g. using integer arithmetic instead leading to a decrease in the order of complexity of the mechanisms from n i.e. O n during initialization to n i.e. O n past initialization. Once past initialization mechanisms may provide for using a linked list type manager for additions modifications and deletions of server rankings possibly making it memory efficient.

Turning to the infrastructure of communication system the network topology can include any number of servers routers gateways and other nodes inter connected to form a large and complex network. A node may be any electronic device client server peer service application or other object capable of sending receiving or forwarding information over communications channels in a network. Elements of may be coupled to one another through one or more interfaces employing any suitable connection wired or wireless which provides a viable pathway for electronic communications. Additionally any one or more of these elements may be combined or removed from the architecture based on particular configuration needs. Communication system may include a configuration capable of TCP IP communications for the electronic transmission or reception of data packets in a network. Communication system may also operate in conjunction with a User Datagram Protocol Internet Protocol UDP IP or any other suitable protocol where appropriate and based on particular needs. In addition gateways routers switches and any other suitable nodes physical or virtual may be used to facilitate electronic communication between various nodes in the network.

Note that the numerical and letter designations assigned to the elements of do not connote any type of hierarchy the designations are arbitrary and have been used for purposes of teaching only. Such designations should not be construed in any way to limit their capabilities functionalities or applications in the potential environments that may benefit from the features of communication system . It should be understood that the communication system shown in is simplified for ease of illustration.

The example network environment may be configured over a physical infrastructure that may include one or more networks and further may be configured in any form including but not limited to local area networks LANs wireless local area networks WLANs virtual local area networks VLANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs virtual private networks VPNs Intranet Extranet any other appropriate architecture or system or any combination thereof that facilitates communications in a network. In some embodiments a communication link may represent any electronic link supporting a LAN environment such as for example cable Ethernet wireless technologies e.g. IEEE 802.11x ATM fiber optics etc. or any suitable combination thereof. In other embodiments communication links may represent a remote connection through any appropriate medium e.g. digital subscriber lines DSL telephone lines T1 lines T3 lines wireless satellite fiber optics cable Ethernet etc. or any combination thereof and or through any additional networks such as a wide area networks e.g. the Internet .

In various embodiments UCSM may be software that provides unified embedded management of software and hardware components in network across multiple servers . UCSM may manage communication system as a single entity through a graphical user interface GUI a command line interface CLI or an Extensible Markup Language XML Application Programming Interface API . UCSM may be embedded in one or more Fabric Interconnects using a clustered active standby configuration for high availability. UCSM may participate in server provisioning device discovery inventory configuration diagnostics monitoring fault detection auditing and statistics collection among other functions.

In some embodiments placement module may be an application embedded within UCSM . In other embodiments placement module may be a stand alone application accessible by UCSM . An application as used herein this Specification can be inclusive of an executable file comprising instructions that can be understood and processed on a computer and may further include library modules loaded during execution object files system files hardware logic software logic or any other executable modules.

Turning to is a simplified block diagram illustrating example details of placement module . Placement module may take as inputs service profile and information about servers in server pool and provide as output selected server for association with service profile . Placement module may include a processor a memory element a ranking module and a selection module . In various embodiments ranking module may rank servers according to various power characteristics such as power group caps power ranges and PSUs provided in each server. Servers may be assigned respective ranks based on these power characteristics. Placement module may perform operations described herein using at least processor and memory element .

In various embodiments ranking module may assign a higher rank to the servers in the group with a higher power group cap. Ranking module may assign a higher rank to a better equipped server. Ranking module may assign a higher rank when PSUs are sufficient to meet maximum demand. Ranking module may assign a low rank when PSUs may be insufficient at the time of ranking or in the future . Moreover ranking module may assign a lower rank to the servers that have a relatively lower capability compared to other servers in the same power group.

For example assume that G i is power group cap for power group . Assume that R i j is a power range of server in power group and S i is the sum of power ranges for servers in power group . As used herein the term power range of the server is the difference between the maximum power consumed by the server and minimum power needed by the power e.g. calculated as the minimum of boot power and minimum capable power . The value of the power range can approximate server capability. A better equipped server may have a higher power range.

Let M i j be a power supply multiplier PSM for server . PSM may be assigned a value of 0.5 when the server is operating at capacity below that needed for the chassis to function correctly. For example chassis may include server and include five PSUs to provide power to eight servers. Such a configuration may result in lower capacity when all eight servers are operational. PSM may be assigned a value of 1.0 when the server is operating at capacity needed for the chassis to function correctly. Turning back to the earlier example if chassis has eight PSUs to provide power to eight servers the configuration may result in PSM of 1.0. PSM may be assigned a value of 1.1 when the server is operating above capacity needed for chassis to function correctly. Turning back to the earlier example if chassis has ten PSUs to provide power to eight servers the configuration may operate above capacity.

In another example for chassis with a total of 4 PSUs when 2 PSUs are needed for correct functionality e.g. chassis operates two blade servers PSM may be 0.5 with 1 functional PSU PSM may be 1.0 with 2 functional PSUs PSM may be 1.1 with 3 or more PSUs. In yet another example for rack with a total of 2 PSUs when 1 PSU is needed for correct functionality e.g. rack supports a single server PSM may be 1.0 with 1 PSU PSM may be 1.1 with 2 PSUs.

According to various embodiments a score of server in power group may be calculated as R i j G i M i j S i . The score may be directly proportional to the power range R i j e.g. higher power range may indicate a better equipped server leading to a higher score the score may be directly proportional to power group cap e.g. higher power group cap indicates a higher power allocation for the power group and the score may be directly proportional to the PSM e.g. higher PSM indicates a better power capacity . In some embodiments the score may be stored in descending order of ranks e.g. rank 1 has higher score for example in a rank database . Ranks may be updated when servers are inserted removed associated or disassociated.

Placement module may include a selection module that selects server for associating with service profile . The association process involves first associating service profile to server pool . Server pool can be created by the network administrator or automatically for example through qualifiers. There may also be a default pool that contains all the servers managed by UCSM . Once server pool is identified a server selection algorithm may start automatically. First selection module looks at the non power related constraints e.g. memory requirements CPU speed etc. . Servers that do not meet the non power related constraints may be removed from the selection process.

Next a High Availability HA policy of service profile may be looked at. For example none of the service profiles in a HA cluster may be in the same power group. Servers that do not meet the HA policy of service profile e.g. servers are from the groups which have associated service profiles from the same HA cluster as service profile may be removed from the selection process. Subsequently priority sets may be created and populated with servers according to their respective ranks. The priority sets may be searched e.g. sequentially in a round robin manner or ascending manner or descending manner until suitable server is found. The selection process may maintain fair share for unequal priority distribution providing a compromise between two extremes i allocating higher ranked servers reserved for later higher priority service profiles and ii losing out to lower priority service profiles which can come in a swarm later and occupy the higher ranked servers.

The algorithm may not have information about incoming service profile priority distribution beforehand. For example there could be 1000 servers and 1 millions service profiles. It may be impossible to determine the next service profile presented to communication system for placement. Therefore a simple lookup would be insufficient to allocate a server with a particular rank to the service profile. Given the constraints of server and service profiles with seemingly arbitrary priorities selection module provides a reasonable quality of service for the higher priorities e.g. associating higher ranked servers with higher priority service profiles .

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations that may be associated with embodiments of communication system . Operations may include operation at which service profile may be identified for example from among several service profiles . In an example embodiment the network administrator may present service profile for placement. At server pool may be identified. In an example embodiment server pool may be presented by the network administrator for selecting a suitable server.

At placement module may read priority in service profile . At placement module may read server pool . For example placement module may determine the number and type of servers in server pool including their hardware characteristics and other information relevant to the selection process. At placement module may prune server pool based on high availability policies and non power related constraints. As used herein the term pruning can include removing non compliant servers that do not meet particular criteria. For example servers that do not meet high availability policies and non power related constraints may be pruned from server pool . At placement module may run a selection algorithm. At communication system may associate selected server to service profile .

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operational activities that may be associated with ranking servers in embodiments of communication system . Operations may start at for example when placement module is functional. At parameter i is initialized to 1. At placement module may determine power group cap for group i to be G i . At a sum of power ranges S i for group i is calculated. S i may be calculated once at system initialization and updated as needed when servers are added or removed from the group. At parameter j may be initialized to 1. At placement module may determine the power range for server j e.g. in group i to be R i j . At placement module may determine the power supply multiplier for server j to be M i j . At placement module may determine the score for server j to be R i j G i M i j S i . At a determination may be made whether the servers in group i are over. If not at parameter j may be advanced by 1 and the operations may loop back to to be repeated for next server 1 .

If servers in group i are over e.g. substantially all servers in group i have been scored a determination may be made at whether all power groups are over e.g. substantially all servers in server pool have been scored . If not parameter i may be advanced by 1 at and operations may loop back to to be repeated for next power group 1 . If power groups are over at servers may be ranked according to respective scores at . For example ranks may be assigned to the scores e.g. highest score may get a rank of 1 . In one example embodiment the ranking may be in reverse order of the scores with higher scores being given a lower rank value e.g. rank 1 given to a score of 100 rank 2 given to a score of 99 and so on . The operations may end at in this example scenario.

Turning to illustrates two example orderings A and B of servers having ranks into priority sets with varying priority values. In both examples A and B priority may be provided in a range from 1 to 10. Ten priority sets having priorities from 1 to 10 may be created. Myriad other ranges and number of priority sets may be used within the broad scope of the embodiments. The priority sets may be created by populating them with servers having a desired rank percentile e.g. with higher rank percentile indicating a higher powered higher capability server . A higher rank percentile may indicate a higher powered or higher capability server. In the FIGURE column represents the rank percentile and column represents the priority assigned to the corresponding priority set.

In example A priority set P i may be assigned a priority i and populated with servers having ranks in percentile 11 i 10 to 10 i 10. Thus servers ranked in the 90percentile may be placed into a priority set with priority 1 servers ranked in the 10percentile may be placed into another priority set with priority 10 and so on. In another example if there are 30 servers in server pool the top three 1 3 ranked servers may be placed in priority set P 1 having priority 1 the next three 4 6 ranked servers may be placed in priority set P 2 having priority 2 and so on until the last three 28 30 ranked servers may be placed in priority set P 10 with priority 10.

In example B priority set P 1 having priority 1 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 100th and 88th percentile priority set P 2 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 88th and 75th percentile priority set P 3 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 75th and 65th percentile priority set P 4 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 65th and 55th percentile priority set P 5 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 55th and 45th percentile priority set P 6 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 45th and 35th percentile priority set P 7 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 35th and 25th percentile priority set P 8 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 25th and 14th percentile priority set P 9 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 14th and 7th percentile and priority set P 10 may be populated with servers having ranks between the 7th and 0th percentile. Various other orderings and correspondence between rankings and priority may be used within the broad scope of the embodiments.

Turning to is a simplified block diagram illustrating an example sequential selection according to an embodiment of communication system for selecting suitable server to be associated with service profile . Servers may be partitioned into priority sets according to the embodiment. Although 10 priority sets are shown in the example any number of priority sets may be used within the broad scope of the embodiments. Each priority set may have associated priority 28 having value i. For example priority 28 of priority set may have a value of 1 priority 28 of priority set may have a value of 2 and so on.

Servers may be grouped into priority sets according to their rank percentile. For example servers with the highest 10 of scores may be populated in priority set servers with the next 10 of scores may be populated in priority set and so on. Servers with ranks from 11 i 10 to 10 i 10 may be populated into priority set . Any suitable grouping may be implemented within the broad scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment where lower priority value indicates a higher priority the higher ranked servers may be populated into priority sets with lower priority values. Thus servers with higher capability and more power budget may have a higher chance of being associated with service profiles having higher priority.

In various embodiments priority sets may be searched sequentially such as in a round robin manner. For example to select suitable server for service profile with priority having value i the iterative selection process may start with a first iteration at priority set . Starting at priority set may allocate a fair share for priority value i through reservation. If priority set does not have any servers populated therein other priority sets may be searched. In an example embodiment the selection may be sequential with a flexible selection pool . In the second iteration selection pool may include priority sets having priority i 1 and i 1 . If there are no servers in selection pool with priority sets having priority i 1 and i 1 selection pool may be expanded to include priority sets having priority i 2 and i 2 and so on like an expanding ring until suitable server is found. Such a sequential selection process may maintain fair share for scenarios with unequal priority distribution.

In various embodiments priority sets may be searched sequentially according to an ascending order. If priority has value 1 then selection pool may include only priority sets with values higher than 1 as there are no priority sets having values lower than 1 in the embodiment illustrated in the FIGURE. In various embodiments priority sets may be searched sequentially according to a descending order. If priority has value 10 then selection pool may include only priority sets with values lower than 10 as there are no priority sets having values higher than 10 in the embodiment illustrated in the FIGURE.

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations that may be associated with server selection in embodiments of communication system . Operations may include at which servers may be ranked according to a suitable ranking algorithm. At the ranks may be updated when server configuration is changed e.g. servers added to server pool servers removed from server pool servers associated with service profiles and thus no longer available for association servers dissociated from server profiles and thus available for association . At non power related constraints in service profile may be read. At a determination may be made whether any servers in server pool meet the non power related constraints. Non compliant servers e.g. servers that do not meet the non power related constraints may be removed from selection at . At relevant high availability policies may be read. At a determination may be made whether any servers are in power groups with associated service profiles from the same high availability cluster as the service profile . Again non compliant servers e.g. servers in the same high availability cluster may be removed from selection at .

At servers pruned after removing non compliant servers may be grouped into priority sets having the priority value of priority specified in service profile . At priority sets may be searched beginning with priority set having priority value i specified in priority of service profile . At a determination whether any server is present in priority set may be made. If not additional priority sets may be searched until suitable server is found. Suitable server may be thus selected at .

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations associated with selecting suitable server according to embodiments of communication system . Operations may start at for example when selection module is activated. At priority value may be set to i specified in priority of service profile . At a determination may be made whether any server is present in priority set . Any server in priority set may be chosen as suitable server at and the operations may end at . If priority set does not have any servers the priority value may be changed to increase selection pool so that additional priority sets are included in the selection process. For example parameter j may be set to i 1 or i 1 at and priority value may be set to j and operations may loop back to . The operations may continue with sequential searching of priority sets ordered according to ranks until suitable server is found.
