This is a nonprovisional application of Provisional Application No. 61 514 772 having the same title filed Aug. 3 2011.

In recent years it has been realized that the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum is of considerable scientific and technological interest which has lead to advances that include THz imaging see B.

Globus D. L. Woolard and J. L. Hesler Terahertz Sources and Detectors and Their Application to Biological Sensing Philosophical Transactions Royal Society A 362 365 377 2004 hereby incorporated by reference. However the THz spectrum still suffers from the often cited THz gap which refers to the lack of basic components available in this frequency range. See P. H. Siegel THz Technology 50 3 910 928 2002 hereby incorporated by reference. This deficiency has been reduced in part through the use of scalable artificial electromagnetic composites such as metamaterials and frequency selective surfaces. Multifunctional electromagnetic composites derive their response primarily from the geometry of unit cells arrayed in a periodic fashion. Through ingenious design these materials have been used to create a negative index of refraction see V. G. Veselago The Electrodynamics of Substances with Simultaneously Negative Values of and Sov.

At THz frequencies active electromagnetic composites have been developed including voltage controlled modulators and phase shifters and reconfigurable materials as reported in H. T. Chen et al. Active terahertz metamaterial devices Nature 444 597 2006 H. T. Chen et al. Experimental demonstration of frequency agile terahertz metamaterials Nature Photonics 2 295 2008 and H. Tao et al. Reconfigurable Terahertz Metamaterials Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 147401 2009 . All of these devices were created through precise design of metallo dielectric unit cells. The geometry of the metallic structure within the unit cell imbues the composite with macroscopic properties not found in its constituent components. As with atomic materials the point group symmetry of the unit cell maps onto the macroscopic properties. A prime example are unit cells the lack fourfold rotational symmetry which manifests as birefringence in the material response. This lack of symmetry has been previously exploited to make transmissive waveplates as referenced in A. C. Strikwerda Fan Hu Tao D. V. Pilon X. Zhang and R. D.

Rahm Strongly birefringent metamaterials as negative index terahertz wave plates Appl. Phys. Lett. 95 171104 2009 . However these and other typical THz components suffer high insertion loss which arises from Fresnel losses which can be substantial as typical materials at THz frequencies have large refractive indices. This can be remedied through the use of anti reflection AR coatings but in foregoing references A. C. Strikwerda Fan Hu Tao D. V. Pilon X. Zhang and R. D.

In P. Weiss et al. Strongly birefringent metamaterials as negative index terahertz wave plates Applied Physics Letters 95 171104 2009 hereby incorporated by reference there is reported an alternative approach for the design and fabrication of thin wave plates with high transmission in the terahertz regime. The wave plates are based on strongly birefringent cut wire pair metamaterials that exhibit refractive indices of opposite signs for orthogonal polarization components of an incident wave.

Referring now to a half waveplate rotates linearly polarized light by 90 degrees. A quarter waveplate converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light.

A preferred embodiment comprises a waveplate for operation in a reflection mode at a 45 angle of incidence thereby eliminating an avenue of potential powerloss. The reflection mode metamaterial waveplate can be static or dynamic. In the static case the electromagnetic response of the metamaterial does not change. In the dynamic case the electromagnetic response of the metamaterial can be altered by applying an external bias such as an electrical voltage or optical excitation beam.

A preferred embodiment comprises a reflection mode waveplate for operation in the terahertz region by shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave comprising a ground plane an array of polygonal unit cells the polygonal unit cells comprising a polymer positioned between the ground plane and the exterior of the array of polygonal patches.

Another preferred embodiment comprise a waveplate comprising an array of unit cells each unit cell comprising a ground layer a polymer material layer a layer of GaAs an n type GaAs thin layer grown on the GaAs layer and a split ring resonator fabricated on the n type GaAs thin layer grown on GaAs the split ring resonator having a gap such that when a reverse bias is applied between the ground layer and the split ring resonator the carriers in the gap are depleted and the split ring resonator resonance turns on.

Another preferred embodiment comprises a waveplate comprising an array of unit cells each unit cell comprising a ground layer a sapphire layer a silicon thin layer grown on the sapphire layer and a split ring resonator fabricated on the silicon thin layer grown on sapphire the split ring resonator having a gap such that when an optical pump beam is applied to the gap region photoexcited carriers in the gap short the gap and the split ring resonator resonance turns off.

Referring now to the unit cell pictured is of a static reflection mode half waveplate which is arrayed infinitely in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The rectangular patch is 119 m 194 m and the periodicity may be for example 195 m 234 m. The polyimide spacer thickness is 68 m and there is a continuous gold ground plane on the back side not shown in . All light colored gold structures may be approximately 200 nm thick.

Referring now to the unit cell pictured of an electrically modulated reflection mode quarter waveplate comprising an electrical split ring resonator SRR metamaterial ohmic contact fabricated on a 2 mm n type GaAs thin layer grown on GaAs using molecular beam epitaxy. The material is etched such that n type GaAs remains only in the gap of the SRR. Reverse bias between the gold ground plane Schottky contact and the SRR metamaterial ohmic contact depletes the carriers in the gap and turns on the SRR resonance. A layer of polyimide separates the SRR and the gold ground plane.

Referring now to the unit cell of an optically modulated reflection mode quarter waveplate pictured is an optically modulated reflection mode quarter waveplate. The electrical SRR is fabricated on silicon on sapphire. The material is etched so Si remains only in the gap . Photoexcitation by an optical beam generates electron hole pairs in the Si thereby shorting the gap and turning off the SRR resonance. The electrical split ring resonator SRR is fabricated on silicon on sapphire. The material is etched so Si remains only in the gap. Photoexcitation generates electron hole pairs in the Si thereby shorting the gap and turning off the SRR resonance.

In accordance with the principles of the present invention a preferred embodiment of the static reflection mode THz half and quarter waveplate for operation at a center frequency of 350 GHz was simulated fabricated and measured. While the design frequency was arbitrary the waveplate band of operation can be scaled over a wide frequency range by appropriate scaling the unit cell dimensions.

These results were then combined to quantify the polarization as Stokes parameters as shown in and D. Regarding the Stokes parameters see references A. C. Strikwerda Fan Hu Tao D. V. Pilon X.

The overall intensity of the reflected light Stokes parameter I not shown for brevity from the static reflection wave half waveplate was used to normalize the remaining parameters. In the band of interest 320 372 GHz To is 81 as indicated by the crossing throughput magnitudes at 0.90 . From 320 372 GHz over 99 of the reflected light has been rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the incident polarization and the other parameters are under 1 indicating near complete extinction of unwanted polarizations.

Referring now to the unit cell pictured of an optically modulated reflection mode quarter waveplate consists of an electrical SRR fabricated on silicon on sapphire. The material is etched so Si remains only in the gap. Photoexcitation generates electron hole pairs in the Si thereby shorting the gap and turning off the SRR resonance.

To validate the simulated results the static half and quarter reflection mode waveplates were fabricated and tested on a CW photomixing THz spectroscopy system operating in a heterodyne configuration. See A. Majewski R. Abreu and M. Wraback A High Resolution Terahertz Spectrometer for Chemical Detection Proc. SPIE 6549 65490B 2007 D01 10.1117 12.719485 hereby incorporated by reference. The spectrometer is continuously tunable between 0.09 and 1.2 THz with 1 MHz resolution.

The system emits a linearly polarized CW THz beam and has a polarization sensitive detector. In one testing setup as shown in the static reflection mode half waveplate was placed on a rotating sample holder with an incident beam at a 45 degree angle. Two configurations were measured one where the polarization sensitive detector was aligned parallel to the polarization of the emitter and one where the detector was orthogonal to the polarization of the emitter. The half waveplate was then illuminated by a 350 GHz CW beam and rotated in place while the detected signal amplitude was recorded as a function of angle. The results plotted against simulation are shown in and clearly demonstrate both the conversion and extinction of the incident polarization as a function of waveplate rotation. There are four maxima and minima as expected due to the rectangular nature of the unit cell and consistent with a diagonal Jones matrix for the half waveplate that is sandwiched between two rotation matrices to model waveplate rotation.

For the illustration of the static reflection mode half waveplate was rotated while being illuminated by 350 GHz CW radiation. As the fast slow axes of the waveplate align with the polarization a maximum in the Aligned configuration corresponds to a minimum in the Orthogonal configuration. Similarly the Orthogonal configuration results in a maximum when the incident polarization is at 45 degrees relative to the fast slow axes of the electromagnetic composite.

In a second testing setup as shown in the static reflection mode waveplate is fixed on a sample holder such that the fast slow axes of the electromagnetic composite is aligned at 45 degrees relative to the polarization of the incident THz beam. The waveplate is illuminated with a 350 GHz linearly polarized CW THz beam from a photomixer source at a 45 degree incidence angle. The reflected beam is sent through an analyzer into a polarization sensitive photomixer. The analyzer is mounted on a rotation stage. The reflected signal is detected as a function of the rotation angle of the analyzer. S polarized refers to light polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. P polarized refers to light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence.

The experimental results are illustrated in for the static reflection mode half waveplate and in for the static reflection mode quarter waveplate. The data is fit with modeling using Jones Matrix analysis detailed in G. D. Metcalfe M. Wraback A. C. Strikwerda K. Fan X. Zhang and R. D. Averitt Terahertz Polarimetry Based on Metamaterial Devices Vol. 8363 836300 2012 and D. Goldstein 2nd ed. Marcel Dekker New York 2003 . The waveplate is represented by a diagonal Jones matrix. The analyzer is represented by a separate diagonal Jones matrix which is sandwiched between two rotation matrices.

For the static reflection mode half waveplate the experimental data displayed in corresponds well with modeling based on Jones Matrix analysis black solid line . The fitting parameters are the relative phase shift between the TM and TE components and the ratio of the reflection amplitudes of the TM and TE amplitudes r r. The data fits well to 180 degrees and r r 1 indicating the polarization of the reflected beam is rotated relative to the incident beam by 90 degree i.e. the experimental data corresponds well with modeling based on Jones Matrix analysis black solid line with the phase shift 180 degrees and the ratio of reflection amplitudes r r 1 indicating the polarization of the reflected beam is rotated relative to the incident beam by 90 degrees.

For the static reflection mode quarter waveplate the experimental data displayed in fits well to modeling based on Jones Matrix analysis where the fit parameters are 115 degrees and r r 2.2. The fit results indicate that the polarization of the reflected beam is almost circularly polarized.

In summary functional static reflection mode THz half and quarter waveplates were designed that in comparison to previous transmission mode waveplates exhibit an increased intensity throughput efficiency. The throughput efficiency for the half waveplate was 80 for the reflection mode in comparison to 50 for the half waveplate in transmission mode. The static reflection mode half waveplate also simultaneously doubled the induced phase shift resulting in a functional half waveplate with a center frequency of 350 GHz. The static reflection mode quarter waveplate exhibits an increased intensity throughput efficiency of 95 in comparison to 50 for the transmission mode waveplate. The static reflection mode quarter waveplate also simultaneously induces a 90 degree relative phase shift resulting in a functional quarter waveplate with a center frequency of 350 GHz. More generally it is our belief that designing THz components in reflection will provide an avenue for lower loss THz components.

The designed and simulated dynamic reflection mode quarter waveplates show a high degree of polarization conversion. The waveplates can be externally modulated either electrically or optically.

Here THz half and quarter waveplates are presented for operation in reflection mode. Compared to previous work these reflection mode waveplates have a greatly increased efficiency while maintaining the high degree of polarization conversation and ease of fabrication. These structures consist of Au and polyimide and have the additional advantages of being compact flexible and easily fabricated over large areas using standard microfabrication processing. The waveplates were simulated using CST Microwave Studios and designed for operation at 0.350 THz with a 45 degree angle of incidence. Both of these structures achieved over 99 polarization conversion with a reflected intensity of 81 and 95 for the half and quarter waveplate respectively. These performance factors were calculated by extracting the Stokes Parameters from our simulation results. displays their broadband polarization conversion and the physical dimensions are displayed in . The experimental results are analyzed using Jones Matrix calculations to extract the induced phase shift and reflection coefficients of the waveplates. While these structures were designed for 0.350 THz this frequency is easily adjustable by appropriate scaling of the waveplate dimensions. Due to the ease of their scaling robust nature and incredible simplicity the preferred embodiment waveplates are an attractive choice for use in CW THz systems.

As used herein the terminology split ring resonator refers to split rings formed from a composite material used to produce a magnetic response in various metamaterials. The splits in the ring or rings enable the structure to support resonant wavelengths much larger than the size of the rings.
