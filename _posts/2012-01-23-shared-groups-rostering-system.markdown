This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 246 191 filed Oct. 6 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 103 729 now allowed which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 810 625 filed Mar. 19 2001 abandoned which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 189 973 filed Mar. 17 2000 all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference to their entireties.

The present invention relates generally to transferring data between subscribers of a communications system and more particularly to sharing information among members of a group.

Online service providers are constantly offering new services and upgrading existing services to enhance their subscribers online experience. Subscribers have on demand access to news weather financial sports and entertainment services as well as the ability to transmit electronic messages and to participate in online discussion groups. For example subscribers of online service providers such as America Online or CompuServe may view and retrieve information on a wide variety of topics from servers located throughout the world. A server may be maintained by the service provider or by a third party provider who makes information and services available through the worldwide network of computers that make up the online service.

America Online has provided subscribers with the ability to send and receive instant messages. Instant messages are private online conversations between two or more people who have subscribed to the instant messaging service and have installed the necessary software. Because such online conversations virtually take place in real time instant messaging can provide immediate access to desired information. Instant messaging is becoming a preferred means of communicating among online subscribers.

Subscribers may at times encounter more complexity than they would like which may lead to a frustrating experience online. Moreover some subscribers may at times feel isolated in the online community. This is especially likely to occur for inexperienced subscribers. For example it may be difficult to share information among members of a group such as for example a family. Tasks such as sharing an instant message buddy list updating a shared address book or updating a shared calendar may be time consuming tedious or intimidating to some subscribers.

In one general aspect information is shared among members of a group by storing information about all current members of the group receiving instructions from a group member inviting a prospective member to join the group sending an invitation to the prospective member receiving a response from the prospective member adding the prospective member to the group when the response is positive and providing automatically updated services to current group members.

Implementations may include sending the invitation by an e mail message an instant message or in an on line chat room. Implementations also may include receiving the response by an e mail message an instant message or in an on line chat room. The automatically updated services may include for example providing a list of current group members sharing information in an address book sharing information in a calendar providing an online forum for current group members to chat with other group members sending instant messages from a current group member to other current group members sharing data files among current group members sharing a buddy list among current group members and offering new services to current group members. The shared information may be updated based upon information entered by the current group members. In the shared address book the information shared may include for example a name an address either personal or business an email address an instant message user identifier a screen name and a telephone number. In the shared calendar the shared information may include for example a date an appointment an anniversary a birthday a holiday and an invitation for other current group members to attend an event. For the shared data files implementations may include sharing for example digital images such as photographs text files or multimedia files.

In another general aspect a communication system shares information among members of a group through a group administrator which processes information about current group members a group communicator that delivers and exchanges information with both current and prospective group members and a group information updater that provides automatically updated services to current group members.

Implementations may include for example a group administrator that has a group member profile server to update information about the group members and a database to store data about the group members. Implementations also may include for example a group communicator that has an instant message host complex and a login server to communicate with a client system and determine whether the client is authorized to access the instant message host complex. The instant message host complex may include an instant message server to send and receive data a domain server to provide supporting functions and a routing gateway.

A group communicator also may have an OSP host complex and login server to communicate with a client system and determine whether the client is authorized to access the OSP host complex. The OSP host complex may include an OSP server to send and receive data.

The group information updater may have a user interface to communicate and exchange data with group members receive updated information from the user interface and automatically provide updated services to group members. The user interface may reside for example on an instant message complex an OSP host complex or on the Internet.

In another general aspect a graphical user interface UI may be used to invite prospective members to join the group. The UI may include an invitation message the group name a list of current group members and a tool that allows the prospective member to respond to the invitation.

These and other general aspects may be implemented by an apparatus and or by a computer program stored on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may comprise a disc a client device a host device and or a propagated signal.

Examples of application programs include authoring applications e.g. word processing database programs spreadsheet programs or graphics programs capable of generating documents or other electronic content client applications e.g. AOL client CompuServe client AIM client AOL TV client or an ISP client capable of communicating with other computer users accessing various computer resources and viewing creating or otherwise manipulating electronic content and browser applications e.g. Netscape s Navigator or Microsoft s Internet Explorer capable of rendering standard Internet content.

The general purpose computer also includes a central processing unit CPU for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation the client controller includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage of the general purpose computer . In another implementation the client controller includes application programs externally stored in and performed by one or more device s external to the general purpose computer .

The general purpose computer typically includes a communication device for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver a set top box a communication card a satellite dish an antenna or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general purpose computer also may include a TV television tuner for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast satellite and or cable TV signals. As a result the client device can selectively and or simultaneously display network content received by communications device and television programming content received by the TV tuner .

The general purpose computer typically will include an input output interface for wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices include but are not limited to a mouse a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a keyboard a display monitor with or without a touch screen input a TV remote control for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers and a video input device .

Although illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone a PDA and a TV remote control as being peripheral with respect to the general purpose computer in another implementation such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general purpose computer and operate as the client device . For example the mobile phone or the PDA may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device by accessing the delivery network and communicating with the host system .

In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to the host systems and shown in respectively and illustrates one possible implementation of those systems.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . In general the host controller is capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host device includes a login server for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system and other elements of the host device . The host device also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP Online Service Provider host complex and IM Instant Messaging host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers the client system includes communication software such as for example an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber s interactions with the respective services and in particular may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.

Typically the OSP host complex supports different services such as email discussion groups chat news services and Internet access. The OSP host complex is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols i.e. standards formats conventions rules and structures to transfer data. The OSP host complex ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common underlying proprietary protocol.

In general the IM host complex is independent of the OSP host complex and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber s network or Internet access. Thus the IM host complex allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages regardless of whether they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex may support associated services such as administrative matters advertising directory services chat and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data the IM host complex employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.

The host device may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes such as the OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex with the IM host complex through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily when used to facilitate a link between complexes the OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance the OSP host complex and IM host complex generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway and or the IM host complex gateway .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link .

Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to the host systems and and illustrates one possible implementation of those systems. describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex . In general for purposes of communicating with an OSP host complex the delivery network is a telephone network.

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is capable of establishing a connection to the host system including the OSP host complex the IM host complex and or the Internet . In one implementation the client controller includes an OSP application for communicating with sewers in the OSP host complex using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller also may include applications such as an IM client application and or an Internet browser application for communicating with the IM host complex and the Internet .

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host system includes a login server capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems to various elements of the host system including an OSP host complex and an IM host complex .

The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more al host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

The OSP host complex supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex may be viewed as existing on the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example servers may be arranged in centralized or localized clusters in order to distribute servers and subscribers within the OSP host complex .

In the implementation of the OSP host complex includes a routing processor . In general the routing processor will examine an address field of a data request use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request and direct the data request to the appropriate destination. In a packet based implementation the client system may generate information requests convert the requests into data packets sequence the data packets perform error checking and other packet switching techniques and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system the routing processor may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . For example in the event that a data request from the client system can be satisfied locally the routing processor may direct the data request to a local server . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally the routing processor may direct the data request externally to the Internet or the IM host complex through the gateway .

The OSP host complex also includes a proxy server for directing data requests and or otherwise facilitating communication between the client system and the Internet . The proxy server may include an IP Internet Protocol tunnel for converting data from OSP protocol into standard Internet protocol and transmitting the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel also converts data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the converted data to the routing processor for delivery back to the client system .

The proxy server also may allow the client system to use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the OSP host complex and the Internet . For example the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system to generate a request in standard Internet protocol such as HTTP HyperText Transport Protocol . In a packet based implementation data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol such as for example UDP User Datagram Protocol and routed to the proxy server . The proxy server may include a L2TP Layer Two Tunneling Protocol tunnel capable of establishing a point to point protocol PPP session with the client system .

The proxy server also may act as a buffer between the client system and the Internet and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example the proxy server can check parental control settings of the client system and request and transmit content from the Internet according to the parental control settings. In addition the proxy server may include one or more caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches the proxy server may send the information to the client system from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link . Client system typically includes one or more client devices and one or more client controllers for controlling the client devices . Host system typically includes one or more host devices and one or more host controllers for controlling the host devices . The communications link may include communication pathways enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown the client system may access the Internet through the host system .

Examples of each element within the communication system of are broadly described above with respect to . In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to the host systems and shown in and illustrates one possible implementation of those systems. However describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex . In general for purposes of communicating with the IM host complex the delivery network is a telephone network.

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is capable of establishing a connection to the host system including the OSP host complex the IM host complex and or the Internet . In one implementation the client controller includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex utilizing exclusive IM protocols. The client controller also may include applications such as an OSP client application and or an Internet browser application for communicating with the OSP host complex and the Internet respectively.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host system includes a login server capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems to various elements of the host system including an OSP host complex and an IM host complex . The login server may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

To access the IM host complex to begin an instant messaging session the client system establishes a connection to the login server . The login server typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex the login server employs a hashing technique on the subscriber s screen name to identify a particular IM server for use during the subscriber s session. The login server provides the client system with the IP address of the particular IM server gives the client system an encrypted key i.e. a cookie and breaks the connection. The client system then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server through the communications link and obtains access to that IM server using the encrypted key. Typically the client system will be equipped with a Winsock API Application Programming Interface that enables the client system to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .

Once a connection to the IM server has been established the client system may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers may support associated services such as for example administrative matters directory services chat and interest groups. In general the purpose of the domain servers is to lighten the load placed on the IM server by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server and or the domain server a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers buddies are online exchange instant messages with particular subscribers participate in group chat rooms trade files such as pictures invitations or documents find other subscribers with similar interests get customized news and stock quotes and search the Web.

In the implementation of the IM server is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway facilitates the connection between the IM server and one or more alert multiplexors for example by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers to several alert multiplexors. In general an alert multiplexor maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.

Once the client system is connected to the alert multiplexor a subscriber can register for and or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system and the alert multiplexor is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server to identify the particular alert multiplexor to be used for the subscriber s session. Once the particular multiplexor has been identified the IM server provides the client system with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor and gives the client system an encrypted key i.e. a cookie . The client system then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor through the communication link and obtains access to the alert multiplexor using the encrypted key.

The alert multiplexor is connected to an alert gate that like the IM host complex gateway is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate is the interface between the IM host complex and the physical servers such as servers in the OSP host complex where state changes are occurring. In general the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However the alert multiplexor also may communicate with the OSP host complex through the IM gateway for example to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex with certain information gathered from the alert gate .

The alert gate can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate may include a piece of code alert receive code capable of interacting with another piece of code alert broadcast code on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general the alert receive code installed on the alert gate instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed the alert gate contacts the alert multiplexor which in turn informs the client system of the detected alert feed.

In the implementation of the IM host complex also includes a subscriber profile server connected to a database for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server may be used to enter retrieve edit manipulate or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation a subscriber s profile data include for example the subscriber s buddy list alert preferences designated stocks identified interests and geographic location. The subscriber may enter edit and or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system to interact with the subscriber profile server .

Because the subscriber s data are stored in the IM host complex the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex using new or a different client system . Accordingly when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex the IM server can instruct the subscriber profile server to retrieve the subscriber s profile data from the database and to provide for example the subscriber s buddy list to the IM server and the subscriber s alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link . Client system typically includes one or more client devices and one or more client controllers for controlling the client devices . Host system typically includes one or more host devices and one or more host controllers for controlling the host devices . The communication link may include one or more delivery networks . A network may be any known or described delivery network including but not limited to a telephone network and or the Internet.

The login server may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

In one implementation the host system includes one or more group administrators in communication with one or more group communicators . The group communicators are further in communication with one or more group information updaters . Each group may have dedicated servers maintained locally on a particular host complex or at a centralized location. As shown the group communicator and the group information updater exist on the OSP host complex and the group administrator exists on the IM host complex . Other configurations however may be used in alternative implementations. For example the functionality of the group administrator the group communicator and the group information updater may reside on a single server or be distributed among multiple servers.

The group communicator cooperates with the group administrator and the group information updater and is configured to deliver and exchange information with current and prospective members of the group. In particular the group communicator is configured to process invitations from current members of the group to prospective members. Any of the current group members as reflected in the group administrator s records may use the group communicator to initiate or receive messages from a current or a prospective group member. The group communicator may send and receive messages from current and prospective group members through an IM server the Internet and or other communications server e.g. e mail server chat sever OSP buddy server . Typically the group information updater will include a user interface configured to interact with client devices of group members and facilitate information exchange. The user interface may for example allow group members to select and input information e.g. new group screen names of invited members to the group communicator and allow entered information e.g. group membership screen names of group members to be extracted by the group communicator .

In one implementation the group communicator communicates with an IM server the Internet and or other communications server . The group communicator is configured to permit access to various groups and to route communications of group members to the correct servers for delivery to prospective members. The login sewer may assist the group communicator with authorizing access to the various groups.

The group administrator is configured to keep track of information about current group members and to provide automatically updated services to current group members. In one implementation the group administrator includes a group member profile sever configured to enter update retrieve store edit manipulate or otherwise process information about the current members of a group and a database for storing information associated with group members. The group administrator may be configured to gather and track information about the online status of and services provided to current group members. In one implementation the group administrator communicates with an IM server that monitors the online status and capabilities of group members. The group administrator also may for example communicate with the OSP Host Complex or the Internet to gather and track such information.

The group information updater cooperates with the group communicator and the group administrator and is configured to perform all necessary processing to keep the information about the current group members up to date. In one implementation the group information updater is configured to instruct the group administrator to update information associated with group members.

Referring to a current member a prospective member and a host interact according to a procedure to share information among members of a group. The current member and the prospective member are each associated with a user and typically have attributes comparable to those described above with respect to client devices and and or client controllers and . The host typically has attributes comparable to those described above with respect to host devices and and or host controllers and in host systems and . The host may be directly or indirectly interconnected to the client and the client through a known or described delivery network. The procedure may be implemented by any type of hardware software device computer computer system equipment component application code storage medium or propagated signal.

There may be several different levels and types of groups. Examples of groups include but are not limited to family friends co workers classmates teammates affiliates and the like. Subscribers may create and join several different groups. The group feature may be associated with and or provided by different host complexes e.g. Groups AOL Groups CompuServe and or different web pages e.g. Groups Netscape.com Groups CNN.com .

A group typically will be made up of a subset of the subscribers to the host but may include members who are not subscribers to the host . To participate in a group a subscriber must either create a new group and invite others to join or enter a group to which the subscriber has been invited. In one implementation when a subscriber creates a group the subscriber is considered the founder of the group. As the founder the subscriber has the ability to remove members and delete content. Any member can leave a group at any time after joining but only the founder of a group can delete a group. When a founder leaves the group the group must also be deleted. Alternatively any group member may be provided with the same capabilities as the founder including the ability to remove members delete content and delete the group.

The founder can designate other group members to manage the group as owners of the group. A group owner is allowed to change settings e.g. homepage group title or description for the entire group delete and edit group and other member s content invite prospective members change member owner status of any other member send administrative e mails as an owner and even remove troublesome members. Group owners are notified when there is an issue with member e mail. If there are repeated delivery difficulties or excessive unsolicited bulk mail an indication of possible mail list abuse a member may be temporarily suspended from participating in the group mail list. The group owner may opt to resume delivery remove the member from the group or resolve the issue later.

To create a group a subscriber enters attributes of the group to the host through a user interface displayed on a client device. The group attributes may include but are not limited to a unique group name a description of the group a time zone so that events are properly timed a group theme e.g. Family Friends Activity Group and a design style having a certain color schemes images that represent members. The subscriber also may create a personal profile and make it available to other group members. The personal profile may include information such as name e mail address mailing address phone numbers birthday which shows up automatically in an events area an image e.g. photo icon a home page and or other personal information e.g. quotes messages .

Once the subscriber has created the group the subscriber is considered the founder an owner and a member of the group. In one implementation described in more detail below any member of the group can extend an invitation to a prospective member. In other implementations however the ability to invite prospective members may be limited only to founders and or owners of the group.

Referring again to a current member sends to the host an instruction to invite at least one prospective member to join the group step . In one implementation the current member presents a user interface to a subscriber for inputting a screen name or e mail address associated with the prospective member . In another implementation the current member sends an invitation when the right button of a computer mouse is clicked while pointing to a screen name associated with a prospective member . The right click causes a menu of choices to appear. When an option from the menu to send an e mail message inviting the prospective member to join the group is selected the current member automatically generates the invitation.

The host receives the instruction to invite the prospective member step and in response sends an invitation to the prospective member to join the group step . The invitation may be sent as for example an e mail message an instant message a post in an online chat room or by other suitable communication. In one implementation the group communicator receives the instruction and sends the invitation through at least one of the IM server the Internet and or other communications server e.g. e mail server chat sever OSP buddy server .

The prospective member receives the invitation to join the group step and sends to the host a response to the invitation step . In one implementation the invitation includes a hyperlink to facilitate joining the group a personal welcoming message and or a list of current group members. When the hyper link contained in the invitation is clicked the prospective member sends an affirmative confirmation message indicating the prospective member s desire to join the group and links to the group web site. The response may be sent as for example an e mail message an instant message a post in an on line chat room or other suitable communication. The response may be affirmative indicating the prospective member s desire to join the group or the response may be negative indicating the prospective member s desire not to join the group. If no response is sent the lack of a response may be deemed to be a negative response after an appropriate length of time has passed. Alternatively the lack of a response may be deemed to be a positive response after an appropriate length of time has passed.

The host receives the response from the prospective member step and notifies the sender of the response step . In one implementation the group communicator receives and notes the response to the invitation from the prospective member . The group communicator then sends a notification to the current member based on the response. If the response from the prospective member is negative the group communicator informs the current member that the prospective member has declined the invitation. If on the other hand the response from the prospective member is affirmative i.e. the invitation is accepted the host adds the prospective member to the group step and provides automatically updated services to current members of the group step .

The automatically updated services provided to current members of the group by the host include but are not limited to providing a private group website a list of current group members a shared buddy list a shared address book shared member profiles a shared calendar a shared map a shared message board a private on line forum for current group members to chat with one another a shared list of favorite sites a shared photo gallery and or any other type of shared data files. New automatically updated services based upon the current group members may be offered. For example enhanced services based on the equipment capabilities of the group members may be offered when at least some group members upgrade hardware and or software.

The private group website is accessible only to members. Typically each member will be prompted for the group name and a password to enter. The group website may have text images audio and video information related to the group and also may include hyper links to other areas and services of interest to group members. A list of current group members may be displayed on the website or accessed by a hyperlink. The list also may indicate the online status of each group member note the last time a particular member visited the site and include short cut ways to communicate with group members e.g. right click to e mail or instant message .

In addition to other elements the shared buddy list includes the screen names of group members to facilitate instant messaging communication. In general a subscriber s buddy list is a user interface that lists the online status and capabilities of certain screen names i.e. buddies identified by the subscriber. In particular the buddy list interfaces with the host to identify which buddies are online i.e. currently accessing the host . The buddy list also facilitates instant messaging communication between subscribers. A subscriber can activate an instant messaging message window pre addressed to a buddy simply by clicking the screen name of a buddy on the buddy list. Otherwise the subscriber must activate and address a blank instant messaging window. When necessary a subscriber can look up the screen name of an intended recipient using the intended recipient s e mail address or other identifying information.

The shared address book may contain information about group members including but not limited to names addresses e.g. residential or business e mail addresses instant messaging screen names telephone numbers comments home page address and or any other personal information. The shared personal profile of a group member may include only that personal information desired by the member to be shared with the group or the Internet community at large.

The shared calendar may contain information about group members including but not limited to events appointments anniversaries birthdays holidays and or any other designated date. Group members may receive invitations and or reminders about important dates e.g. an invitation to attend an event .

The shared map may contain information including but not limited to home and work locations of members the current locations of members a meeting place an event location or any other designated area. Driving directions to and from locations also may be provided.

The shared message board provides a way for group members to post thoughts messages and or comments for subsequent viewers. After a post is made the group member may be prompted to e mail or instant message the post to some or all group members. The private on line forum allows group members to chat with one another. Group members may view who is in the chat room invite absent members to attend the chat session coordinate a time to visit the chat room and or engage in a spontaneous chat session with some or all other members visiting the group website.

The shared list of favorite sites may include but is not limited to group related websites favorite websites of members and or any other Internet site. Group members also may post recommendations and or opinions about certain links to web sites music books movies and the like. The shared photo gallery may include individual photographs or albums of photographs online. Group members may download and or order prints of the images. Current members also may share data files of any other type including but not limited to text files audio files image files video files and or multi media files.

The shared information associated with the automatically updated services is stored on the host system . In one implementation the host system includes a group administrator having a group member profile server and a database for storing information associated with group members. The group member profile server enters updates retrieves store edits manipulates or otherwise processes information stored in the database . The shared information associated with the automatically updated services may be stored in the database by group and or by individual subscriber. For example information associated with a particular subscriber may include but is not limited to a personal profile a buddy list an address book a calendar a list of favorite sites group memberships and or any other user preference.

The information associated with the automatically updated services typically will be provided to current members based upon information entered by at least one current member of the group. Group information however may be entered or supplemented by a person or a system outside of the group.

In one implementation upon receiving an affirmative response from the prospective member the group communicator instructs the group information updater to add the prospective member to the group. The group information updater updates the list of current members and adds the prospective member to the current members of the group. The group information updater then communicates the addition of the prospective member to the group administrator and instructs the group administrator to update the group member information. In one implementation the group information updater communicates with the group administrator through gateways .

The group administrator receives the notification and instruction regarding the updated group membership and in response updates the information associated with members of the group. In one implementation the group member profile server accesses the information stored in the database and populates the storage space associated with the members of the group with updated information. For example a buddy list associated with a current group member will be populated with the screen names of all the current members of the group including the screen names of the prospective members that have accepted an invitation. The buddy list of a group member is updated by adding screen names of new members and deleting screen names of former members. During an instant messaging session the group member is in constant communication with the IM server . The IM server in turn is in constant communication with the group member profile server and automatically updates the group members buddy list when a change to a group is made.

As shown in a UI illustrates an example of how the prospective member may be invited to join a Buddy List group by a current member . The UI presented to the prospective member includes the name of the group and the current members of the group . The UT provides buttons or other suitable graphical tools to allow the prospective member to accept the invitation or to reject the invitation . As an alternative to a button a hyperlink a pull down menu a popup menu or another graphical tool may be used to allow the prospective member to respond to the invitation.
