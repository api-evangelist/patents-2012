No. 13 228 333 filed Sep. 8 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 818 759 and entitled COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR REMOTE TESTING OF INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 174 659 filed Jun. 30 2011 and entitled INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 516 681 filed Apr. 5 2011 and entitled AIRCRAFT AIRBAGS WITH WIRELESS DIAGNOSTICS each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The technology disclosed herein relates generally to safety restraint systems and more specifically to electronics module assemblies for inflatable personal restraint systems.

Various types of seat belt and airbag systems have been used to protect passengers in automobiles aircraft and other vehicles. In automobiles airbags typically deploy from the steering column dashboard side panel and or other fixed locations. During a rapid deceleration event e.g. a collision a sensor detects the event and transmits a corresponding signal to an initiation device e.g. a pyrotechnic device on an airbag inflator. Initiation causes the inflator to release compressed gas into the airbag via a hose thereby rapidly inflating the airbag.

Although airbags that deploy from stationary locations e.g. a steering column may be effective in automobiles they may not be as effective in other types of vehicles having other seating arrangements. Seats in commercial passenger aircraft for example can be configured in a variety of layouts that provide different spacing between succeeding rows and adjacent seats. Moreover such layouts may lack the availability of stationary structures upon which to mount airbags. Additionally seatbacks in aircraft may rotate forward and downward during a crash or similar event and thus may be unsuitable for airbag storage. As a result airbags have been developed that deploy from seat belts to accommodate occupants in aircraft and other vehicles. Such airbags can deploy from for example a lap belt and or a shoulder belt to provide additional protection during a crash or other rapid deceleration event.

Seat belt airbag systems include an electronic activation system positioned on or proximate to the seat to initiate airbag inflation. Electronic activation systems typically include a crash sensor e.g. Hall effect sensors that uses a magnetic field to detect rapid decelerations which triggers a deployment circuit to activate the inflator and deploy the airbag. Some external magnetic fields such as those found in loudspeakers may be strong enough to activate the crash sensor and cause inadvertent airbag deployment. A magnetic shield typically made from an expensive and heavy Mu metal is therefore positioned over the crash sensor to prevent such external magnetic fields from interfering with the operation of the crash sensor.

The present disclosure describes electronics module assemblies EMAs and EMA enclosures for use with inflatable personal restraint systems such as airbag on aircraft. In one embodiment for example an EMA includes an enclosure or housing having a domed section or protrusion that forms an envelope of physical space around a crash sensor such a magnetically sensitive crash sensor. The protrusion reduces the likelihood that an external magnetic field e.g. from a nearby loud speaker or other transient source will inadvertently activate the crash sensor and prevent the deployment of an inflatable personal restraint system.

Certain details are set forth in the following description and in to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Other details describing well known structures and systems often associated with airbags inflators circuitry restraint systems etc. have not been set forth below to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the disclosure. Many of the details dimensions angles and other features shown in are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly other embodiments can add other details dimensions angles and features without departing from the spirit or scope of the present technology. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that further embodiments of the technology can be practiced without several of the details described below.

In the Figures identical reference numbers identify identical or at least generally similar elements. To facilitate the discussion of any particular element the most significant digit or digits of any reference number refers to the Figure in which that element is first introduced. For example element is first introduced and discussed with reference to .

In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment the restraint system includes an airbag assembly carried on a seat belt . More specifically in the illustrated embodiment the seat belt includes a first web portion and a corresponding second web portion . A proximal end portion of the first web portion can be fixably attached to the seat mounting structure by means of a hook or other suitable device known in the art. The proximal end portion of the second web portion can be similarly attached to the seat mounting structure on the opposite side of the seat . The distal end portion of the first web portion carries a connector having a tongue portion. The distal end portion of the second web portion carries a corresponding buckle configured to receive and releasably engage the tongue portion of the connector to couple the two web portions together around a seat occupant not shown in a conventional manner.

In a further aspect of the illustrated embodiment the airbag assembly includes an airbag that is attached to the first web portion generally proximate the connector . In one embodiment for example the airbag can be fastened to the first web portion using the methods and systems disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 086 134 which was filed Apr. 13 2011 and is incorporated herein by reference its entirety. In the airbag is illustrated in the non deployed configuration in which it is folded and stowed beneath a flexible and durable cover . The cover encloses the airbag and the first web portion and extends from the connector to a position adjacent to the hook . The cover includes one or more tear seams not shown that are designed to rupture upon airbag inflation enabling the airbag to fully inflate.

In yet another aspect of the illustrated embodiment the airbag assembly includes an inflator hose having a first end portion in fluid communication with the interior of the airbag and a second end portion that carries a coupling . The coupling is configured to be operably e.g. threadably engaged with an outlet of an airbag inflator . A pair of wires is operably coupled to an ignitor or bridge wire in the inflator and extends from the inflator to an electrical connector . The electrical connector can operably couple the inflator to an EMA for controlling the deployment of the airbag during a rapid deceleration event e.g. a crash of sufficient magnitude.

In the illustrated embodiment the EMA includes a microprocessor that receives electrical power from a power source e.g. one or more lithium batteries . The EMA further includes at least one crash sensor that detect rapid deceleration and one or more magnetic field sensors that detect the presence of an external magnetic field. Upon detection of an external magnetic field the magnetic field sensors communicate with the microprocessor to deactivate the crash sensor and prevent inadvertent deployment of the airbag . The magnetic field sensors can be at least generally similar to the magnetic field sensors described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 535 115 filed Mar. 13 2000 entitled AIR BAG HAVING MAGNETIC FIELD PROTECTION CIRCUITRY which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. As described in greater detail below the EMA can include protective housing that has additional features that prevent the EMA from inadvertently deploying the airbag .

In operation when the crash sensor detects a crash or other rapid deceleration event above a preset magnitude switches in the crash sensor close and cause the microprocessor to send a corresponding signal to a deployment circuit . Upon receiving a signal from the microprocessor the deployment circuit applies a sufficient voltage to a circuit that includes the ignitor thereby causing the inflator associated with the seat to discharge its compressed gas into the airbag via the hose . The compressed gas expands and causes the airbag to inflate and provides the seat occupant not shown with additional protection during the crash event.

The foregoing discussion provides a high level overview of some of the structures and functions of the personal restraint system in accordance with one embodiment of the present technology. Additional features of seat belt airbag systems are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5 984 350 which is owned by the assignee of the present application and is incorporated herein in by reference in its entirety. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various aspects and features of the various subsystems of the personal restraint system described above can be utilized in combination with other systems without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. For example in certain embodiments the airbag assembly described above can be used with an EMA that rather than including a microprocessor can simply include a power source and a crash sensor that completes a circuit to activate an inflator during a crash event. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that additional airbag assemblies e.g. a second and third airbag assembly or more can be operably coupled to the EMA for use with the other seats in the row adjacent to the seat . Accordingly in one embodiment if a row of seats in an aircraft includes three seats each seat can be outfitted with a seat belt airbag assembly as described above with each of the airbag assemblies coupled to an individual inflator as illustrated in . All three of the airbag assemblies however can be initiated by the single EMA .

In the illustrated embodiment the housing includes a raised portion or protrusion that extends outwardly from a generally planar surface of the first portion . The protrusion can have virtually any shape such as a domed shaped rectilinear shape irregular shape and or other suitable shape. As shown in the interface between the generally planar surface and the protrusion can define an outer boundary of the protrusion e.g. the point at which the protrusion projects away from the generally planar surface . The crash sensor can be positioned in an area defined by the outer boundary with the protrusion oriented over the crash sensor e.g. as shown in and therefore the protrusion can form an envelope of physical space or a clearance envelope around the crash sensor . In this manner the protrusion defines the minimum distance that can exist between an object e.g. a magnetic object positioned outside the housing and the crash sensor . In various aspects of the technology the size of the protrusion can be selected based on the minimum distance that an external object with a magnetic field above a predetermined threshold can come to the crash sensor without activating it.

The crash sensor can include various types of switches known in the art for responding to a rapid deceleration or acceleration event including magnetically activated reed switches and or Hall effect sensors. In one embodiment for example the crash sensor includes two reed switches and a magnet aligned along a common axis e.g. an axis of forward motion of the vehicle such that a rapid deceleration event moves the magnet from a resting position to an active position over the reed switches. The magnetic field closes the reed switches and complete circuits within the EMA to initiate airbag deployment. In other embodiments the crash sensor can include switches that can be at least generally similar in structure and function to the switches in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 170 079 filed Jun. 27 2011 and entitled SENSORS FOR DETECTING RAPID DECELERATION ACCELERATION EVENTS which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In further embodiments the crash sensor can include a Hall effect sensor that varies its output voltage in response to a change in the magnetic field to initiate airbag deployment. In still further embodiments the EMA can include more than one crash sensor for redundancy to ensure that at least one crash sensor operates properly in response to a rapid deceleration event.

Because the crash sensor can be magnetically activated the EMA may also include one or more magnetic field sensors e.g. reed switches Hall effect sensors etc. that detect the presence of an external magnetic field above a predetermined magnitude. The magnetic field sensors for example can be configured to detect external magnetic fields strong enough to interfere with the operation of the crash sensor and or other portions of the EMA . The magnetic field sensors can be operably coupled to a deployment circuit such that when the magnetic field sensors detect an external magnetic field e.g. produced by strong magnets of the type found in loudspeakers and or other portable electronic devices the magnetic field sensors can switch open or closed to deactivate the deployment circuit. In various embodiments two or more magnetic field sensor can be positioned proximate one another for redundancy.

In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment the electronics of the EMA are operably coupled to a printed circuit board PCB fitted within the housing using screws and or other suitable fasteners. The crash sensor for example can be mounted on the PCB and magnetic field sensors can be operably coupled thereto. Additionally one or more power cells such as lithium ion batteries or other suitable power sources can be positioned on the underside of the PCB . A connector can be operably coupled to the PCB and protrude through an opening of the housing such that the EMA can communicate with other portions of an inflatable personal restraint system e.g. the restraint system of .

In yet another aspect of the illustrated embodiment the EMA can include a diagnostic initiation button and a number of diagnostic indicators operably coupled to the electronics of the EMA e.g. the crash sensor the magnetic field sensors the microprocessor etc. via connection wires that extend through an opening into the housing . The diagnostic indicators can visually indicate whether the electronics associated with each personal restraint system e.g. the inflatable personal restraint systems in positions and are operating properly. In various embodiments for example the diagnostic indicators can be light emitting diodes LEDs and or other suitable lighting devices that illuminate when a diagnostic test indicates that the electronics are operating properly. A diagnostic test of the EMA can be initiated by pressing the diagnostic initiation button wirelessly communicating with the EMA connecting a diagnostic test machine to the connector and or using other suitable diagnostic test methods.

In a further aspect of the illustrated embodiment the magnetic field sensors are positioned within the protrusion . for example shows support features on an inner or concave surface of the protrusion for securing the magnetic field sensors within the protrusion . In other embodiments the magnetic fields sensors can be releasably or permanently secured to the inner surface and or other surfaces of the protrusion using other suitable attachment mechanisms.

The size of the protrusion can be selected to allow the magnetic field sensors to detect an external magnetic field before it comes close enough to the crash sensor to interfere with the operation of the crash sensor . This allows the magnetic field sensor to detect an external magnetic field and disable the crash sensor before it inadvertently initiates airbag deployment. Therefore the protrusion in conjunction with the magnetic field sensors eliminates the need for a magnetic shield that is typically positioned over a crash sensor to shield it from external magnetic fields and prevent inadvertent airbag deployment. Such magnetic shields are typically made from a thick piece of Mu metal which is both expensive and heavy. Accordingly the elimination of the magnetic shield reduces the cost weight and size of the EMA .

Those of ordinary skill in the art for example will appreciate that the EMA can include a number of other components and features for diagnostics redundancy etc. which have not been described herein to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the general description of various embodiments of the present technology. Additionally specific elements of any of the foregoing embodiments can be combined or substituted for elements in other embodiments. Moreover the restraint system described above can be incorporated in non automobile or non aircraft systems. Certain aspects of the disclosure are accordingly not limited to automobile or aircraft systems. Furthermore while advantages associated with certain embodiments of the disclosure have been described in the context of these embodiments other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the technology.
