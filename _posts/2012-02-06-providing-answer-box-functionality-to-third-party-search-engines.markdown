This application is a continuation of International Application Serial No. PCT CN2010 073813 filed on Jun. 11 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference.

This specification relates to search engines and in one particular example to enriching a search engine results page with results that are generated by a search engine and with answers that are generated by a different search engine.

An answer box is a web search feature that provides users with answers to questions that are associated with search queries. For example a search engine may receive a search query that includes specific query keywords that relate to everyday essential information e.g. weather or time reference tools e.g. how many convert n n how big is trip planning information e.g. show time how far is map where or other information. Instead of providing links or snippets of text that reference other web pages the search engine may return a results page with an answer box that directly answers a question that is stated by or that is implicit to a search query.

Initially as used by this specification the term answer box refers to a graphical element of a web page that provides an answer to a question that is stated by or that is implicit to a search query. The term answer box result refers to the formatted information that appears in an answer box in response to specific query keywords. The web search feature known as OneBox by Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif. is one example of a web service that generates and displays answer boxes.

This specification refers to the specific query keywords that cause a search engine to obtain an answer box result or to generate an answer box as trigger terms or triggers. A trigger term may be associated with a type or category of answer box such as movie weather convert how . . . is stock price or the trigger term may be associated with a parameter such as a particular person name e.g. to obtain a social network status update a particular movie name e.g. to obtain show times a particular location e.g. to obtain weather or time information or a particular business name e.g. to obtain stock information . The trigger terms may explicitly state or may imply a question for which a user is seeking an answer.

Some trigger terms may require a parameter for example where the trigger term time requires a parameter in order to determine a location for which the time information is to be obtained. Alternatively trigger terms may not require a parameter to be explicitly provided for example where a parameter e.g. a default location may be inferred for a trigger term.

In generating an answer box for a search query a search engine may obtain information to include in an answer box result from one or more data sources. The answer box result may include formatted information that instantly answers a question that is implicit to or that is explicitly stated by a search query. The answer box result may include current or real time information such as current weather stock price show time location or other information. In other implementations the answer box result does not include real time information for example when trigger term is an address and the answer box result includes map information for the address. The answer box result may include textual information e.g. a temperature graphical information e.g. a weather icon or other types of information e.g. a sound file .

In general one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating by a search engine that does not include answer box functionality a search engine results page that includes an answer box using information that is generated by another search engine that does include answer box functionality.

In general another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving by a search engine a search query generating one or more search results that are responsive to the search query generating an answer box request based on the search query transmitting the answer box request to another search engine receiving in response to the answer box request an answer box result from the other search engine generating a search engine results page that includes one or more of the search results and that includes an answer box that references information included in the answer box result and providing the search engine results page.

In general another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving by a search engine a search query generating one or more search results that are responsive to the search query generating an answer box request based on the search query transmitting the answer box request to another search engine receiving in response to the answer box request data that indicates that the other search engine has not identified an answer to a question that is stated by or that is implicit to the search query based on receiving the data generating a search engine results page that includes one or more of the search results and that does not include an answer box and providing the search engine results page.

Other embodiments of each of these aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices each configured to perform the actions of the methods.

These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features alone or in combination. For instance the information included in the answer box result answers a question that is stated by or that is implicit to the search query the answer box request includes the search query the answer box request specifies a type of answer box result that is to be generated by the other search engine the actions further include invoking a search engine results page template that includes code that causes the answer box request to be generated and transmitted the actions further include receiving code from the other search engine the code when generated causing the answer box request to be generated and transmitted and embedding the code in a search engine results page template the information included in the answer box result represents current information at a time when or after the answer box request has been transmitted the search query includes query terms and generating the answer box request comprises selecting a subset of the query terms selecting the subset of the query terms further includes selecting one or more types of answer boxes that the other search engine is to generate and selecting as the subset the query terms that correspond to the types of answer boxes the search engine results page is generated by a desktop search engine the answer box request is an Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX request and or the search engine is provided by a first search engine provider and the other search engine is provided by a different second search engine provider.

Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification may be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The user may request an answer box using a search engine that does not provide answer box functionality and the search engine results page associated with a search engine that does not provide answer box functionality may include an answer box. Similarly the user may request an answer box without accessing the web site of another search engine that does include answer box functionality. Because the user does not need to switch search engines in order to obtain an answer box the user may enjoy a more rewarding and intuitive search experience.

The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

This specification refers to the search engine as an answer box search engine and as including answer box functionality because the search engine may generate answer boxes and or answer box results such as by obtaining formatted information from one or more data sources in response to a search query. The search engine is referred to as a third party search engine and as not including answer box functionality because other than receiving answer boxes and answer box results from another search engine it does not itself generate answer boxes or answer box results and or because it is operated by a different search engine provider than the search engine . The search engine which may be implemented on the client device e.g. as a desktop search engine may not be capable of generating answer boxes or answer box results or may choose not to generate answer boxes or answer box results.

During state a the user of the client device enters query terms time London map into a search box on the search engine home page and selects a user interface control to initiate a search query. As used by this specification a search query includes one or more query terms that a user submits to a search engine when the user requests the search engine to perform a search query where a term or a query term includes one or more whole or partial words characters or strings of characters.

During state b the client device communicates a search query that includes the query terms over the networks to the search engine . A search application on the search engine generates search results that are responsive to the search query e.g. using one or more processors . As contrasted with an answer box result a result of the search query or search result includes a Uniform Resource Identifier URI that references a resource that the search engine determines to be responsive to the search query . The search results may include other things such as a title preview image ratings map or directions description of the corresponding resource or a snippet of text that has been automatically or manually extracted from or otherwise associated with the corresponding resource. The search application may for instance generate the search result that includes a link to a resource entitled Travel Time Tube Map in response to processing the query terms time London map. 

During state c an answer box selector of the search engine selects a subset of the query terms and communicates an answer box request that references the query terms of the subset to the answer box search engine over the networks . The subset of the query terms may include all of the query terms or fewer than all of the query terms . The answer box selector may select the subset of the query terms after selecting the types of answer boxes that it infers are to be obtained from the search engine and by selecting the particular query terms that are trigger terms or parameters which correspond to those types of answer boxes. Communicating the answer box request to the answer box search engine may be tantamount to transmitting all or some of the query terms to a search engine provider that is different than the provider of the search engine or to a different search engine that is provided by the same search engine provider as the search engine .

In for example the answer box selector may determine e.g. based on user preferences or the user s past search history that map related answer boxes should not be obtained but that time related answer boxes should be obtained. Accordingly the answer box selector may select the query terms time and London since they include a trigger term and a parameter respectively that correspond to a time related answer box. The answer box selector may filter the query term map since it is not a trigger term or a parameter that corresponds to a time related answer box or alternatively because it is a trigger term that is associated with a map related answer box. The answer box selector may also add data to the answer box request such as context information answer box type flags or other trigger terms or parameters to aid the search engine in generating or prioritizing particular answer boxes and or answer box results.

The search engine may use a results template to generate search engine results pages that include both search results and answer boxes. For instance the results template may include formatted text e.g. title text answer box header text and search results header text and graphical elements e.g. search box answer box display region and search results display region that are displayed on all search engine results pages generated by the search engine .

In addition to visual elements the results template may include code that when executed by the search engine while generating a search engine results page causes the answer box display region to populate with an answer box or an answer box result that the search engine itself does not generate. Specifically the results template may include an answer box search engine application programming interface API code that when invoked by the search engine triggers the selection of the subset of the query terms and the transmission of the query terms or the subset to the search engine . The results template may include other code such as search results code that when invoked by the third party search engine causes the search results display region to populate with search results.

During state d an answer box application on the answer box search engine generates an answer box result that is responsive to the selected query terms e.g. using one or more processors . The answer box result may include information was locally stored by the search engine before the answer box request was received or the answer box result may include information that was generated or dynamically obtained from another data source after the answer box request was received.

Because the query terms of the subset time London imply that the user has a question about the time in London the search engine obtains an answer to this question when the answer box request is received. Specifically the search engine may obtain current time information 12 53 pm for the location identified in the subset London from a time server in response to receiving the answer box request . The search engine includes the current time information in the answer box result and communicates the answer box result over the networks to the search engine .

During state e the search engine generates code e.g. Hypertext Markup Language HTML code or eXtensible Markup Language XML code for the search engine results page . The search engine then communicates the code over the networks to the client device .

The search engine results page includes a search box the search result generated by the search engine and an answer box that includes the current time information obtained by the answer box search engine . The third party search engine may generate the search engine results page by populating the answer box display region with the current time information and by populating the search results display region with the search result . During state f the client device invokes the code e.g. using a web browser and displays the search engine results page .

A third party search engine receives the search query from over the network and optionally filters or otherwise processes the query to generate an answer box request. For example the third party search engine may select a subset of the query terms included in the search query and may transmit only the query terms of the subset in the answer box request. Alternatively the third party search engine may append data to the search query before it is transmitted to the answer box search engine as the answer box request to specify a particular type of answer box for which to generate formatted information. Furthermore the third party search engine may send the search query itself to the answer box search engine as the answer box request.

The third party search engine transmits the answer box request over the network to another search engine such as the answer box search engine . The other search engine may be operated or managed by the same search engine provider or by a different search engine provider. The third party search engine also generates search results before during and or after processing or transmitting the answer box request.

A search engine results page template may include code e.g. JavaScript or VBScript or instructions that cause the third party search engine to transmit the answer box request. The code may have been received from the answer box search engine and may have been embedded in the search engine results page template before receiving the search query. The instructions may also be script functions that are inserted into a web page such as a home start or search page associated with the third party search engine.

In one example the answer box search engine is identified by the Uniform Resource Locator URL www.example.com and the code is a portable program module script such as 

In another example the answer box request is an Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX request such as XXX 0 1 3 5 6 7

In the above example XXX represents the query term and 0 1 3 5 6 7 specifies the types of answer boxes that the answer box search engine is to generate. One example of an answer box type list is . . . 

The answer box search engine receives the answer box request and parses or analyzes the answer box request to determine if any of the query terms included in the answer box request are trigger terms and or parameters . Determining that the search request includes a trigger term may include automatically parsing the search request into candidate trigger terms and comparing the candidate trigger terms to a list of known trigger terms such as a list of known category trigger terms e.g. weather time stock or a list of known parameters e.g. business people or place names .

The candidate trigger terms may be filtered to exclude those trigger terms that require a parameter that is missing or that require a parameter does not occur in a particular required sequence. For instance the candidate trigger term time may be excluded as a candidate trigger term if a location parameter is required and if the parameter following the trigger term time on the web page does not reference a location.

If none of the query terms included in the answer box request are trigger terms and or parameters No the answer box search engine generates a no result answer box result and transmits the no result response to the third party search engine . If the answer box request includes trigger terms and or parameters YES the answer box search engine generates an answer box result that includes formatted information that answers a question that is stated by or that is implicit in the trigger terms and or parameters . Answer box results may be obtained by performing an answer box search on a local search engine using a trigger term and or parameter or by initiating a call to an appropriate web service.

The answer box result is transmitted to the third party search engine . Answer box results may be transmitted using a particular data type or format such as an array of strings or using XML or JavaScript Object Notation JSON .

The third party search engine receives the answer box result or the no result result and generates a search engine results page that includes the search results generated by the third party search engine and if the answer box generated formatted information and did not generate a no result response an answer box that includes the formatted information .

The third party search engine may use a template to generate the search engine results page. The template may include an answer box container to host the answer box results. In one embodiment an HTML is included in the search engine results page to host the answer box result. One example of a layer that may be used to define the answer box container is 

The template may also define parameters that specify when and how to call the answer box search engine what types of answer boxes should be generated by the answer box search engine and how the answer box should appear on the search engine results page. For instance the template may specify which types of answer boxes should be generated and may attach a function to one or more objects to initialize the selected answer box types. In one example the template may specify an identifier of an the answer box container and an identifier of an answer box type.

If the answer box search engine only returns a no result response the third party search engine may select a search engine results page template that is not associated with answer boxes. The third party search engine may populate this template with the search results without incorporating any information received from the answer box search engine.

The third party search engine transmits code e.g. HTML code for the search engine results page over the network to the client device . The client device receives and invokes the code for the search engine results page from the third party search engine and provides the search engine results page for display thereby ending the process .

The answer box is generated by the search engine in response to detecting the trigger term time in the query terms . In generating an answer box the search engine has inferred that the query terms implicitly ask the question what is the current local time in London The time information displayed in the answer box answers this question for each of three locations named London. 

Unlike where the user accessed a search engine that includes answer box functionality the user may obtain an answer box while they are working on a desktop search or using a different search engine without first determining whether or not the search engine itself includes answer box functionality and without halting their current search session to change search engines.

A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For example various forms of the flows shown above may be used with steps re ordered added or removed. Accordingly other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.

Embodiments and all of the functional operations described in this specification may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer software firmware or hardware including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments may be implemented as one or more computer program products i.e. one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus. The computer readable medium may be a machine readable storage device a machine readable storage substrate a memory device a composition of matter effecting a machine readable propagated signal or a combination of one or more of them. The term data processing apparatus encompasses all apparatus devices and machines for processing data including by way of example a programmable processor a computer or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus may include in addition to hardware code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question e.g. code that constitutes processor firmware a protocol stack a database management system an operating system or a combination of one or more of them. A propagated signal is an artificially generated signal e.g. a machine generated electrical optical or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus.

A computer program also known as a program software software application script or code may be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it may be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program may be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code . A computer program may be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

The processes and logic flows described in this specification may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows may also be performed by and apparatus may also be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. an FPGA field programmable gate array or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit .

Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer will also include or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. However a computer need not have such devices. Moreover a computer may be embedded in another device e.g. a tablet computer a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile audio player a Global Positioning System GPS receiver to name just a few. Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory media and memory devices including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The processor and the memory may be supplemented by or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.

To provide for interaction with a user embodiments may be implemented on a computer having a display device e.g. a CRT cathode ray tube or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse or a trackball by which the user may provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices may be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user may be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user may be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input.

Embodiments may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user may interact with an implementation or any combination of one or more such back end middleware or front end components. The components of the system may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication e.g. a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet.

The computing system may include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.

While this specification contains many specifics these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosure or of what may be claimed but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments may also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment may also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination may in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments and it should be understood that the described program components and systems may generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

In each instance where an HTML file is mentioned other file types or formats may be substituted. For instance an HTML file may be replaced by an XML JSON plain text or other types of files. Moreover where a table or hash table is mentioned other data structures such as spreadsheets relational databases or structured files may be used.

Thus particular embodiments have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. For example the actions recited in the claims may be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results.
