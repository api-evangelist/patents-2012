title: Enhanced physical downlink control channel (ePDCCH) inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC)
abstract: Technology for communicating enhanced physical downlink control channels (ePDCCHs) configured for inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) for a plurality of cells in a physical resource block (PRB) is disclosed. One method can include a node mapping a serving cell control channel element (CCE) in an serving cell ePDCCH in a PRB and a coordination cell CCE in a coordination cell ePDCCH in the PRB. The node can transmit the map of the serving cell CCE and the coordination cell CCE to a wireless device.
