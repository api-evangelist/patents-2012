The present invention relates to the generation of images from projection measurements. Examples of images generated from projection measurements include two dimensional and three dimensional SAR synthetic aperture radar systems. SAR is a form of radar in which the large highly directional rotating antenna used by conventional radar is replaced with many low directivity small stationary antennas scattered over some area near or around the target area. The many echo waveforms received at the different antenna positions are post processed to resolve the target. SAR can be implemented by moving one or more antennas over relatively immobile targets by placing multiple stationary antennas over a relatively large area or combinations thereof. A further example of images generated from projection measurements are ISAR inverse SAR systems which image objects and many features on the ground from satellites aircraft vehicles or any other moving platform. SAR and ISAR systems are used in detecting locating and sometimes identifying ships ground vehicles mines buried pipes roadway faults tunnels leaking buried pipes etc. as well as discovering and measuring geological features forest features mining volumes etc. and general mapping. For example as shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5 805 098 to McCorkle hereby incorporated by reference an aircraft mounted detector array is utilized to take ground radar measurements. Other examples of systems using projection measurements are fault inspection systems using acoustic imaging submarine sonar for imaging underwater objects seismic imaging system for tunnel detection oil exploration geological surveys etc. and medical diagnostic tools such as sonograms echocardiograms x ray CAT computer aided tomography equipment and MRI magnetic resonance imaging equipment.

where wis the weight factor and f i k is the delay index to s t necessary to coherently integrate the value for pixel P i from the measured data at receiving element k.

The index is computed using the round trip distance between the transmitting element the target point forming the image pixel and the receiving element. The transmitting element is located at the coordinate x k y k z k . The distance between the transmitting element and the target point forming the image pixel P i is 

The height of the vehicle mounted radar may be approximately 2 m from the ground. The imaging center may be located at approximately 20 in from the radar but for various target resolutions the imaging centers may be located at various ranges. For simplicity a fixed range is used for to form imagery and the motion of the vehicle is not shown. In practice however imagery is formed using the physical aperture of the antenna array and the synthetic aperture SAR generated by the forward motion of the vehicle. This two dimensional aperture gives not only the crossrange resolution from physical aperture of the antenna array but also the height resolution from the forward motion and thus results in a 3 dimensional image see Nguyen L. H. Ton T. T. Wong D. C. Ressler M. A. Signal Processing Techniques for Forward Imaging Using Ultrawideband Synthetic Aperture Radar. 5083 505 2003 hereby incorporated by reference. This approach also provides integration to achieve a better signal to noise ratio in the resulting image.

The following is a description of the platform in as it passes four sequential positions located at x coordinates A B C D respectively. The formation of the first sub image begins when platform is at the coordinate A 20 meters from the block labeled 1sub image. As platform travels in the x direction as shown in signals emitted from platform illuminates an entire image area to the right of platform and the reflected signals are received by an array of 16 physical receiving antennas positioned on the front of the platform . Formation of the first sub image ends when platform reaches coordinate C at approximately 8 m from the block labeled 1sub image. Accordingly the radar signal data for the first full resolution sub image is received as radar platform travels a distance of 12 meters 20 m 8 m 12 m from coordinates A to C for formation of a two dimensional 2D aperture.

The distance traveled during the formation of the two dimensional 2 D aperture is represented by an arrow in labeled Aperture . When the platform reaches coordinate B a distance of 2 meters from coordinate A in the formation of the 2sub image begins and as the platform travels to coordinate D it uses the received data to form a second 2 D aperture. The distance traveled by platform is represented by an arrow in labeled Aperture . Note that the two apertures are overlapped by 10 m and the second aperture is advanced by 2 m with respect to the first aperture. Sub images and are formed from the 2 D apertures using the same length of travel 12 meters of the radar. This process is applied to ensure that image pixels have almost the same within a specified tolerance resolution across the entire large area. The sub images are formed from the radar range profiles using the back projection algorithm.

Many applications such as radar and communication systems have been exploiting features that wide bandwidth signals offer. However the implementation of front end receivers to directly digitize these wide bandwidth signals requires that the analog to digital converter ADC digitize the wide bandwidth signals at a frequency above the minimum Nyquist rate. According to Wikipedia the Nyquist theorem shows that an analog signal can be perfectly reconstructed from an infinite sequence of samples if the sampling rate exceeds 2B samples per second where B is the highest frequency of the original signal. In the case of time domain impulse based Ultra Wideband UWB radar to be above the Nyquist rate the clock speed of the front end analog to digital converter ADC must be higher than twice the highest frequency content of the wide bandwidth signal having a bandwidth from 300 MHz to 3000 MHz. In practice the received radar data is directly digitized at an equivalent sampling rate of 7.720 Giga samples sec which is slightly higher than the required Nyquist sampling rate of at least 6 Giga samples sec.

Because of this challenge state of the art systems employ various time equivalent sampling techniques that allow the reconstruction of the Wideband signals from slower sampling rates. These equivalent time sampling techniques are based on the assumption that a signal waveform is repeatable for many observations. By acquiring the same signal waveform at different phase delays with sub Nyquist sampling rate the signal waveform can be reconstructed by interleaving data from individual observations. In other words these time equivalent techniques depend on many observations of the same single waveform of interest via interleaving data from individual observations to reconstruct the original information. These techniques do not work if there is only one chance to observe the signal or the acquired signal is not repeatable from one observation to the next. In addition since it takes many observations of a signal waveform in order to complete one acquisition cycle hence the term equivalent time the effective data acquisition rate is much slower than the real time data acquisition which uses analog to digital converters ADCs that operate at above Nyquist rate. The equivalent time data acquisition results in many disadvantages such as slower data acquisition time lower pulse repetition rate PRF lower average power etc. In several practical applications the assumption that a signal is repeatable for many measurements might not be practical or not even realizable.

In the case of Ultra Wideband UWB radar which has advantageous penetration capability due to low frequency contents and the high resolution due to the wide bandwidth of the transmit signals a technique referred to as synchronous impulse reconstruction SIRE sampling technique has employed an equivalent time sampling technique that allows the reconstruction of wide bandwidth signal using analog to digital converters ADCs operating under the Nyquist rate. The ARL SIRE radar system employs an Analog Devices 12 bit ADC to digitize the returned radar signals. However the ADC is clocked at the system clock rate of 40 MHz. From the well known sampling theory it is not possible to reconstruct the Wide Bandwidth signal 300 Mhz to 3000 Mhz since the clock rate of the ADC is much slower than the required minimum Nyquist sampling rate in this case 6000 MHz . However by using the synchronous time equivalent sampling technique a much higher effective sampling rate is achieved. provides a graphical representation of the SIRE acquisition technique. Further details are described in Nguyen L. Signal and Image Processing Algorithms for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Ultra wideband UWB Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE radar Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL. TR 4784 April 2009 hereby incorporated by reference and Ressler Marc et al.

The analog to digital converter ADC sampling period is the value of this parameter in is 25 ns which corresponds to the A D sampling rate of 40 MHz. The number of samples for each range profile is denoted by N which is equal to 7 in our current configuration. This value corresponds to a range swath of 26 m. The system pulse repetition frequency PRF is 1 MHz. The system pulse repetition interval PRI the inverse of PRF is 1 ms. Each aliased sub Nyquist sampling radar record is measured M times 1024 in the example of and they are integrated to achieve higher signal to noise level. After summing M repeated measurements of the same range profile the first range fast time bin is increased by . Thus the next group of M range profiles are digitized with a timing offset of with respect to the transmit pulse. The parameter represents a time sample spacing that satisfies the Nyquist criterion for the transmitted radar signal. This time sample spacing is 129.53 ps which corresponds to a sampling rate of 7.72 GHz. This effective sampling rate is sufficient for the wide bandwidth radar signal 300 MHz 3000 MHz . The number of interleaved samples is

As previously mentioned the advantage of the equivalent time sampling technique is that it relieves the clock rate requirements for the ADCs. However there are two major problems. First the data acquisition time has been significantly increased. Second the technique is based on the assumption that the signal is the same from one observation to the next. In this case the radar and all targets in the scene must be stationary during the entire data acquisition cycle. If this condition is met the received signal will be perfectly reconstructed by interleaving the data from many returned waveforms from many observations. However this assumption does not often hold in practice since the relative position between the radar and the targets is no longer negligible during the data acquisition cycle due to the motion of the radar platform. This is even worse for the forward looking radar geometry since the radar in this case moves toward the imaging area. Even with the slow speed of the platform 1 mile per hour the relative motion between the radar and the targets during the data acquisition cycle results in severe phase and shape distortions in the reconstructed signal. This in turn results in poor focus quality and low signal to noise level in SAR imagery. Although some of these artifacts can be corrected by signal processing algorithms this time equivalent technique would definitely limit the maximum speed of the radar platform.

The SIRE sampling technique a modified and enhanced version of the equivalent time sampling technique used in commercial digital storage oscilloscopes and other radar systems allows the employment of inexpensive A D converters to digitize the wide bandwidth signals. However like other equivalent time sampling techniques the basic assumption is that the signal is repeatable from one observation to the next. Thus by acquiring the same waveform with many observations with different phase offsets the under sampled data records are then interleaved for the reconstruction of the equivalent over sampled data record. This results in many side effects that include the distortion of the captured waveform due to the relative motion of the radar and the target during the data acquisition cycle returned radar waveforms have been changed during the acquisition cycle . In addition the equivalent time data acquisition translates to lower average power and lower effective pulse repetition frequency PRF for the SAR system. Other state of the art implementations include the use of multiple ADCs in a parallel configuration to increase the effective sampling rate and reduce the data acquisition time. However the use of parallel ADCs significantly increases the size weight power and cost of the receiver.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a sparse recovery model based SMB sub Nyquist sampling and reconstruction scheme. SMB allows the reconstruction of a wideband signal that is sampled at a much slower rate than Nyquist s in real time with a single observation . One advantage of this technique is that the high clock rate of the front end analog to digital converter ADC can be lowered. By lowering the required clock rate of the ADC there is significant reduction in the size weight power and cost for the implementation of the receiver. This is important for a system with multiple receiving channels e.g. the ARL UWB radar system has 16 receiving channels or a network of sensors. Another advantage of the preferred embodiment technique is that it also offers data compression. This technique allows each receiver to digitize a signal waveform at a much slower rate reducing the required transmission bandwidth especially for the implementation of networks of sensors.

The sparsity driven model based SMB sub Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique of the preferred embodiment is a real time sampling technique not equivalent time. That means the sampling of the signal is performed using only a single observation at a sampling rate which is much slower than the required sampling rate Nyquist via a single slow inexpensive ADC. After this real time sub Nyquist sampling is performed the signal is reconstructed using the preferred embodiment SMB reconstruction technique.

The preferred embodiment sparsity driven model based SMB sub Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique allows the wideband signals to be sampled at a much slower rate than the required minimum sampling rate. This preferred embodiment technique is a real time sampling scheme not equivalent time which means the sampling of the signal is performed using only a single observation at a sampling rate much slower than the required sampling rate Nyquist using a slow inexpensive off the shelf ADC. After the real time sub Nyquist sampling is performed the signal is reconstructed using the invented sparsity driven reconstruction technique.

The first advantage of this technique is that we can lower the requirement of the high clock rate of the front end ADC. By lowering the required clock rate of the ADC this would result in the significant reduction in the size weight power and cost for the implementation the receiver. This is even more important for a system with multiple receiving channels such as the ARL UWB radar system or a network of sensors. Another advantage is that this technique also naturally offers the data compression feature allowing each receiver to digitize a signal waveform at a much slower rate which leads to a tremendous reduction in the required transmission bandwidth especially for the implementation of multiple sensors or networks of sensors. The collected samples can be transmitted directly without any additional compression for bandwidth reduction.

The key innovative concept in the invention is that although much of the information is lost in the receive signal due to the low sampling rate of the receiver the signal can be modeled as a linear combination of time shifted versions of the transmitted waveforms. Thus by constructing a redundant dictionary that composes time shifted versions of the transmit waveform the SMB technique solves for a sparse solution of the coefficients that represent the significant components contributing to the received signal. Using simulated data as well as real world data from the ARL UWB radar it has been demonstrates that the SMB technique successfully models and synthesizes the radar data from real life scenes using only a handful of coefficients. The SAR image reconstruction using the SMB reconstruction technique on sub Nyquist sampling data is well matched with the original over sampling SAR image while conventional interpolation techniques when asked to recover the missing information may fail.

Although the invention is demonstrated with the application of this technique to radar applications the sampling and reconstruction technique of the present invention also works with other communication systems especially ones that employ ultra high frequency modulation schemes.

Angular resolution is determined by the size of the receiving antenna array and the synthetic aperture generated by the motion of the vehicle. At a given range the ability to resolve objects or targets in the cross range direction is known as the cross range resolution. Similarly the ability to resolve objects or targets in the down range direction is known as down range resolution. The down range resolution of the SAR system according to the present invention is generally provided by the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse from transmitting elements having a wide range of frequency. The cross range resolution is provided by both the array of receiving elements and the radar generated by the moving platform. Additionally the radar antenna array may include two symmetrical sub systems a first or forward looking group of antenna elements and or second or backward looking group of antenna elements. Each group may include two transmitting elements e.g. a transmitter and transmitting antenna and eight receiving elements e.g. a receiver and receiving antenna . Each receiving antenna feeds its own receiver and functions essentially as a digitizing system. To that end each receiving antenna feeds an analog signal or data to each receiver which in turn converts or processes the analog data or signal in digitized form. The digitized data generated from each receiver of each receiving element is combined and sent to processor which then performs data processing tasks on the digitized signal e.g. removal of interference from the digitized backprojection signal motion compensation filtering and forming SAR imagery using known image processing techniques as outlined in Signal and Image Processing Algorithms for the Army Research Lab Ultra Wideband Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction UWB SIRE Radar Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL TR 4784 2009 by Lam Nguyen which is incorporated herein by reference.

Part of the Compressed Sampling appeal comes from the implication that a sparse signal can be sampled at a rate much lower than the traditional Nyquist sampling rate. Compressed sensing CS is a novel sampling theory which is based on exploiting sparsity or compressibility when acquiring signals of general interest. Compressed sensing designs non adaptive sampling techniques that condense the information in a compressible signal into a small amount of data. From the CS framework certain signals or images can be reconstructed from much fewer samples than the traditional sampling methods provided that the signals are sparse in certain domains. Although the CS framework offers data compression it still does not address the drawback described in the Background section that is the data acquisition must be operated in equivalent time since many global measurements obtained from global random projections are required as depicted by the sensing matrix in the CS framework. Note that in the following bold face characters denote vectors while bold faced uppercase characters denote matrices

Let be the sampling matrix of size M N. The digitized waveform is obtained from Equation 3A . where y is a vector with M entries containing the measurements discrete samples of the signal x and represents an M N incoherent sensing matrix usually constructed from random Gaussian matrices.

For the conventional sampling process the analog to digital converter ADC is clocked at above Nyquist rate. In this case is an identity matrix I where the value of any element along the diagonal line of the matrix is one and the value of any other element of the matrix is zero . This results in the digitized signal y x with N samples. However in the preferred embodiment sub Nyquist sampling process only M samples M

The plot from shows the original received waveform smooth curve and the sub Nyquist samples diamond sample dots at the output of the ADC subsystem . Only 10 of the original samples from the smooth waveform are measured. It is obvious that much of the original information from the received waveform is lost. Without any additional information the best conventional approach to reconstruct the signal is to use some types of interpolation techniques. show the reconstructed waveforms red curves using the conventional linear and spline interpolation techniques respectively. It is obvious from that these conventional techniques fail to reconstruct the original waveform.

While sampling process is simply a random linear projection the reconstruction process is highly non linear it attempts to find the sparsest signal from the received measurements. More precisely the reconstruction algorithm is to solve the following sparsity driven inverse problem min 4A and the original signal can be recovered as x . Under some mild assumptions the compressed sensing theory asserts that x can be faithfully recovered from M O K log N measurements with very high success probability by solving the following optimization problem. min subject to Equation 1A The optimization problem above is however an NP hard problem and is computationally very expensive to solve. The Compressed Sensing CS theory addresses that under some mild conditions on sensing matrix the l norm minimization problem L norm is simply its number of significant non zero elements can be efficiently solved by recasting it as the following l norm convex optimization. min such that 4A and the original signal can be recovered as x . The CS framework asserts that x can be faithfully recovered from only M O K log N measurements y suggesting a potential of significant cost reduction in data acquisition. The optimization problem above is however an NP hard problem and is computationally very expensive to solve. The CS theory addresses that under some mild conditions on sensing matrix the l norm minimization problem can be efficiently solved by recasting it as the following l norm convex optimization min 5A Again under some mild conditions of the sensing matrix the reconstructed signal x via the equation y x which can be roughly regarded as the sparsest or most compressible solution from many candidate solutions of the under determined equation in Equation 1A. In order to faithfully recover the input signal from a few compressed measurements the sensing matrix needs to be incoherent with the sparsifying matrix . In other words the product matrix A is required to have good Restricted Isometry Property RIP i.e. for all vectors and for all subset of K T columns of the matrix A denoted as A yields 1 1 where is some constant 0

The problem consists of designing a a stable measurement matrix such that the salient information in any K sparse or compressible signal is not damaged by the dimensionality reduction and b a robust reconstruction algorithm to recover the sparse signal x from the measurements y.

From a sensing point of view a direct straightforward implementation of the series of incoherent linear projections in y x 3A does not immediately lead to sub Nyquist sampling since a very fast analog digital converter ADC is still needed to capture the digital samples in the vector x in the first place. Furthermore since the randomly generated dense linear operator has no structure there does not exist fast algorithms and efficient implementations for it. Sparser and more deterministic sensing operators with fast implementations such as structurally random matrices described in Thong T. Do Trac D. Tran and Lu Gan Fast compressive sampling using structurally random matrices Proc. of 2008 Las Vegas April 2008 hereby incorporated by reference can retain the high performances of random matrices while yielding much lower computational cost. Nevertheless they still depend on highly accurate digital samples at very fine resolution from the original signal of interest. To realize the true compressed sensing advantage one has to collect SAR data via analog components with a slower sampling clock. Such technique requires significant modifications to the current ARL UWB SAR system s hardware. It is more desirable to minimize the level of software hardware upgrades while applying the Compressed. Sensing CS concepts to improve reconstruction image quality while achieving sub Nyquist sampling rate.

From a recovery point of view in the vector space H Cof N dimensional signals vector x can be represented as x where is called the sparsifying matrix which in other words the representation through can be and in many cases should be redundant. The sparsifying matrix is said to be complete if its columns span the entire N dimensional space. The signal x is said to be strictly K sparse when there are only K non zero components in . When the sorted magnitudes of decay very quickly and x can be well approximated with only K components then x is said to be K compressible. Needless to say the effectiveness of the recovery algorithm of a class of signal x heavily depends on the sparsest representation of the signal class.

In standard compressed sensing fixed linear transform bases such as the DCT FFT and the discrete wavelet transform DWT or a combination of all three are often employed to obtain sparsity. In the UWB SAR system the transmitted pulse is a monocycle impulse with an approximated bandwidth range of 300 3000 MHz. Current collected raw data captured in the 8 receivers do not exhibit any common sparse pattern. In other words a quick spectrum analysis reveals that our raw data is not time Sparse or frequency sparse or even wavelet sparse. Hence a na ve direct application of Compressed Sensing CS via random projection with Fourier cosine or wavelet bases yields disappointing results.

Signals might not always have the sparsest representation in a conventional signal independent basis found in transform coding. In the case of compressed sensing since one does not have to communicate the sparsifying transform from the encoder to the decoder an over complete dictionary of previously observed signals or other signal dependent atoms can be a powerful choice. Here the dictionary is a collection of J N vectors k 1 k J. Alternatively a dictionary can be seen as a fat N J matrix . For a given signal y C the sparse representation problem consists of finding a representation x where Cis a sparse vector i.e. with fewest significant large coefficients and or most of its coefficients having small negligible magnitudes.

In a preferred embodiment approach the dictionary is constructed from time shifted versions of the transmitted probing signal s t . Define i j with 1 i I 1 j J as the pixel location of a reflective target in the recovery area. The received signal x t is simply the summation of reflections of all targets within the recovery area i.e. the received signal is composed of a linear combination of delayed and weighted replicas of the transmitted pulse s t as follows 

From equation 3D the coefficients can be computed from the measurements in x which is over sampled. However since the receiver only measures y which the sub Nyquist version of x as described in Equation 1D one needs to construct a corresponding sub Nyquist version S from the dictionary S. The following equation is presented 4 where Sis the icolumn of S while S is the icolumn of S. Thus S is a K N matrix that composes of the time shifted versions of the transmitted waveform similar to the formation of S. However each of the time shifted columns S in S is sampled at the sub Nyquist rate using the same matrix in the sensing stage that is employed to capture the received waveform. Once the sub Nyquist dictionary is constructed one can attempt to recover the coefficient vector from the measurement vector y via solving the following inverse problem

There are two classes of available techniques for solving the inverse linear system of equations for the sparsest in the compressed sensing community.

In this implementation the orthogonal matching pursuit technique was employed as described in D. Needell and R. Vcrshynin Signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements via regularized orthogonal matching pursuit 4 pp. 310 316 April 2010 hereby incorporated by reference to solve for a due to its simplicity recovery robustness and fast computation. Once the coefficients are computed the signal waveform x can be reconstructed using Equation 3D .

In this approach we construct the sparsifying dictionary from time shifted versions of the transmitted probing signal s t . Define i j with 1 i I 1 j J as the pixel location of a reflective target in the recovery area. The received signal x t is simply the summation of reflections of all targets within the recovery area i.e. the received signal is composed of a linear combination of delayed and weighted replicas of the transmitted pulse s t as follows 11 6 where the weighting coefficients represent signal attenuation and phase changes caused by different travel distances and reflection angles. In other words the received signal x t is simply the output of an LTI system modeled by the reflection coefficients and its sparsity is directly related to the complexity level of the scene. Suppose that the received signal is sampled at the Nyquist rate the collected digitized data record x can be represented as 7 where N l column vector x is a length N record N I J matrix S is the redundant matrix whose columns are time shifted version of the transmitted signal s t and I J l column vector is the sparse vector of weighting coefficients. Significant coefficients in indicates the existence of such objects. The position and magnitude value of significant coefficients in reveals the potential position and shape information of significant targets. One can hypothesize that the record x is sparse in the dictionary S in the sense that there should only exist a few significant coefficients in which corresponds to the significant targets or objects within that local neighborhood. Hence the compressive sensing problem in this case involves the solving of the following lor loptimization problem min 0 1 such that 8 

Two sensing schemes are now explored a random projection and b random sub sampling with a slower analog digital converter ADC clock rate. In the former case the sensing matrix in 8 above is chosen as a completely random matrix of Gaussian i.i.d entries and a series of dot products over the entire signal support are performed to yield the CS measurements y. In the latter case samples are randomly selected of x as measurements y. Therefore the sensing matrix in this case is simply an identity matrix with randomly deleted rows.

Numerous recovery techniques in the current Compressed Sensing CS literature can be employed to solve the optimization problem in Equation 6 . In a preferred embodiment Orthogonal Matching Pursuit OMP was chosen due to its simplicity recovery robustness and fast computation. OMP is also very simple to set up the only required parameter is the sparsity level K. Once the sparsest coefficient vector is found the raw data record is recovered as in Equation 7 . All of the recovered data records are then supplied to the back projection image formation algorithm to produce the final SAR image.

An extension of Matching Pursuit MP is its orthogonal version Orthogonal Matching Pursuit OMP . The main difference with MP is that coefficients are the orthogonal projection of the signal on the dictionary D. In fact this algorithm solves the sparse problem 

In this section the results are shown using the simulated data. shows the imaging geometry. In this data set the radar is configured in side looking mode. It travels in the horizontal direction transmits impulses to the imaging area and receives backscattered radar signals from the targets. In this scene there are fifteen point targets that are arranged in three rows and five columns. Using the backprojection SAR image formation SAR imagery is formed from radar collected along the synthetic aperture. shows the SAR image for this simulation scenario. This SAR image is served as the baseline image for performance comparison purpose since the received radar data is sampled well above the Nyquist rate.

Next a sub Nyquist sampling case will be described. shows an original radar record smooth curve that is sampled well under the required Nyquist sampling rate. The signal is randomly digitized at approximately 5 the original sampling rate. In only 20 samples shown by the diamonds out of 200 original samples are digitized and recorded. Obviously it is not possible to reconstruct the signal using conventional techniques. shows the reconstructed waveform red curve vs. the original waveform blue curve using the linear interpolation technique. shows the reconstructed waveform red curve vs. the original waveform blue curve using the higher order spline interpolation technique. The classic interpolation techniques completely fail to reconstruct the signal since it is sampled at well above the Nyquist rate. shows the reconstructed waveform red curve vs. the original waveform blue curve using our proposed model based sub Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique. Although the reconstruction is not perfect it performs much better than the classic interpolation techniques. The reconstruction preserves the structure and follows most of the peaks and valleys of the original waveform.

Also desirable is a comparison of the reconstruction performance in the SAR image domain. and show the three SAR images formed using the reconstructed data from the spline interpolation linear interpolation and the SMB based reconstruction techniques respectively. From the SAR images of using the interpolation techniques the images are so noisy that we cannot resolve any target. Although the SAR image from using the SMB technique sub Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique shows the higher sidelobe level than that of the baseline SAR image of all 15 targets can be easily resolved. In the same SAR image of is displayed in reduced dynamic range 15 dB instead of 40 dB shows that all targets can be detected without any false alarm.

Algorithms are tested and compared using the data from the ARL UWB low frequency forward looking SAR radar. The system is a time domain impulse based radar that transmits narrow pulses that occupy the frequency spectrum from 300 MHz to 3000 MHz. The radar has two transmitters and an array of 16 receivers to form a physical aperture in the forward looking mode The radar range swath is from 8 to 33 m. In depth detail of the radar system is discussed in Ressler Marc et al. The Army Research Laboratory ARL Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction SIRE Forward Looking Radar Proceedings of SPIE Unmanned Systems Technology IX Vol. 6561 May 2007 hereby incorporated by reference. After the return radar signals are captured and digitized by the receivers a series of signal processing algorithms are performed on the data to mitigate noise and other artifacts. The processed data are then sent to the image formation algorithm to form 2D SAR imagery. ARL has developed the RSM technique as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 796 829 hereby incorporated by reference that integrates with the standard backprojection image formation to achieve significant sidelobe and noise reduction in SAR imagery. The ARL report Lam Nguyen Signal and image processing algorithms for the U.S Army Research Laboratory ultra wideband UWB synchronous impulse reconstruction SIRE radar Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL TR 4784 April 2009 hereby incorporated by reference describes all the signal processing and image formation algorithms employed to produce SAR imagery.

There are nine small test targets in the center of the scene and other large man made and natural clutter objects along both sides. This is the best quality image that can be generated using 100 of over sampled data with the signal and image formation techniques.

Next the under sampled data set 1.544 Giga samples sec is considered by re sampling the raw radar data at 20 of the original sampling rate which is well under the Nyquist rate. Using the standard interpolation technique for waveform reconstruction the SAR image is formed from the under sampled data set. shows the corresponding SAR image which has very poor quality. The SAR image is very noisy none of the targets can be detected.

Finally the reconstruction of the under sampled data set 1.544 Giga samples sec is examined using the proposed SMB technique. The SMB reconstruction technique is then applied to the sub Nyquist sampling data records and the SAR image is formed via time domain back projection as usual. In other words our technique recovers the raw radar data directly before passing them over to the image formation process. The SMB reconstruction technique described above requires a dictionary that is formed using the time shifted waveforms of the received signal from a point target. Since this basis waveform the actual transmit waveform filtered by the system transfer function is not available this waveform is estimated by generating an analytical wideband signal that covers the same frequency spectrum of the radar transmit pulse. This analytical wideband waveform is employed in the dictionary S for the reconstruction of the real radar data. Surprisingly the reconstruction for the real radar data works quite well even with the analytical time delayed dictionary. The performance is expected to be even superior if the real response from a point target is measured and employed in the dictionary construction.

In depth detail of the signal processing and image formation of the SIRE radar system is discussed in Lam Nguyen Signal and Image Processing. Algorithms for the Army Research Lab Ultra Wideband Synchronous Impulse Reconstruction UWB SIRE Radar ARL Technical Report ARL TR 4784 April 2009 hereby incorporated by reference. The SAR image shows the road the dark area in the middle of the image where the radar travels along and the bushes and other man made and natural clutter objects along both sides of the road. For this study although the radar data was sampled and collected at above the Nyquist rate using the SIRE data acquisition technique the original radar records were re sampled using the random sub sampling technique. The model based sparse sampling reconstruction technique is then applied to the sub sampling data records and the SAR image is formed. The model based sparse reconstruction technique described above requires a dictionary that is formed using the time shifted waveforms of the received signal from a point target. Since this basis waveform is not available the analytical wideband waveform was employed that is used in simulation data for the reconstruction of the real radar data. Surprisingly the reconstruction for the real radar data works quite well even with the analytical basis waveform. shows a segment of a down range radar data record reconstructed using the model based sparse sampling reconstruction technique with 20 of the original samples. The reconstruction performs well in this case. The SAR image of is formed using the reconstructed down range data with 20 of the original data samples. Compare this to the original baseline image of note that while the sidelobe level is slightly higher in the reconstructed SAR image the target signatures in both images are very similar in both shapes and amplitudes. Even small radar cross section RCS targets shows up well in the reconstructed SAR image.

Although the emerging Compressed Sensing CS theory offers a new approach in data acquisition and offers the data compression feature it still does not address the drawback that data acquisition must be operated in equivalent time since many measurements or projections are required as depicted by the sensing matrix in the CS framework. In the foregoing the model based sub Nyquist sampling and reconstruction technique that allows us to sample and reconstruct wide bandwidth radar signals in real time not equivalent time with the sampling rate that is well below the required Nyquist rate. The results showed that the reconstruction technique performs well while the conventional interpolation methods completely failed. The reconstruction for the real radar data works well even with the analytical basis waveform.

Returning to sparcity problem let x be a signal of length N it is said to be K sparse if x only has K

Two issues that often arise in practice are i the space that signal sampling is carried out is often not necessarily sparse the signal of interest x is most likely sparse in another domain and ii measurements are often contaminated by a certain level of noise say of variance . To address both of these issues one can attempt to solve the following optimization problem instead min subject to Equation 3B where the operator can be thought of as the sparsifying transform or frame or dictionary for x here can be chosen as a concatenation of a long list of popular fixed linear transforms such as Fourier cosine Gabor and wavelet . This is commonly referred to as analysis based CS in the literature as described further in S. Becker et al. NESTA a Fast and Accurate First order Method for Sparse Recovery 4 1 39 2011 hereby incorporated by reference. For the present application and SAR data set utilizing NESTA and selecting the Fourier transform as and the sensing matrix as a random matrix whose entries being i.i.d. random variables generated from a Gaussian distribution offers the best and most robust recovery performance that CS can offer.

From a practical sensing point of view the aforementioned random Gaussian matrix that performs random projections does not immediately lead to lower cost slower clock data acquisition unless it is implemented directly in the analog domain as an analog operator. While there have been numerous efforts in the CS hardware design it is believed that CS based A D converters only exist in research labs. To realize true sub Nyquist under sampling a radically different approach is taken in relying on currently available off the shelf inexpensive A D converters with a slower sampling clock to capture SAR data. Therefore a proposed technique only requires minor modifications to the current ARL UWB SAR system s hardware. To recover raw SAR data records at high rates instead of relying on the traditional approach of interpolation or the recent CS approach with a certain sparsifying transform a sparsity driven optimization approach is chosen based on an appropriate physical model each radar data record is modeled as a superposition of many backscattered signals from reflective point targets in the scene.

Using this approach by hypothesis the optimal sparsifying redundant frame for the receiving SAR signal x t is the over complete dictionary consisting of numerous time shifted versions of the transmitted probing signal s t . More specifically the received signal x t is modeled as the summation of all reflections from all targets within the recovery area. The received signal is reconstructed or derived from a linear combination of delayed and weighted replicas of the transmitted pulse s t as follows Equation 6B where weighting coefficients represent signal attenuation and time shift parameters Tmodel phase changes caused by different physical material properties travel distances and reflection angles in the returned signal. In the discrete setting suppose that the received signal x is already sampled at the Nyquist rate then x can be compactly represented as Equation 7B where the N l column vectors is the signal of interest the N I matrix S is the redundant dictionary whose I columns are timeshified version of the transmitted signal s t and the I l column vector is the sparse vector of weighting coefficients. Significant elements in indicate the existence of significant object s in the scene. The position and magnitude value of significant coefficients in a reveal the potential position and shape information of those significant targets. The record x is sparse in the dictionary S in the sense that few significant coefficients in a correspond to significant targets or objects within that local neighborhood. Hence the sparse recovery problem in this case involves solving the following loptimization problem min subject to Equation 8B 

Here the sparsity level K in the sparse recovery process is directly related to the complexity level of the scene. If K is kept fixed throughout all data records then one is only interested in at most K significant point targets in any particular scene. Numerous recovery techniques in the current CS literature can be employed to solve the optimization problem in Equation 8B including the lrelaxation approaches. The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit OMP may be chosen due to its simplicity recovery robustness and fast computation. OMP is a very simple to set up the only required parameter is the sparsity level K. Once the sparsest coefficient vector is found the raw data record is recovered as in Equation 7B . All of the recovered data records are then supplied to the time domain back projection image formation algorithm to produce the final SAR image.

Operative sensing schemes include i random Gaussian projection which has been proven to offer the best recovery performance for traditional CS and ii uniform sub sampling with a much slower ADC clock rate. In the former case elements of the sensing matrix are chosen as independent and identically distributed i.i.d. Gaussian random variables. In the latter case the sensing matrix is chosen as Iwhere T kM k Z and M is the sub sampling factor. This simply yields uniform regular under sampled which can be easily accomplished with an inexpensive ADC. For signal recovery three options are explored i analysis CS recovery via NESTA as described in S. Becker et al.

The over sampled data are also used by the Gaussian projection compressed sensing scheme. In this case the data reconstruction is based on a few measured projected samples which make up 20 of the original data samples. It is important to note here that although this compressed sensing data acquisition scheme results in data bandwidth reduction reconstruction is based on the number of projected samples rather than the original data samples the Gaussian projection still requires that each data record is digitized at the original over sampled rate 7.720 Giga samples sec . shows the SAR image using the standard compressed sensing framework. From although a few targets are detectable with very high false alarm rate the overall SAR image quality is very poor

Next the under sampled data set 1.544 Giga samples sec is considered which is well under the Nyquist rate. Using the standard interpolation technique for waveform reconstruction the SAR image is formed from the under sampled data set. shows the corresponding SAR image which has very poor quality. The SAR image is very noisy none of the targets can be detected.

Finally the reconstruction of the under sampled data set was tested using the proposed SMB technique. The reconstruction method performed quite well in this case. Since the probing waveform the actual transmitted waveform filtered by the overall system transfer function is not available this waveform was estimated by generating an analytical wideband signal that covers the same frequency spectrum of the radar transmit pulse. shows the SAR image reconstruction using the SMB technique. The reconstruction performs very well. All nine small targets are reconstructed with high fidelity. The SAR background noise level is comparable to the original over sampled data as shown in . There are some small isolated areas where the noise speckles are slightly higher than the original image. Overall the SAR image reconstruction using the proposed technique achieved excellent performance in this real and challenging scenario using under sampled data 20 .

In summary the preferred embodiments comprise a novel robust sparse recovery technique that allows the sub Nyquist uniform under sampling of wide bandwidth radar data in real lime single observation . Although much of the information is lost in the received signal due to the low sampling rate a robust signal recovery is obtained via modeling the received radar waveform as a superposition of many backscattered signals from reflective point targets in the scene. The proposed SMB technique is based on direct sparse recovery via OMP using a special dictionary containing many time delayed versions of the transmitted probing signal. The technique allows the use of existing commercial off the shelf COTS hardware and architecture. The algorithm was tested using real radar data from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory ARL Ultra Wideband UWB synthetic aperture radar SAR . The sparse recovery model based SMB technique successfully models and synthesizes the returned radar data from real scenes using a handful of coefficients and an analytical waveform that models the transmitted signal. SAR image quality from only 20 under sampled data is essentially the same as the quality obtained from the original over sampled data.

Possible uses of the invention include remote sensing applications such as target detection anomaly detection range detection imaging radar other remote sensors communication systems medical imaging systems natural resource management planning and monitoring. Using the concepts of the present invention lost information from sub Nyquist sampling may be recovered using sparsity modeling technique. The present invention allows the use of relatively inexpensive ADCs to capture wide bandwidth signals in real time not equivalent time . The preferred embodiment sampling technique affords data compression which facilitates reducing transmission bandwidth particularly for sensors or networks of sensors. The preferred embodiment SMB technique can be used to extrapolate information. Once the SMB can successfully model data based upon a fraction of available information sub Nyquist data it can further estimate and or synthesize other information that might otherwise not exist in the input data.

As used herein the terminology sparsity driven of sparsity driven is a relative term relating to the finding of a compressible solution which is intended to be treated broadly. For example a sparse matrix is a matrix with enough zeros that it pays to take advantage of them commonly interpreted from an economics view point in that if one can save time and memory by exploiting the zeros then a matrix is sparse. The terminology sparsity refers to the selection of a model within a hierarchy of model classes that yields a compact representation i.e. a model that depends on only a few of the observations selecting a small subset of features for classification or visualization. Selection of an optimal representation which is sufficiently sparse enables efficient computation by optimization techniques and alleviates the extreme difficulty encountered without sufficient sparsity.

As used herein the terminology target area means area of interest which may be for example a scene an animal or human body or portion thereof face as in face recognition object ground region field landscape aerial environment or a combination thereof.

The term noise as used herein relates to observation noise. There are many sources that cause noise in the resulting observed signal. Noise can be divided into two categories additive noise and multiplicative noise. System noise thermal noise quantization noise self interference noise radio frequency interference RFI noise are some examples of the additive noise. Multiplicative noise is much more difficult to deal with since it is data dependent. Some sources that cause multiplicative noise include timing jitter in data sampling small aperture size compared to image area the under sampling of aperture samples the non uniform spacing between aperture samples errors in position measurement system etc. Multiplicative noise results in undesired sidelobes that create high noise floor in the image and thus limit the ability to detect targets.
