This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 438 015 filed Jan. 31 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.

Subject matter described herein was made with U.S. Government support under Grant Number RO3NS070065 awarded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS of the National Institutes of Health NIH . The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.

Neurologic disorders result from the progressive loss of structure function and death of neurons in the specific regions of the brain and spinal cord. These conditions either cause problems with movements e.g. spinocerebellar ataxias Huntington and Parkinson s disease epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or affect memory e.g. Alzheimer s disease and major depression. Most of the recent research has focused on identifying mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration and therapeutic approaches primarily targeted to prevent neuronal loss or stimulate neurogenesis Abdipranoto 2008 . However therapies currently available have had limited success and marketed pharmaceuticals do not have dramatic benefits Abdipranoto 2008 . Described herein is an innovative therapeutic approach of targeting the central nervous system with therapeutic compounds and peptides of subjects suffering from the above mentioned neurodegenerative diseases.

Interaction between astrocytes and neurons are essential during development and for many critical functions in adult brain. Astrocytes the most prevalent cell type in brain express receptors for variety of growth factors and neurotransmitters and are actively involved with neurite growth and control of neuronal activities. Neurons on the other hand regulate astrocyte function. Studies show that astrocytic glia release the same trophic factors when activated under stress or during normal physiological conditions. There seems to be a delicate balance of events that may lead to the transition from neuroprotection to neurodegeneration Rojo et al 2007 . Glial cells that normally produce the neurotrophic factors required for neurogenesis or neuronal repair when activated by stressing events might overproduce those factors triggering the altered pathway to neurodegeneration. Recent evidences suggest that altered signaling patterns between the glia neuron interactions activate cellular events common to many neurodegenerative diseases Rojo et al 2007 .

Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common disorder of the brain often associated with neuronal loss and gliosis in the regions of the hippocampus Lewis 1999 .

Spinocerebellar ataxias SCAs are autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect the cerebellum and brain stem causing progressive ataxia motor impairment and eventual death. Most SCAs are caused by CAG repeat expansions. In SCA1 the expanded CAG repeat tract in ataxin 1 causes cerebellar Purkinje cells PCs to degenerate. The exact mechanism of PC degeneration in SCA1 is not fully understood. There is currently no effective pharmacologic treatment for SCA1 and other SCAs.

The development of therapeutic peptides has advanced rapidly because these molecules have such diverse activity and show great promise as targeted drugs. An inherent limitation of bioactive peptides however is their relative instability and the delivery of a therapeutic dose proves challenging. As the field of peptide therapy grows much attention is focused on peptide delivery using macromolecular carriers.

Macromolecular delivery systems are promising strategies to deliver drugs. Micro and nanospheres are being investigated for their ability to deliver bioactive peptides via the oral route stabilizing and delivering them through absorption barriers in the gastrointestinal tract. However nanoparticles do not offer the possibility of thermal targeting. Liposomes have emerged as a major class of macromolecular carriers for drug delivery. Liposome peptide conjugates have been investigated but a focus of this field is the conjugation of cell penetrating peptides to the surface of liposomes to enhance fusion with the cell membrane. The use of liposomes to deliver therapeutic peptides though promising has not been adequately researched.

To date liposomes and micro and nano particle based drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the drug e.g. chemotherapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors Allen 1998 Langer 1998 Torchilin 1998 Jones 1999 . Unlike free drugs that have faster plasma clearance and poor selectivity towards tumor cells macromolecular based drugs display improved pharmacokinetics and better tumor uptake due to enhanced permeability and retention EPR of the tumor vasculature Cassidy 1989 Maeda 1992 Takakura 1990 Yamaoka 1994 . Polymer delivered drugs also exhibit significantly lower systemic toxicity compared to free drug Duncan 1998 Seymour 1987 Yeung 1991 and studies have shown that water soluble polymer carriers can overcome multidrug resistance St astny 1999 Ryser 1978 Ohkawa 1993 Minko 1998 .

Thermosensitive liposomes are a technological innovation that employs lipid components with thermal sensitivity in the physiological temperature range. Upon application of hyperthermia the lipid membrane undergoes a phase transition and becomes more permeable thus releasing drug that has been loaded inside. This approach has been used successfully to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs such as methotrexate cisplatin doxorubicin and bleomycin to solid tumors in animals. However this approach requires diffusion of the drug out of the liposome under hyperthermic conditions and therefore limits delivery of small and relatively hydrophobic molecules. Therapeutic peptides are too large and hydrophilic to escape the liposomes even under elevated temperatures.

With recent improvement in the control of power density temperature distribution and treatment monitoring by magnetic resonance tomography which can characterize temperature as well as perfusion it is possible to heat only a limited and specific target area in a patient and minimize the effects of non specific toxicity. Consequently the methods and techniques necessary to employ thermal targeting of thermally sensitive polypeptides are available in the clinical setting.

Therefore as proposed herein are compositions and methods for thermally targeted delivery of therapeutic polypeptides to particular regions of the brain for treating conditions of interest.

In some embodiments the therapeutic compound can be selected from a therapeutic polypeptide TP a drug an antibiotics and a nucleotide molecule e.g. siRNA . In some embodiments the composition can be administered to a subject for delivery to a region of the brain or spinal cord to which local hyperthermia has been applied. In some embodiments the composition can be administered to a subject for delivery to the cerebellum to which local hyperthermia has been applied.

The earliest morphologic change seen in SCA1 Purkinje cells PCs is the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles rich in proteins that normally localized to Bergmann glia BG . These vacuoles are toxic as PC with vacuoles exhibit abnormal development of dendritic spines. The present inventors observed that the treatment of SCA1 transgenic Tg mice with the neurotrophic factor IGF I improves the SCA1 phenotype and the present inventors proposed peptide therapies for treatment for this disorder. Described herein are compositions and methods that can target SCA PCs using therapeutic peptides TPs that directly influence PC growth and signaling alter mutant ataxin 1 protein phosphorylation and or modulate PC Bergmann glia BG interactions.

Therapeutic Polypeptides TPs are promising because they can be designed to inhibit specific molecular interactions however their efficacy in vivo is limited by poor pharmacokinetic parameters. To improve their pharmacokinetics and bio distribution as described herein the present inventors have selected TPs and fused them to a thermal targeting polypeptide TTP . The resulting composition can be targeted to the cerebellum of a subject by applying local hyperthermia.

As used herein the term polypeptide means any polymer comprising any of the 20 protein amino acids regardless of its size. Although protein is often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides and peptide is often used in reference to small polypeptides usage of these terms in the art overlaps and varies. The term polypeptide as used herein refers to peptides polypeptides and proteins unless otherwise noted.

With regard to the thermal targeting polypeptide TTP of the composition as used herein TTP refers to a polypeptide that can preferentially direct the composition to the target cerebellum to which local hyperthermia has been applied. At a characteristic temperature called the transition temperature T the TTP hydrophobically collapses and aggregates. This property can be exploited for thermally targeted delivery of the TTP containing composition.

The composition of the presently disclosed subject matter can be administered e.g. intravenously IV intranasally IN intraperitoneally IP to a subject. In some embodiments when hyperthermia has not been applied to the target the composition will have a lower blood concentration and will be rapidly cleared under physiological conditions wherein TT than the composition will aggregate and accumulate at the heated site i.e. the target to which local hyperthermia has been applied.

Embodiments of the composition will pass the blood brain barrier BBB accumulate in cells PCs and can improve motor coordination and or cerebellar pathology in an animal e.g. subject SCA1 mouse model .

In some embodiments the TTP is an ELP having a T 40 42 C. In some embodiments the TTP is an ELP as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0255554 of A. Chilkoti which is incorporated herein by this reference together with all polypeptide sequences and information regarding ELPs as disclosed therein.

In some embodiments the compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter include a cell penetrating polypeptide. As used herein the term cell penetrating polypeptide CPP refers to a polypeptide that facilitates transport of the composition through a cell membrane or facilitates the delivery of the polypeptide across the blood brain barrier BBB . Cell penetrating peptides can be short polypeptides capable of mediating delivery of molecules across the plasma cell membrane. In some embodiments CPPs can be comprised of mostly basic amino acids hydrophobic amino acids or an amphipathic sequence. In some embodiments the CPP can be a TAT polypeptide from HIV 1 apegelin based peptide SynB1 a bactenecin derived Bac peptide or an Antennapedia derived penetratin peptide. The CPP can be selected for example to achieve a desired level of accumulation of the composition in the cerebellar tissue of a subject receiving the composition. Examples of CPPs that can be used in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter include but are not limited to those set forth in Table 1.

In some embodiments the composition further includes a carrier polypeptide CP . In some embodiments the CP can be disposed between the cell penetrating polypeptide CPP and the thermal targeting polypeptide TTP as follows CPP CP TTP TC. In some embodiments the CP can be provided between the TTP and the therapeutic compound as follows CPP TTP CP TC.

Without wishing to be bound by theory or mechanism to target Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and enhance peptide delivery it is contemplated that the carrier polypeptide could be selected to be a dopamine receptor polypeptide D2R . In some embodiments the carrier polypeptide could be an amino acid sequence taken from the IC3 loop region peptide sequences. Dempsey and Shaw Biochemistry 2011 50 9056 9065 . Without wishing to be bound by theory or mechanism S100B binding to the D2R is localized to the C terminus of the IC3 loop and is calcium independent binding contrast with TRTK binding to S100B which is calcium dependent .

Without wishing to be bound by theory or mechanism in some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter that include a carrier polypeptide the carrier polypeptide can target the composition to the targeting region. As such in some embodiments the TTP plus heat provides once source of targeting action while the carrier polypeptide can provide another source of targeting action.

Furthermore and without wishing to be bound by theory or mechanism in some embodiments the carrier polypeptide can provide a therapeutic benefit. For example in treating Parkinson disease an IC3 sequence as described herein can bind dopamine transporter DAT and and enhance presynaptic levels of dopamine by inhibiting dopamine binding to DAT. In addition within the cytosol an ELP IC3 component of embodiments of the composition can interact with transported DAT and inhibit DAT binding to dopamine receptors which could be useful in cases of dopamine receptor sensitization and regulation.

Examples of such carrier polypeptides which can be used in connection the presently disclosed subject matter can comprise the D2R polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NOS 36 40. In some embodiments the carrier polypeptide can be selected from a fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 40. In some embodiments the carrier polypeptide can comprise a fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 40 including 15 or more amino acids and extending from amino acid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 or 119 and extending to 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 and 129.

In some embodiments other appropriate amino acid sequences can be used for example the carrier polypeptide can comprise a fragment of any one of SEQ ID NOS 36 40 wherein the fragment begins with methionine asparagine or cystein and is about 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 or 58 amino acids in length.

In some embodiments the D2R polypeptides can be provided between the cell penetrating peptide and the thermal targeting polypeptide e.g. CPP D2R TTP TC . In some embodiments the D2R polypeptides can be provided between the thermal targeting polypeptide and the therapeutic compound e.g. CPP TTP D2R TC . Without wishing to be bound by theory or mechanism it has been shown that S100B interacts with D2R downregulates receptor activity and localizes to PC vacuoles but all that happens in the cytosolic side. The D2R polypeptides can bind to S100B extracellularly or at S100B release sites. It is contemplated that such embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter have the advantage of being able to deliver cargo to all other dopamine neurons e.g. SN in Parkinson s Disease.

As noted herein above in some embodiments of the composition the therapeutic compound is a therapeutic polypeptide TP . As used herein the term therapeutic polypeptide refers to a polypeptide capable of acting upon a target and affecting treatment of a neurodegenerative disease of interest. For example in some embodiments the therapeutic polypeptide is a polypeptide that is capable of influencing Purkinje cell PC growth and or signalling stimulating transcriptional activity of wildtype ataxin 1 inhibiting mutant ataxin 1 protein phosphorylation and or modulating Purkinje cell PC Bergmann glia BG interactions. In some embodiments the therapeutic polypeptide is known to be useful for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease but has limited utility for example due to poor bioavailability when administered alone. In this regard the presently disclosed subject matter can be used to salvage promising therapeutic polypeptides that were abandoned due to complications such as limited bioavailability upon administration.

As used herein the terms treatment or treating relate to any treatment of a neurodegenerative disease of interest e.g. spinocerebellar ataxias SCAs including but not limited to prophylactic treatment to prevent development or reduce severity of the disease. As such the terms treatment or treating include but are not limited to preventing a neurodegenerative disease of interest or the development of a neurodegenerative disease of interest inhibiting the progression of a neurodegenerative disease of interest arresting or preventing the development of a neurodegenerative disease of interest reducing the severity of a neurodegenerative disease of interest ameliorating or relieving symptoms associated with a neurodegenerative disease of interest and causing a regression of the neurodegenerative disease of interest or one or more of the symptoms associated with the neurodegenerative disease of interest.

A therapeutic polypeptide can be designed and or selected for efficacy e.g. a known efficacy. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art in some embodiments the selected therapeutic polypeptide TP can attached to the TTP. In some embodiments the composition can further include a CCP. For example as shown in an exemplary composition includes a CCP a TTP that is an ELP and a therapeutic polypeptide. In some embodiments the composition can further include a carrier polypeptide CP . In some embodiments multiple TPs can be selected for use in the presently disclosed composition.

Examples of TPs that can be used in the presently disclosed subject matter include but are not limited to IGF I which is a neurotrophic factor for PCs FGF7 which has receptors on BGs and enhances cell adhesion and signaling a PKA inhibitory polypeptide PKI which blocks PKA preventing its stabilization and nuclear accumulation a PKA substrate peptide which competes with mutant ataxin 1 preventing PKA stabilization and nuclear accumulation TRTK 12 a peptide which binds S100B and interferes with S100B binding to PC receptors and or induces vacuole formation R18 a 14 3 3 nonphospharylated inhibitor polypeptide a polypeptide having the sequence of an AXH domain of ataxin 1 or fragment thereof See the amino acid sequence disclosed in C. de Chiara C. Giannini S. Adinolfi J. de Boer S. Guida A. Ramos C. Jodice D. Kioussis A. Pastore The AXH molecule an independently folded domain common to ataxin 1 and HBP1. FEBS Letters Vol. 551 1 pp. 107 112 where are all incorporated herein by this reference and an ASIC inhibitory Psalmotoxin 1 polypeptide a cannabinoid receptor agonist polypeptide. Further examples of TPs that can be used in the presently disclosed subject matter include but are not limited to the polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS 29 35. In some embodiments the TP can have an amino acid sequence comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 32 or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments the TP can have an amino acid sequence comprising residues 7 126 of SEQ ID NO 32 or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments the TP can have an amino acid sequence comprising the amino acids of residues 750 689 of normal human ataxin 1 See de Chiara et al. FEBS Letters Vol. 551 1 pp. 107 112 .

In some embodiments the TP can be a fragment of Psalmotoxin 1. In some embodiments the TP can be a fragment of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 33. In some embodiments the fragment can be about 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 amino acids in length. In some embodiments the fragment can be about 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 or 39 amino acids in length.

In some embodiments the TP can be selected such that ataxin 1 is directly targeted. With reference to mutant ataxin 1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A PKA and stabilized by binding of the 14 3 3 protein to resist degradation. This leads to a toxic accumulation of ataxin 1 in the nuclei of for example SCA1 PCs.

SCA1 was used in this study as a neurodegenerative disease model. Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 SCA1 is a devastating neurological disorder resulting from CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 1 gene. The polyglutamine expanded mutant ataxin 1 primarily targets Purkinje cells PCs of the cerebellum. The exact mechanism of PC degeneration in SCA1 is poorly understood but it is known that the earliest morphologic change seen in SCA1 PCs is the development of cytoplasmic vacuoles that contain Bergmann glial BG proteins especially S100B. These vacuoles are toxic resulting in the abnormal development of dendritic spines. In addition vacuoles may form in response to a stress signal of PCs. Further S100B released by BG or from the vacuoles may modulate Akt phosphorylation of mutant ataxin 1. Akt is known to stabilize mutant ataxin 1 to aggregate in the nucleus of PCs.

An objective is to target SCA1 PCs with therapeutic peptides TPs that will directly influence ataxin 1 aggregation and toxicity. Though TPs are designed to inhibit specific molecular interactions their efficacy in vivo is limited by poor pharmacokinetic parameters. To improve their pharmacokinetics and bio distribution TPs will be fused to a thermally responsive polypeptide based carrier. This polypeptide can be targeted to the cerebellum of Tg mice by applying local hyperthermia. The amino acid sequence of the thermally responsive polypeptide is based on elastin like polypeptide ELP biopolymers which are soluble in aqueous solution below physiological temperature but aggregate when the temperature is raised above 41 C. A cell penetrating peptide CPP will be conjugated to the ELP to enhance delivery of the polypeptide across the blood brain barrier BBB and to facilitate cell entry. The TAT and SynB1 peptides will be used in this study To the CPP ELP two different TPs will be conjugated 1 a peptide which inhibits Akt activity by directly binding to the active site and 2 a peptide which binds and inhibits S100B. TPs will be administered intranasally IN and intravenously IV and by applying local hyperthermia it will be demonstrated that these polypeptides can be targeted to the cerebellum and improve motor coordination and cerebellar pathology in a SCA1 mouse model.

To investigate the role of S100B in SCA1 pathology a selective thermally responsive S100B inhibitory peptide was designed Synb1 ELP TRTK. The exemplary therapeutic polypeptide was developed using three key elements 1 an elastin like polypeptide ELP a thermal targeting polypeptide 2 TRTK12 peptide a known S100B inhibitory peptide and 3 a cell penetrating peptide Synb1 to enhance the intracellular delivery. Using fluorescent quenching techniques it was shown that the Synb1 ELP TRTK peptide has a similar S100B binding affinity as compared to the TRTK12 peptide alone. In addition in vitro studies revealed that Synb1 ELP TRTK treatment reduces S100B uptake in SHSY5Y cells. Further to deliver therapeutic peptides to the SCA1 cerebellum mice were treated with fluorescent labeled Synb1 ELP and it was observed that the labeled polypeptide can be localized to the cerebellum by IP injection. Overall these data show that thermal targeting of Synb1 ELP TRTK to the cerebellum to reduce S100B neurotoxicity.

Innovative non invasive procedure of inducing hyperthermia in different regions of the brain. An embodiment of the method disclosed herein was conducted using the Laser Head of Mettler Laser System 540 Mettler Electronics Anaheim Calif. USA . The Mettler 540 Laser System and the Mettler 540 Laser Applicator is a safe light heat therapy device currently used in clinics on humans. This Laser device has a Wavelength of 785 nm with a Power of 80 mW. Elliptical beam spot is 2.8 mm 1.1 mm elliptical beam area of 9.2 mm at the laser head aperture. Eye protection is recommended e.g. Uvex glasses with a minimum of 80 attenuation in the wavelength range of 780 nm to 860 nm that were supplied with the Mettler 540 system . General anesthesia techniques isoflurane or ketamine are used to anethesize the animals. Next the animals have their hair gently removed from the back of the head just above the cerebellum . Then the cerebellum is heated to a temperature no higher than 40 C. using the Mettler 540 Laser Applicator. The goal is to heat the cerebellum for three heating cycles maintaining a temperature range from 39 40 C. for 20 minutes during each cycle. Between each heating cycle there is 10 minute cooling period where the laser is turned off and the cerebellar temperature drops. This heating technique effectively accumulate the therapeutic ELP based peptides at the cerebellum. Similar procedure could be used to apply heat to the other brain and spinal cord regions. After the treatment the animal are allowed to recover from anesthesia.

With reference to a male 3 wk old FVB mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane. Then the animal s head was shaved to expose the scalp for proper light penetration. A small hole was punctured in the skull behind the right ear using a 25 gauge needle. Next a temperature sensitive probe was gently inserted midway into the cerebellum. Also a small hole was punctured in the skull just above the right frontal lobe and another temperature probe was gently inserted. The top of the head directly above the cerebellum was heated with a 8 mW 785 nm Mettler class 3B laser using a thermal cycling procedure of 30 minutes of heating followed by 5 minutes followed by two additional cycles of 20 minutes of heating and 5 minutes of cooling. The graph of shows the temperature of the cerebellum during Cooling Cycles in blue and Heating Cycles in red. Shown as the black dotted line is the body temperature taken with a rectal thermometer over the course of the 90 minute experiment. The Frontal Lobe temperature taken over the course of the 90 minute experiment is shown by the gray line. Interestingly over the thermal cycling procedure a cerebellum temperature greater than 39 C. was able to be reached during each heating cycle while maintaining a lower 2 degree difference in the frontal lobe temperature and the body temperature. This evidence supports the idea that the cerebellum can be thermally targeted for ELP delivery while limiting the thermal effect to other regions of the brain.

ELP based polypeptides are designed to be soluble at body temperature 37 C. and to aggregate and concentrate at a transition temperature between 39 42 C. Heating ELP fused peptides above 37 C. cause a transition in protein solubility which helped concentrate ELPs to a particular location in vivo. The biodistribution of Synb1 ELP GGC Synb1 ELP Gly Gly Cys in the brain heart spleen left panel lung kidney and liver right panel from control animals unheated animals and animals where the cerebellum was heated by thermal cycling were observed. It was found that heating the brain had no significant effect on Synb1 ELP GGC levels in the various organs analyzed. However there appears to be an increase in the total brain uptake in animals where the cerebellum was heated compared to unheated animals however the increase was not significant . The increase in brain uptake is most likely due to the enhanced localization of Synb1 ELP GGC to the cerebellum induced by the focused hyperthermia. The results are a unique finding as ELP peptide transport into the brain has never been studied. Overall it was found that thermal targeting by applying local focused hyperthermia significantly increased Synb1 ELP GGC localization to the cerebellum. This is the first evidence demonstrating that ELP based therapeutics can be thermally targeted to a particular region of the brain to combat neurodegenerative diseases as well as other CNS diseases. The ELP delivery system can be modified to accommodate a large repertoire of cargo including peptides drugs or DNA to treat a multitude of CNS diseases making a huge impact on the neurodegenerative field Bidwell and Raucher 2005 2009 Bidwell et al. 2007 Chen et al. 2008 MacKay et al. 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 .

To test if thermal cycling procedures causes brain injury changes in the level of damage associated proteins HSP70 NFkB and c Fos in 3 week old wildtype FVB mice were determined. These animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and their cerebella heated Heat or not heated No Heat . 24 hr post heating the animals were euthanized and their cerebellar tissue processed for Western blot analysis. It was found that heating the cerebellum with the laser system had no effect on the levels of HSP70 NFkB and c Fos which are protein markers for cellular stress apoptosis and brain damage respectively.

An intranasal IN route of administering compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter was studied. With reference to FVB two week old mice were anesthetized with ketamine and given 600 g of fluorescent labeled Synb1 ELP GGC by IN route the control peptide commonly used to monitor ELP localization and delivery in vivo. Displayed is the Radiant Efficiency of Synb1 ELP GGC uptake in the brain over time after IN dose where green is a high level of uptake red is a mid level and blue is a low level of uptake. With reference to the total Brain distribution of Synb1 ELP GGC fluorescence after IN dose of 240 600 and 740 g over time is shown n 3 mice per time point .

Plasma kinetics of compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter was studied. With reference to 3 week old FVB mice were anesthetized with ketamine and given 600 g of fluorescent labeled Synb1 ELP by intranasal route IN the control peptide commonly used to monitor ELP localization and delivery in vivo. At various time points organs and blood plasma were taken and measured. Shown in the Top graph is the Synb1 ELP kinetics in Brain Cerebellum Heart Lungs and Plasma. Shown is the Bottom graph is the Synb1 ELP kinetics of the Spleen Liver and Kidney.

The mutant ataxin 1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A PKA and stabilized by binding of the 14 3 3 protein to resist degradation. This leads to a toxic accumulation of ataxin 1 in the nuclei of SCA1 PCs. The over expressed mutant ataxin 1 makes nuclear inclusions both in cell culture and a mouse model. Therefore to decrease ataxin 1 toxicity another approach would be to target SCA1 PCs with therapeutic peptides TPs that will directly influence ataxin 1 phosphorylation stabilization and aggregation.

To the CPP ELP different therapeutic polypeptides are conjugated. To target PKA a PKA inhibitory peptide which binds to the active site and a substrate peptide that competes with ataxin 1 are designed. Further peptides which will interact with 14 3 3 and modulate its binding to mutant ataxin 1 are designed.

Administration can be achieved intranasally intravenously or intraperitoneally and the ability of these compositions to pass the BBB accumulate in Purkinje cells and improve motor coordination and cerebellar pathology in a SCA1 mouse model can be assessed.

Therapeutic polypeptides include 14 3 3 nonphosphorylated inhibitory peptide R18 FHCVPRDLSWLDLEANMCLP SEQ ID NO 29 with a 6 amino acid spacer sequence WPGSGG fused to R18 SEQ ID NO 41 and ELP e.g. Synb1 ELP WPGSGG R18 which interacts with 14 3 3 and probably modulates 14 3 3 binding to mutant ataxin 1 PKA Inhibitor 6 22 polypeptide TYADFIASGRTGRRNAI SEQ ID NO 30 NH with a 6 amino acid spacer sequence WPGSGG fused to PKI SEQ ID NO 41 and ELP e.g. Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 PKI which is a potent and competitive inhibitor of protein kinase A PKA having an amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 6 22 of human cAMP dependent protein kinase inhibitor alpha and is amidated at the C terminus and normal ataxin 1 polypeptide which will block mutant ataxin 1 mediated loss of D2R protein expression in a cell culture model.

To produce PKI and R18 ELP peptides DNA corresponding to PKI and R18 were cloned into Synb1 ELP vectors then check by DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed in XL1 Blue cells . To determine if the PKA and 14 3 3 inhibitory peptides can block mutant ataxin 1 aggregation in vitro the effects of Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 R18 and Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 PKI peptides on mutant ataxin 1 inclusion formation were observed. Data in demonstrates that both Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 R18 and Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 PKI peptides significantly reduce mutant ataxin 1 aggregation inclusion formation by inhibiting the PKA 14 3 3 ataxin 1 pathway in HEK cells expressing GFP ATXN1 82Q . In addition Western blot data revealed that Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 PKI treatment reduced ATXN1 S776 phosphorylation in HEK GFP ATXN1 82Q cells H89 a known PKA inhibitor was used as the positive control and . Taken together these data support efficacy of thermally targeting CCP ELPs to the cerebellum in an animal. These data further support the efficacy of blocking of PKA 14 3 3 ataxin 1 pathway in vitro by Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 R18 and Synb1 ELP WPGSGG SEQ ID NO 41 PKI.

Targeted Delivery of S100B Inhibitory Peptide to SCA1 Mouse Cerebellum. SCA1 PCs were targeted with a TP TRTK 12 that can directly interact with the BG S100B protein. A composition of the presently disclosed subject matter was prepared including TRTK 12 at the C terminus of a CPP ELP. With reference to it is shown that SynB1 ELP TRTK12 interacts strongly with S100B protein in vitro.

A minimum of five 2 wks old SCA1 mice were treated IP with vehicle saline ELP GGC or ELP TRTK peptides multiple times total 10 doses every other day for 3 wks. Some animals were subjected to hyperthermia. After completion of the treatments animals were subjected to behavioral tests.

Bar cross test. The bar crossing apparatus for testing balance and fine motor coordination consisted of a horizontal U shaped platform made of wood supported on 30 cm legs. The two parallel 30 cm long bars of the U were wide enough 18 mm for the mice to walk easily whereas the piece connecting them the challenge bar was also 30 cm long but only 2 mm wide. Animals were placed on one of the wide bars and allowed to move about on the apparatus for 5 min. After the spontaneous activity portion of the bar cross test animal were subjected to a forced task. In this task the mice were placed in the middle of the challenge bar in order to force a crossing attempt. A maximum of 120 sec was allowed for mice to stay on the bar and the latency to fall on a padded surface height 30 cm or cross Cross successfully was measured in seconds. The surface of the apparatus was cleaned with mild soap solution and air dried between mice. Animal performances on the bar cross apparatus were videotaped and later manually scored for the following spontaneous motor behaviors Vig et al 2011 Locomotion Time duration of motor activity Passivity duration of inactivity Slips frequency of animal having one or more legs unexpectedly slip off the wide bar Sniff Up frequency of pointing nose upward while making movements of nasal passages Sniff Down frequency of placing head below the platform while making movements of nasal passages Tests were performed on mice between 10 00 A.M. and 4 00 P.M. and were conducted only once after 3 weeks of TP or vehicle treatment and 4 days of rotarod test.

The bar cross test assessed the fine motor coordination and balance capabilities of vehicle or TP treated mice. SCA1 animals usually show hyperactivity and slip frequently with higher Sniff Up and down frequency as compared to age matched wildtype animals as reported earlier Vig et al 2011 . The CPP ELP TRTK treatments suppresses these activities as shown in .

IgG levels in plasma of mice treated withof SynB1 ELP GGC 100 mg kg and SynB1 ELP TRTK 100 mg kg were obtained. Mice were treated multiple times without induction of hyperthermia. IgG levels were measured using ELISA. Samples were diluted 1 50 000 and compared against a standard curve generated using a mouse IgG standard. The following data show that multiple ELP treatments do not induce a significant immune response in the mice.

S100B a glial secreted protein is believed to play a major role in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer s disease Down syndrome traumatic brain injury and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 SCA1 . SCA1 is a trinucleotide repeat disorder in which the expanded polyglutamine mutation in the protein ataxin 1 primarily targets Purkinje cells PCs of the cerebellum. Currently the exact mechanism of S100B mediated PC damage in SCA1 is not clear. However herein it is shown that S100B may act via the activation of the RAGE signaling pathway resulting in oxidative stress mediated injury to mutant ataxin 1 expressing neurons. To combat S100B mediated neurodegeneration a selective thermally responsive S100B inhibitory peptide Synb1 ELP TRTK was designed. The therapeutic polypeptide was developed using three key elements 1 the elastin like polypeptide ELP a thermally responsive polypeptide 2 the TRTK12 peptide a known S100B inhibitory peptide 3 a cell penetrating peptide Synb1 to enhance the intracellular delivery. Binding studies revealed that the peptide Synb1 ELP TRTK interacts with its molecular target S100B and maintains a high S100B binding affinity as comparable with the TRTK12 peptide alone. In addition in vitro studies revealed that Synb1 ELP TRTK treatment reduces S100B uptake in SHSY5Y cells. Furthermore the Synb1 ELP TRTK peptide decreased S100B induced oxidative damage to mutant ataxin 1 expressing neurons. To test the delivery capabilities of ELP based therapeutic peptides to the cerebellum mice were treated with fluorescently labeled Synb1 ELP and observed that thermal targeting enhanced peptide delivery to the cerebellum. The framework for thermal based therapeutic targeting to regions of the brain particularly the cerebellum is described here. Overall the data suggest that thermal targeting of ELP based therapeutic peptides to the cerebellum is a novel treatment strategy for cerebellar neurodegenerative disorders.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 SCA1 belongs to a group of CAG repeat neurodegenerative diseases. In SCA1 the expanded poly glutamine containing protein ataxin 1 causes progressive ataxia resulting from the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells PCs and neurons in the brainstem Koeppen 2005 Orr and Zoghbi 2007 Matilla Duenas et al. 2008 . Overexpression of the human mutant ataxin 1 gene in PCs of SCA1 transgenic Tg mice results in a phenotype very similar to SCA1 patients Burright et al. 1995 . In SCA1 Tg mice the earliest morphologic change is the appearance of cytoplasmic PC vacuoles containing the Bergmann glial BG protein S100B Skinner et al. 2001 Vig et al. 2006 Vig et al. 2009 . Recently it was reported that these PC vacuoles develop both in SCA1 Tg mice and SCA1 patients where the vacuolar formation is associated with abnormal PC morphology Skinner et al. 2001 Vig et al. 2006 Vig et al. 2009 . The S100B protein belongs to the EF hand family of calcium binding proteins and acts as a neurotrophic or neurotoxic signaling molecule for neighboring neurons Winningham Major et al. 1989 Donato 1991 Reeves et al. 1994 Barger et al. 1995 Whitaker Azmitia et al. 1997 Donato 1999 Huttunen et al. 2000 Donato 2001 Rothermundt et al. 2003 Zimmer et al. 2005 Donato et al. 2009 Sorci et al. 2010 . Many studies suggest that increased levels of S100B in the disease prone regions are a major causative factor for neurodegeneration in a variety of neurological disorders Griffin et al. 1989 Kato et al. 1990 Rothermundt et al. 2003 Vig et al. 2011 . S100B interacts with multiple protein targets including p53 nuclear Dbf2 related kinases receptor for advanced glycation end products RAGE protein kinase C neuromodulin and myo inositol monophosphatase 1 Donato 1999 McClintock and Shaw 2000 Wilder et al. 2006 Vig et al. 2009 . S100B is also a known RAGE ligand and stimulation of S100B RAGE signaling increases the production of reactive oxygen species ROS causing oxidative damage to neurons Adami et al. 2004 Donato et al. 2009 Sorci et al. 2010 . Currently it is not clear how S100B mediates the SCA1 pathology however herein a neuro damaging role for S100B is defined along an oxidative damage pathway in the SCA1 disease. To combat the neuro damaging effects of S100B in the SCA1 pathology a therapeutic polypeptide wasusing three key elements 1 the elastin like polypeptide ELP a thermally responsive polypeptide 2 the TRTK12 peptide a known S100B inhibitory peptide 3 a cell penetrating peptide Synb1 to enhance intracellular deliver. ELP is a thermally responsive polypeptide derived from mammalian elastin and is composed of multiple Val Pro Gly X Gly pentapeptide repeats where X is any amino acid except proline Li et al. 2001 Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2007 Dreher et al. 2007 Bidwell and Raucher 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 . ELP based polypeptides are designed to be soluble at temperatures below 38 C. and to aggregate and concentrate at a transition temperature between 39 42 C. Li et al. 2001 Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2007 Dreher et al. 2007 Bidwell and Raucher 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 . The ELP based delivery mechanism works by active thermal targeting using externally focused hyperthermia directed at tissues with a large vasculature structure such as cancerous tumors Dreher et al. 2007 . The Synb1 peptide is derived from naturally occurring protegrin peptides and mediates the delivery of peptides or compounds across the blood brain barrier Rousselle et al. 2000 Sarantseva et al. 2009 . On the C terminus the therapeutic peptide is fused to the S100B inhibitory peptide TRTK12. The peptide TRTK12 has been shown to have a high binding affinity for S100B with the capability to block S100B interaction with S100B target proteins Ivanenkov et al. 1995 Bianchi et al. 1996 McClintock and Shaw 2000 Frizzo et al. 2004 Charpentier et al. 2010 . Previously it was shown that the TRTK12 peptide is therapeutic to SCA1 mice where animals given TRTK12 displayed a significant improvement in ataxic behavior Vig et al. 2011 . Herein it is demonstrated that the ELP based technology can thermally target therapeutics to areas of the brain e.g. cerebellum to combat multiple CNS disorders especially the cerebellar ataxias.

ELP was modified by addition of the Synb1 peptide RGGRLSYSRRRFSTSTGR SEQ ID NO 11 and TRTK12 peptide TRTKIDWNKILS SEQ ID NO 31 or GGC peptide to produce Synb1 ELP TRTK or Synb1 ELP GGC by molecular cloning in a pET25b expression vector by recursive directional ligation and selected by ampicillin resistance as previously described Meyer and Chilkoti 1999 . Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. CPP ELP GGC polypeptides are commonly used as CPP ELP control peptides Massodi et al. 2009 Moktan et al. 2010 where GGC stands for the last three amino acids glycine glycine and cysteine of the CPP ELP also CPP ELP GGC polypeptides are commonly labeled on the C terminal cysteine residue with a fluorescent dye to monitor the impact of the CPP on fluorescent ELP localization in cell culture Massodi et al. 2009 Moktan et al. 2010 . ELP constructs were expressed using the pET25 expression system and purified by inverse transition cycling as described previously Meyer and Chilkoti 1999 Bidwell and Raucher 2005 . A turbidity assay was used to determine the transition temperature Tt where concentrations of Synb1 ELP TRTK and Synb1 ELP GGC from 5 M to 40 M were placed in DMEM media containing 10 fetal bovine serum as described previously Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2010 . The polypeptide solutions were heated at a rate of 1 C. min in a multi cell holder in a UV VIS spectrophotometer Cary 100 Varian instrument .

S100B was titrated from 100 nM up to 3.0 M into the various peptide solutions and changes in tryptophan fluorescence were recorded into an Excel file and graphs produced. A Fluorescence was plotted against free S100B concentration using GraphPad Prism software. A Fluorescence was calculated as follows Maximum fluorescence Observed fluorescence Maximum fluorescence Minimum Fluorescence 100 . Where the maximum fluorescence is the fluorescence of 5.0 M Synb1 ELP TRTK or 5.0 M TRTK12 before titration of S100B and the minimum fluorescence is the fluorescence of 5.0 M Synb1 ELP TRTK or 5.0 M TRTK12 fully saturated with bound S100B. GraphPad Prism software was used to calculate Kd and Rvalues for the binding studies.

Wild type WT FVB mice were obtained from Jackson Labs Bar Harbor Me. USA. All animal protocols were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The 3 week old animals were anesthetized with isoflurane Butler Animal Health Supply Dublin Ohio USA and a temperature probe was gently inserted into the cerebellum and the frontal lobe to monitor temperature changes under the thermal cycling procedure.

Peptide based drugs are gaining popularity as promising new therapeutics due to the ease of peptide design and the high specificity of peptides for their molecular targets Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2007 Dreher et al. 2007 Bidwell and Raucher 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 Bidwell and Raucher 2010 . In this study an S100B inhibitory polypeptide Synb1 ELP TRTK was designed. The therapeutic peptide was designed to take advantage of the unique properties of each of its three fused peptides 1 the ELP a thermally responsive polypeptide 2 the TRTK12 peptide a known S100B inhibitory peptide 3 a cell penetrating peptide Synb1 to enhance intracellular delivery . In previous studies the delivery of ELP conjugated therapeutic peptides has been successfully demonstrated Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2007 Dreher et al. 2007 Bidwell and Raucher 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 Bidwell and Raucher 2010 . The ELP thermally responsive element allows for simple peptide purification by inverse transition cycling where ELP conjugated polypeptides aggregate and precipitate at a transition temperature between 39 to 42 C. Li et al. 2001 Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2007 Dreher et al. 2007 Bidwell and Raucher 2009 MacKay et al. 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 Bidwell and Raucher 2010 . Taking advantage of the ELP thermal responsive element of the therapeutic peptide the first thermal pull down assay to test the interaction between Synb1 ELP TRTK and the S100B protein was developed . It was found that when precipitated by thermal cycling Synb1 ELP TRTK bound both S100B monomers and dimers . The dimeric S100B protein has been previously shown not to disassociate under standard SDS PAGE conditions Donato 1999 . However the control peptide Synb1 ELP GGC which lacks the TRTK12 peptide showed little to no interaction with the S100B protein . These data suggest that the therapeutic peptide Synb1 ELP TRTK directly interacts with its molecular target the S100B protein. Furthermore the pull down technique can be used as an alternative to standard pull down assays using Pro A or Pro G beads or further modified by the addition of ELP to accommodate other proteins of interest.

Alterations in the binding affinity of a peptide due to its fusion to ELP have never been studied previously. Since the therapeutic peptide Synb1 ELP TRTK interacted with the S100B protein using fluorescent spectroscopic techniques it was further investigated whether the binding affinity of Synb1 ELP TRTK for S100B differed from that of the native TRTK12. Fluorescent spectroscopy is a sensitive tool used to monitor changes in the local environment of tryptophan residues that occur during a protein ligand binding event furthermore changes in tryptophan fluorescence can be used to calculate binding affinity Weljie and Vogel 2000 Bocedi et al. 2004 . Previous work has shown that S100B binding reduces tryptophan fluorescence of TRTK12 and like peptides Ivanenkov et al. 1995 . The tryptophan fluorescence of 5.0 M Synb1 ELP TRTK and 5.0 M Synb1 ELP GGC were measured using a fluorescent spectrophotometer with an Excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an Emission wavelength of 350 nm in 25 mM TrisHCL and 0.1 mM CaClat 12 C. At 295 nm tryptophan emission spectrum is dominant over the weaker tyrosine and phenylalanine fluorescence Vivian and Callis 2001 . Synb1 ELP TRTK contains two tryptophan residues W755 and W767 while Synb1 ELP GGC contains only one tryptophan residue W755 . W755 has very little fluorescence at 350 nm which may be due to the 150 neighboring VPGXG repeats of ELP . In Synb1 ELP TRTK W767 the major binding residue of the S100B binding peptide TRTK12 in combination with W755 shows a large fluorescence emission at 350 nm . A decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of Synb1 ELP TRTK was observed upon addition of S100B from 100 nM to 3.0 M . This may be due to changes induced by the S100B interaction leading to less exposure of the tryptophan residues to the solvent solution and burial of W767 into the hydrophobic S100B binding site. S100B is a dimeric protein with two TRTK12 binding sites where the binding is calcium dependent Zimmer and Weber 2010 . Titration of S100B into a solution containing 25 mM TrisHCL 0.1 mM CaCland 1 mM EGTA displayed no effect in quenching the tryptophan fluorescence of Synb1 ELP TRTK at 350 nm . Fluorescent quenching can be used to study protein ligand binding when the formation of the protein ligand complex leads to a change in fluorescence of the complex Weljie and Vogel 2000 Bocedi et al. 2004 . Using this fluorescence quenching technique it is assumed that protein ligand complex formation is relative to the change in fluorescence. Therefore Synb1 ELP TRTK S100B binding was monitored by the percent change in tryptophan fluorescence Fluorescence plotted against free S100B concentration with a Kd of 0.518 0.08 M and an Rof 0.98. Next the same fluorescence techniques were repeated to acquire the binding affinity of the TRTK12 peptide alone to S100B. As expected the major binding residue W7 of the TRTK12 peptide displayed strong tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 350 nm . Titration of S100B into a solution containing 5.0 M TRTK12 showed a decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of TRTK12 upon addition of S100B from 100 nM to 2.5 M . Also depletion of calcium inhibited this S100B binding process and had little effect on the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of TRTK12 at 350 nm . TRTK12 S100B binding was monitored by the A Fluorescence plotted against free S100B concentration with a Kd of 0.211 0.029 M and an Rof 0.98. The results are supported by earlier reports that found that the TRTK12 peptide had an S100B binding affinity between 200 300 nM Wright et al. 2009 . Overall the binding data indicated that the addition of Synb1 ELP to the TRTK12 peptide to created Synb1 ELP TRTK had a 2 fold impact on S100B binding affinity compared to the TRTK12 peptide alone where Synb1 ELP TRTK maintains a high S100B binding affinity.

S100B is a known RAGE ligand where S100B uptake is mediated through RAGE receptor binding Leclerc et al. 2007 Perrone et al. 2008 . The neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell line is a well known RAGE expressing cell line and has been widely used to study S100B RAGE signaling Leclerc et al. 2007 . Treatment of SHSY5Y cells with fluorescent labeled S100B 488 S100B displayed a localization of S100B in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus . It was contemplated that Synb1 ELP TRTK could block S100B RAGE signaling and reduce S100B uptake in SHSY5Y cells which was studied by pretreating SHSY5Y cells with Synb1 ELP GGC or Synb1 ELP TRTK for 1 hr followed by 488 S100B treatment. Synb1 ELP GGC pretreatment had no effect on 488 S100B uptake however Synb1 ELP TRTK pretreatment reduced 488 S100B cellular uptake and localized 488 S100B to large extracellular aggregates . These results reconfirmed earlier reports that Synb1 ELP based peptides show both extracellular and intracellular localization in cultured cells Bidwell et al. 2010 . Using flow cytometry techniques under the same experimental conditions the epi fluorescence results were further validated. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Synb1 ELP TRTK pretreatment significantly reduced 488 S100B uptake in SHSY5Y cells compared to Control and Synb1 ELP GGC pretreated cells . This data suggest that the therapeutic peptide Synb1 ELP TRTK can be used to block S100B RAGE signaling.

S100B acts both as a neurotrophic and a neurotoxic signaling molecule where its toxicity is based on its concentration in the extracellular environment Donato 1991 1999 2001 Donato et al. 2009 . High levels of S100B through S100B RAGE signaling causes the production of ROS and downstream oxidative stress Rothermundt et al. 2003 Donato et al. 2009 Sorci et al. 2010 . S100B RAGE signaling has also been shown to produce ROS in SHSY5Y cells Leclerc et al. 2007 . Studies were designed to determine whether SHSY5Y cells expressing the mutant form of ataxin 1 ATNX1 82Q would be more susceptible to oxidative stress through S100B RAGE signaling compare to SHSY5Y cells expressing normal ataxin 1 ATXN1 30Q . A recent report found that the super oxide dismutase SOD enzyme is sequestered to mutant ataxin 1 inclusion bodies and suggests that polyglutamine expanded ataxin 1 increases the levels of reactive oxygen species by reducing the functional activity of SOD Kim et al. 2003b . Loss of SOD function in mutant ataxin 1 expressing cells is further supported by reports demonstrating that ATXN1 82Q expressing cells are more susceptible to oxidative damaged compared to ATXN1 30Q expressing cells Kim et al. 2003a Kim et al. 2003b Ryu et al. 2010 . Stable expressing GFP ATXN1 82Q and GFP ATXN1 30Q SHSY5Y cell lines were produced by G418 selection. Once established GFP ATXN1 82Q and GFP ATXN1 30Q SHSY5Y cell lines were further differentiated into neurons by TPA treatment. TPA has been used to differentiate SHSY5Y cells into neurons where differentiated SHSY5Y cells grow long neuronal processes or neurites and express the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin Presgraves et al. 2004 Cheung et al. 2009 . After TPA treatment both of GFP ATXN1 82Q and GFP ATXN1 30Q not shown SHSY5Y cell lines expressed the synaptophysin protein and grew long neuronal processes. Also both GFP ATXN1 82Q and GFP ATXN1 30Q not shown SHSY5Y cell lines expressed the RAGE receptor after TPA treatment. Knowing that both differentiated GFP ATXN1 82Q and GFP ATXN1 30Q SHSY5Y cell expressed RAGE the impact of S100B was tested on cells with neurites. It was found that after S100B treatment ATXN1 82Q expressing neurons showed a significant reduction in the percentage of cells with neurites compared to untreated ATXN1 82Q expressing neurons . Further S100B treatment significantly reduced neurite length in ATXN1 82Q expressing neurons compared to untreated ATXN1 82Q expressing neurons . However S100B treatment had no significant effect on ATXN1 30Q expressing cells compared to untreated cells . The loss of SOD function due to ATXN1 82Q expression and the ROS production activated by S100B RAGE signaling may cause increased oxidative damage in ATXN1 82Q expressing neurons activating the neurodegenerative processes. The Oxyblot technique has been used to detect the level of oxidized protein in cultured SHSY5Y cell resulting from ROS production Jiang et al. 2004 Takano et al. 2007 . Using this technique TPA differentiated GFP ATXN1 82Q and GFP ATXN1 30Q SHSY5Y cell with S100B were treated and S100B s impact on the level of oxidized proteins compared to the level of tubulin protein was analyzed. It was found that differentiated GFP ATXN1 82Q cells displayed a greater level of oxidized proteins when treated with S100B compared to GFP ATXN1 30Q cells . Furthermore Synb1 ELP TRTK pretreatment significantly blocked S100B s impact on the level of oxidized proteins in ATXN1 82Q cells . HOinduced oxidative damage was used as a positive control to ensure the Oxyblot technique was working properly. It was found that mutant ataxin 1 expressing cells are more sensitive to HOcompared to normal ataxin 1 expressing cells this confirmed earlier reports that ATXN1 82Q expressing cells display higher oxidative damage compared to ATXN1 30Q cells when exposed to HO Kim et al. 2003a Kim et al. 2003b Ryu et al. 2010 . Previously it has been shown that TRTK12 peptide improves SCA1 PC morphology in cerebellar slice cultures Vig et al. 2011 . The fact that RAGE is highly expressed in PCs of the cerebellum along with the findings that ATXN1 82Q expressing neurons are more sensitive to S100B RAGE signaling as well as the beneficial effects of TRTK12 on SCA1 PCs in slice culture defines a role for S100B as a toxic signaling protein in the SCA1 neurodegenerative pathway. Therefore using therapeutic peptides such as Synb1 ELP TRTK to block S100B induced neurotoxic effects is a novel SCA1 treatment strategy.

Research has shown that hyperthermic targeting of the ELP biopolymer to tumor vasculature is a very effective methodology to concentrate the macromolecular drug carrier ELP to specific biological locations Meyer et al. 2001 Liu et al. 2006 Dreher et al. 2007 . Furthermore thermal cycling has been shown to be more efficient than continuous heating to increase the accumulation and delivery of ELP to tumors in mice models Dreher et al. 2007 . To test the feasibility of heating the mouse cerebellum without drastically heating other areas of the brain a temperature probe was inserted into the cerebellum as well as the frontal lobe and monitored temperature changes under a thermal cycling procedure . The thermal cycling procedure consisted of 30 minutes of heating and 5 minutes of cooling followed by two additional cycles of 20 minutes of heating and 5 minutes of cooling where a 785 nm laser pointed at the cerebellum was used as the heating source. During the thermal cycling procedure the temperature of the cerebellum reached a maximum temperature of 40 C. remaining 2 degrees above the frontal lobe temperature as well as the body temperature . Next the localization and accumulation of Synb1 ELP GGC the control peptide lacking the TRTK12 modification was monitored in the brain under heated and unheated conditions. The Synb1 ELP GGC peptide contains only one cysteine residue found at the end of the C terminus. Synb1 ELP GCC was labeled on the C terminal cysteine residue with Alexa 750 fluorescent dye according to the manufacture s protocol. Three 3 week old FVB WT mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and given an IP injection of 100 mg kg fluorescent labeled Synb1 ELP GGC suspended in a saline solution or saline alone. One hour post injection the cerebellum of one animal was externally heated using the thermal cycling procedure above while the other animals were left unheated. 2 hrs post heating the animals were euthanized by C0inhalation and their brains and organs removed. The brains were then lined up and photographed with the IVIS Animal Imager with an Excitation wavelength of 745 nm and an Emission wavelength of 800 nm . Shown is the image displaying a photograph of the brains and the fluorescent uptake of labeled Synb1 ELP GGC. The Overlay image shows that thermal cycling is an effective targeting method to increase localization of Synb1 ELP GGC to the cerebellum. The Epi fluorescent color scale measures Radiant Efficiency where blue coloration is low fluorescence red is mid level fluorescence and green is high fluorescence . Next the IVIS software was used to measure the change in Radiant Efficiency of the cerebellum after thermal targeting of Synb1 ELP GGC to the cerebellum compared to unheated and saline treated animals. A significant increase in the Radiant Efficiency of the cerebellum was found after a thermal cycling procedure compared to the unheated and the control cerebellums . Next the bio distribution of Synb1 ELP GGC was looked at in the brain heart spleen lung kidney and liver from control animals unheated animals and animals where the cerebellum was heated by thermal cycling. It was found that heating the brain had no significant effect on Synb1 ELP GGC levels in the various organs analyzed. However there appears to be an increase in the total brain uptake in animals where the cerebellum was heated compared to unheated animals however the increase was not significant . The increase in brain uptake is most likely due to the enhanced localization of Synb1 ELP GGC to the cerebellum induced by the focused hyperthermia. Our results are a unique finding as ELP peptide transport into the brain has never been studied. Overall it was found that thermal targeting by applying local focused hyperthermia significantly increased Synb1 ELP GGC localization to the cerebellum. This is the first evidence demonstrating that ELP based therapeutics can be thermally targeted to a particular region of the brain to combat neurodegenerative diseases.

It has been recently reported that the S100B inhibitory peptide TRTK12 modulates mutant ataxin 1 mediated PC morphology in slice cultures and improves behavioral abnormalities in SCA1 mice Vig et al. 2011 . The TRTK12 peptide was developed from the high specificity S100B binding protein CapZ Charpentier et al. 2010 . The possibility of TRTK12 non specific interactions is limited by the extensive biophysical characterization of the TRTK12 S100B interaction using solution NMR and X ray crystallography techniques Inman et al. 2002 Charpentier et al. 2010 . To further amplify the therapeutic benefits and enhance TRTK12 delivery to the cerebellum the first thermally responsive S100B inhibitory peptide Synb1 ELP TRTK was designed. The peptide interacts with its molecular target S100B . Though the S100B binding affinities of both Synb1 ELP TRTK and TRTK12 peptide alone are in the nanomolar range it is believed that the Synb1 ELP TRTK polypeptide has an added advantage over TRTK12 alone due to its enhanced intracellular accumulation from the CPP Synb1 and from the thermal response of ELP. To support the argument that the TRTK12 peptide of the Synb1 ELP TRTK polypeptide maintains its biological function it was shown that Synb1 ELP TRTK reduces S100B RAGE mediated uptake as well as S100B induced oxidative damage in mutant ataxin 1 expressing cells . Furthermore it was shown that thermal targeting of Synb1 ELP GGC by applying local hyperthermia to the cerebellum after systemic administration of the polypeptide is a novel treatment strategy to increase therapeutic peptide uptake and delivery to the cerebellum .

In this study the role of BG in the SCA1 pathogenesis is further characterized and it is shown that S100B RAGE signaling directly influences degeneration of mutant ataxin 1 expressing neurons by an oxidative stress mechanism . The RAGE receptor is highly expressed in PCs of the cerebellum and due to the loss of SOD function mutant ataxin 1 expressing neurons are more susceptible to oxidative damage through S100B RAGE signaling Kim et al. 2003a Kim et al. 2003b Vig et al. 2006 Ryu et al. 2010 . Thus signaling mechanisms that stimulate ROS production in SCA1 PCs are major contributing factors in oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. Reports indicate that S100B transport is mediated by a RAGE dependent uptake mechanism both in vitro and in vivo Vig et al. 2006 Perrone et al. 2008 . The presence of S100B vacuoles in degenerating SCA1 PCs along with the improvements in SCA1 mice by TRTK12 treatment is striking evidence indicating the neurotoxic effects of S100B signaling Vig et al. 2006 Vig et al. 2009 Vig et al. 2011 . S100B is a damage associated protein where S100B RAGE signaling causes the production of ROS and oxidative stress Rothermundt et al. 2003 Donato et al. 2009 Sorci et al. 2010 . Furthermore S100B has been reported to play a neurodegenerative role in brain injury Alzheimer s disease as well as Down syndrome Griffin et al. 1989 Kato et al. 1990 Rothermundt et al. 2003 Mori et al. 2010 . S100B has been shown to increase tau protein hyper phosphorylation and exacerbates cerebral amyloidosis in the Alzheimer s disease mouse model Esposito et al. 2008 Mori et al. 2010 . Interestingly S100B ablation has been shown to improve Alzheimer s disease pathology in Tg mice Roltsch et al. 2010 . Since S100B specific inhibitors are not currently available the use of S100B peptide based inhibitors is a novel treatment strategy for reducing S100B mediated effects in a number of neurodegenerative diseases where high S100B levels contribute to pathology.

This work also presents the novel strategy of utilizing the thermally responsive Elastin like polypeptide for thermally targeted delivery of agents to the cerebellum to treat neurological disorders. Thermal targeting of ELP to tumors has shown promising results Meyer et al. 2001 Liu et al. 2006 Dreher et al. 2007 and a thermal cycling protocol similar to that used in this work has been shown to be beneficial compared to long sessions of constant hyperthermia Dreher et al. 2007 . These previous studies have demonstrated that ELP has characteristics including a long plasma half life resistance to proteolysis tumor targeting Liu et al. 2006 and the ability to escape the vasculature and enter tumor cells Bidwell and Raucher 2010 that are desirable in a drug delivery agent. However there has been no demonstration of the use of ELP for thermally targeted delivery to the brain. The results shown here indicate that brain delivery is feasible and the technology necessary for delivery of hyperthermia to the brain currently exists in the clinical setting in the form of MRI guided high intensity focused ultrasound Ram et al. 2006 Martin et al. 2009 Hertzberg et al. 2010 . Future work will examine the ability of ELP to deliver the TRTK12 peptide to PCs in vivo and will define the efficacy of this approach for treatment of SCA1 using a Tg mouse model. If efficacious this approach can be taken beyond TRTK12 peptide delivery and SCA1. The ELP delivery system can be modified to accommodate a large repertoire of cargo including peptides drugs or DNA to treat a multitude of CNS diseases making a huge impact on the neurodegenerative field Bidwell and Raucher 2005 Bidwell et al. 2007 Chen et al. 2008 Bidwell and Raucher 2009 MacKay et al. 2009 Raucher et al. 2009 .
