Prostate cancer CaP is the most common malignancy in American men and second leading cause of cancer mortality Landis et al. 1999 Cancer J. Clin. 49 8 31 Jemal et al. 2004 Cancer J Clin 54 8 29 . The molecular determinants in the development and progression of this disease are poorly understood. In recent years there have been intensive investigations of molecular genetics of the CaP. To date however oncogene tumor suppressor gene or other gene alterations common to most CaPs have not been found. Alterations of tumor suppressors such as p53 PTEN and p27 or oncogenes such as BCL2 HER2 and C MYC associate with only small subsets of primary CaP with more frequent association observed in advanced CaP.

Current clinical parameters including serum Prostate Specific Antigen PSA tumor stage and Gleason score are routinely used as risk factors at the time of diagnosis but have limited application to identify patients at a greater risk for developing aggressive CaP. Approximately 30 40 of patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized CaP have been found to have microscopic disease that is not organ confined and a significant portion of these patients relapse. Singh et al. Cancer Cell 2000 1 203 209 Henshell et at. Can. Res. 2003 63 4196 4203 . Therefore discovery of novel biomarkers or gene expression patterns defining CaP onset and progression is crucial in predicting patients with greater risk to develop aggressive CaP.

CaP specific genetic alterations have been the subject of intensive research by several investigations in the past five years Srikatan et al. In Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment 2002 Springer Verlag 25 40 Karan et al. Int. J. Can. 2003 103 285 293 Augustus et al. In Molecular Pathology of Early Cancer 1999 IOS press 321 340 Moul et al. Clin Prostate Cancer 2002 1 42 50 Lalani et al. Cancer and Mets Rev 1997 16 29 66 Issacs et al. Epidemiol Rev 2001 23 36 41 Ozen et al. Anticancer Res 2000 20 1905 1912 Morton et al. J Natl Med Assoc 1998 90 S728 731 . Promising leads both in biology and translational research areas are beginning to emerge from recent genomics and proteomics technology as well as traditional approaches. However the inherent heterogeneity of CaP has hampered the molecular characterization of CaP.

One of the challenges in studying molecular alterations in human cancers including prostate tumors is to define the relative contributions of genetic alterations in epithelial and non epithelial components of the target organ in the process of tumorigeneis. Despite advances in technology changes in human CaP specific epithelial and stromal cell associated gene expression are still not well understood.

Despite recent advances in the identification of molecular alterations associated with certain prostate cancers the heterogeneous nature of prostate tissue has hindered the identification of genetic targets common to all or at least the vast majority of prostate cancers. The complexity and heterogeneity of prostate cancer has also hindered the identification of targets that allow differentiation between clinically aggressive and non aggressive cancers at the time of diagnosis. Therefore there remains a need to identify molecular alterations specific for a pathologically defined cell population that can provide important clues for optimal diagnosis and prognosis and help to establish individualized treatments tailored to the molecular profile of the tumor.

Citation of references herein shall not be construed as an admission that such references are prior art to the present invention.

It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide methods and kits for detecting cancer in particular prostate cancer. These methods and kits can be used to detect either qualitatively or quantitatively nucleic acids or proteins that serve as cancer markers. For example the expression of the prostate cancer cell specific gene ERG when detected in a biological sample from a subject either alone or in combination with other cancer markers including the expression of other prostate cancer cell specific genes can be used to indicate the presence of prostate cancer in the subject or a higher predisposition of the subject to develop prostate cancer. Detecting ERG expression alone or in combination with the expression of any gene identified in Tables 1 6 can thus be used to diagnose or prognose cancer particularly prostate cancer.

According to one aspect of the invention the method for detecting the expression of one or more prostate cancer cell specific genes such as ERG AMACR and LTF or the DD3 gene in a biological sample comprises 

The method preferably comprises detecting the expression of the following combinations of genes 1 ERG and AMACR 2 ERG and DD3 and 3 ERG AMACR and DD3. In another embodiment the method comprises detecting LTF and one or more of ERG AMACR and DD3. Expression of these genes can also be detected by measuring ERG AMACR or LTF polypeptides in the biological sample.

The biological sample is preferably a prostate tissue blood or urine sample. Detecting a signal resulting from hybridization between the oligonucleotide probe and the at least one amplification product can be used to diagnose or prognose cancer particularly prostate cancer.

The oligonucleotide probe may be optionally fixed to a solid support. When detecting ERG expression in a biological sample the oligonucleotide probe first oligonucleotide primer and second oligonucleotide primer each comprise a nucleic acid sequence that is capable of hybridizing under defined conditions preferably under high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes to SEQ ID NO 1. Thus the oligonucleotide probe first oligonucleotide primer and second oligonucleotide primer can include for example SEQ ID NO 1 itself or a fragment thereof or a sequence complementary thereto. Preferably the oligonucleotide probe first oligonucleotide primer or second oligonucleotide primer is a fragment of SEQ ID NO 1 having at least about 15 at least about 20 or at least about 50 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO 1 or a sequence complementary thereto. When detecting ERG expression the target sequence is preferably a fragment of SEQ ID NO 1. Probes primers and target sequences can be similarly derived from other genes of interest such as DD3 SEQ ID NO 4 and other prostate cancer cell specific genes including for example AMACR SEQ ID NO 3 and LTF SEQ ID NO 5 .

In a related aspect of the invention the method of diagnosing or prognosing prostate cancer comprises 

The skilled artisan will understand how to correlate expression levels or patterns of the desired genes with the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition to develop prostate cancer. For example the expression levels can be quantified such that increased or decreased expression levels relative to a control sample or other standardized value or numerical range indicate the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition to develop prostate cancer.

The increased or decreased expression levels in the methods of the invention may be measured relative to the expression level of the prostate cancer cell specific gene or polypeptide in normal matched tissue such as benign prostate epithelial cells from the same subject. Alternatively the expression level of a gene or polypeptide may be measured relative to the expression of the gene or polypeptide in other noncancerous samples from the subject or in samples obtained from a different subject without cancer. Expression of a gene may also be normalized by comparing it to the expression of other cancer specific markers. For example in prostate cancer a prostate cell specific marker such as PSA can be used as a control to compare and or normalize expression levels of other genes such as ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR. By way of example the method of diagnosing or prognosing prostate cancer comprises measuring the expression levels of the ERG DD3 and or AMACR gene and diagnosing or prognosing prostate cancer where an increased expression level of the ERG DD3 and or AMACR gene of at least two times as compared to the control sample indicates the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition in the subject to develop prostate cancer. Conversely by way of example in such a method of diagnosing or prognosing prostate cancer a decreased expression of the LTF gene of at least two times as compared to the control sample indicates the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition in the subject to develop prostate cancer.

The expression levels of prostate cancer cell specific genes e.g. mRNA or polypeptide expression can be detected according to the methods described herein or using any other known detection methods including without limitation immunohistochemistry Southern blotting Northern blotting Western blotting ELISA and nucleic acid amplification procedures including but not limited to PCR transcription mediated amplification TMA nucleic acid sequence based amplification NASBA self sustained sequence replication 3SR ligase chain reaction LCR strand displacement amplification SDA and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification LAMP .

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of determining a gene expression pattern in a biological sample where the pattern can be correlated with the presence or absence of tumor cells particularly prostate tumor cells. For example ERG is detected in combination with other prostate cancer cell specific genes identified in Tables 1 6 including AMACR and or LTF to obtain expression profiles from biological samples. The expression profiles of these prostate cancer cell specific genes are useful for detecing cancer particularly prostate cancer. ERG can also be detected in combination with DD3 with or without other prostate cancer cell specific genes such as AMACR and or LTF to obtain expression profiles from biological samples. These expression profiles are also useful for detecting cancer particularly prostate cancer. Increased levels of ERG AMACR and or DD3 in a biological sample indicate the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition in the subject to develop prostate cancer. Decreased levels of LTF in a biological sample indicate the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition in the subject to develop prostate cancer.

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of determining a gene expression pattern in a biological sample where the pattern can be used to indicate or predict the pathologic stage of cancer particularly prostate cancer. For example the gene expression pattern can be used to indicate or predict a moderate risk prostate cancer or a high risk prostate cancer or to predict whether the prostate cancer is progressing or regressing or in remission. The gene expression pattern can also be used as a prognostic indictor of disease free survival following radical prostatectomy. In a particular embodiment gene expression patterns are derived from the expression level of the ERG gene alone or in combination with other prostate cancer cell specific genes identified in Tables 1 6 including AMACR and LTF or DD3.

Kits for detecting cancer particularly prostate cancer are also provided. These kits comprise a nucleic acid probe such as the ones described herein that hybridizes to a prostate cancer cell specific gene. In one embodiment the nucleic acid probe hybridizes to SEQ ID NO 1 ERG or the complement thereof under defined hybridization conditions preferably under high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes and includes SEQ ID NO 1 itself or a fragment of SEQ ID NO 1 having at least about 15 at least about 20 or at least about 50 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO 1 or a sequence complementary thereto. In a particular embodiment the probe selectively hybridizes to the ERG1 and ERG2 isoforms but not to ERG isoforms 3 9. In another embodiment the probe selectively hybridizes to the ERG1 isoform but not to ERG isoforms 2 9. The nucleic acid probe may be optionally fixed to a solid support.

The kit may also contain at least one additional nucleic acid probe that hybridizes preferably high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes to DD3 SEQ ID NO 4 or a gene identified in Tables 1 6 including for example AMACR SEQ ID NO 3 or LTF SEQ ID NO 5 . In one embodiment the kit comprises a first oligonucloetide probe capable of hybridizing to SEQ ID NO 1 ERG or a sequence complimentary thereto under conditions of high stringency and at least one other oligonucleotide probe capable of hybridizing to SEQ ID NO 3 AMACR or a sequence complimentary thereto or to SEQ ID NO 4 DD3 or a sequence complementary thereto or to a gene identified in Tables 1 6 under conditions of high stringency. In a related embodiment the kit having an ERG and AMACR probe further comprises a third oligonucleotide probe capable of hybridzing to SEQ ID NO 4 DD3 or a sequence complementary thereto. The kits described herein may optionally contain an oligonucleotide probe capable of hybridizing to SEQ ID NO 5 LTF or a sequence complementary thereto under conditions of high stringency.

The kits may further comprise a first oligonucleotide primer and a second oligonucleotide primer where the first oligonucleotide primer contains a sequence that hybridizes to a first sequence in SEQ ID NO 1 and the second oligonucleotide primer contains a sequence that hybridizes to a second sequence in a nucleic acid strand complementary to SEQ ID NO 1 wherein the first sequence does not overlap with the second sequence. The first and second oligonucleotide primers are capable of amplifying a target sequence of interest in SEQ ID NO 1. Similarly the kits can further comprise first and second oligonucleotide primers derived from DD3 SEQ ID NO 4 or a prostate cancer cell specific gene including for example AMACR SEQ ID NO 3 or LTF SEQ ID NO 5 .

It is another object of the invention to provide therapeutic methods of treating cancer in particular prostate cancer.

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide screening methods for identifying compounds that modulate expression of a CaP cell specific gene such as ERG in prostate cancer cells.

The present invention is based in part on the identification of gene expression signatures that correlate with a high risk of CaP progression. Over expression or under expression of specific genes are predictive of tumor progression. The invention provides genes such as the ERG gene and analogs of specific genes that can be used alone or in combination with DD3 or other CaP cell specific genes such as AMACR or LTF to function as diagnostic and prognostic targets for cancer particularly prostate tumors. The invention further provides genes such as the ERG gene and analogs of specific genes that can be used alone or in combination as therapeutic targets for cancer in particular prostate tumors.

The invention further discloses diagnostic kits comprised of an anti CaP cell specific gene antibody for example an anti ERG gene antibody which is optionally detectably labeled. A kit is also provided that comprises nucleic acid primer sequences and or a nucleic acid probe capable of hybridizing under defined conditions preferably high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes to an ERG nucleic acid. The kits may also contain an anti DD3 gene antibody or a second anti CaP cell specific gene antibody such as an anti AMACR or anti LTF gene antibody or a second set of nucleic acid primer sequences and or a nucleic acid probe capable of hybridizing under defined conditions to the DD3 gene or another CaP cell specific gene such as the AMACR or LTF gene.

The disclosed CaP cell specific genes such as ERG can be used alone or in combination as biomarkers of cancer and in particular prostate cancers and other related diseases as targets for therapeutic intervention or as gene therapy agents.

The invention provides for treatment of disorders of hyperproliferation e.g. cancer benign tumors by administering compounds that modulate expression of the specific genes.

Methods of screening cancer cells and in particular prostate cancer cells for specific gene expression signatures including ERG gene expression signatures alone or in combination with DD3 gene expression signatures or other CaP cell specific gene expression signatures such as AMACR or LTF are provided.

Additional objects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description following and in part will be understood from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

The term CaP cell specific gene or prostate cancer cell specific gene refers to a gene identified in Tables 1 6. The definition further encompasses CaP cell specific gene analogs e.g. orthologues and homologues and functionally equivalent fragments of CaP cell specific genes or their analogs the expression of which is either upregulated or downregulated in prostate cancer cells.

The term CaP cell specific gene expression signature refers to the pattern of upregulation or downregulation of product expression as measured by the Affymetrix GeneChip assay described in Example 1 the QRT PCR assay described in Example 2 or any other quantitative expression assay known in the art.

The term ERG refers to the ERG gene or ERG cDNA or mRNA described herein and includes ERG isoforms such as ERG1 and ERG2. The cDNA sequence of the ERG1 gene is published in GenBank under the accession number M21535. The cDNA sequence of the ERG2 gene is published in GenBank under the accession number M17254.

The term AMACR refers to the AMACR gene or AMACR cDNA or mRNA described herein and includes AMACR isoforms. The cDNA sequence of the AMACR gene is published in GenBank under the accession number NM 014324.

The term DD3 refers to the DD3 gene or DD3 cDNA or mRNA described herein and includes DD3 isoforms. The cDNA sequence of the DD3 gene is published in GenBank under the accession number AF 103907 and is also disclosed in WO 98 45420 1998 . Although DD3 was originally used to describe a fragment of exon 4 of the prostate cancer antigen 3 PCA3 gene the term as used in herein is not so limited. DD3 is intended to refer to the entire DD3 gene or cDNA or mRNA which in the art is also commonly referred to as PCA3.

The term LTF refers to the LTF gene or LTF cDNA or mRNA described herein and includes LTF isoforms. The cDNA sequence of the LTF gene is published in GenBank under the accession number NM 002343.

The term polypeptide is used interchangeably with the terms peptide and protein and refers to any chain of amino acids regardless of length or posttranslational modification e.g. glycosylation or phosphorylation or source e.g. species .

The phrase substantially identical or substantially as set out means that a relevant sequence is at least 70 75 80 85 90 95 97 98 or 99 identical to a given sequence. By way of example such sequences may be allelic variants sequences derived from various species or they may be derived from the given sequence by truncation deletion amino acid substitution or addition. For polypeptides the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least 20 30 50 100 or more amino acids. For nucleic acids the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least 50 100 150 300 or more nucleotides. Percent identity between two sequences is determined by standard alignment algorithms such as for example Basic Local Alignment Tool BLAST described in Altschul et al. 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410 the algorithm of Needleman et al. 1970 J. Mol. Biol. 48 444 453 or the algorithm of Meyers et al. 1988 Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4 11 17.

The terms specific interaction specific binding or the like mean that two molecules form a complex that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. The term is also applicable where e.g. an antigen binding domain is specific for a particular epitope which is carried by a number of antigens in which case the specific binding member carrying the antigen binding domain will be able to bind to the various antigens carrying the epitope. Specific binding is characterized by a high affinity and a low to moderate capacity. Nonspecific binding usually has a low affinity with a moderate to high capacity. Typically the binding is considered specific when the affinity constant Kis higher than 10M more preferably higher than 10M and most preferably 10M. If necessary non specific binding can be reduced without substantially affecting specific binding by varying the binding conditions. Such conditions are known in the art and a skilled artisan using routine techniques can select appropriate conditions. The conditions are usually defined in terms of concentration of antibodies ionic strength of the solution temperature time allowed for binding concentration of non related molecules e.g. serum albumin milk casein etc. The term detectably labeled refers to any means for marking and identifying the presence of a molecule e.g. an oligonucleotide probe or primer a gene or fragment thereof or a cDNA molecule. Methods for labeling a molecule are well known in the art and include without limitation radioactive labeling e.g. with an isotope such as P S or I and nonradioactive labeling e.g. fluorescent and chemiluminescent labeling .

The term modulatory compound is used interchangeably with the term therapeutic as used herein means any compound capable of modulating either CaP cell specific gene expression at the transcriptional translational or post translational levels or modulating the biological activity of a CaP cell specific polypeptide. The term modulate and its cognates refer to the capability of a compound acting as either an agonist or an antagonist of a certain reaction or activity. The term modulate therefore encompasses the terms activate and inhibit. The term activate for example refers to an increase in the expression of the CaP cell specific gene or activity of a CaP cell specific polypeptide in the presence of a modulatory compound relative to the activity of the gene or the polypeptide in the absence of the same compound. The increase in the expression level or the activity is preferably at least about 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or higher. Analogously the term inhibit refers to a decrease in the expression of the CaP cell specific gene or activity of a CaP cell specific polypeptide in the presence of a modulatory compound relative to the activity of the gene or the polypeptide in the absence of the same compound. The decrease in the expression level or the activity is preferably at least about 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or higher. The expression level of the CaP cell specific gene or activity of a CaP cell specific polypeptide can be measured as described herein or by techniques generally known in the art.

The term treatment is used interchangeably herein with the term therapeutic method and refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic preventative measures. Those in need of treatment may include individuals already having a particular medical disorder as well as those who may ultimately acquire the disorder.

The term isolated refers to a molecule that is substantially free of its natural environment. Any amount of that molecule elevated over the naturally occurring levels due to any manipulation e.g. over expression partial purification etc. is encompassed with the definition. With regard to partially purified compositions only the term refers to an isolated compound that is at least 50 70 70 90 90 95 w w or more pure.

The term effective dose or effective amount refers to that amount of the compound that results in amelioration of symptoms in a patient or a desired biological outcome e.g. inhibition of cell proliferation. The effective amount can be determined as described in the subsequent sections.

The terms polynucleotide oligonucleotide nucleic acid and DNA are used interchangeably herein and refer to deoxyribonucleic acid DNA and where appropriate ribonucleic acid RNA . The term should also be understood to include nucleotide analogs and single or double stranded polynucleotides. Examples of polynucleotides include but are not limited to plasmid DNA or fragments thereof viral DNA or RNA anti sense RNA etc. The term plasmid DNA refers to double stranded DNA that is circular.

As used herein the term hybridization under defined conditions or hybridizing under defined conditions is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washes under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain bound to each other. The conditions are such that sequences which are at least about 6 and more preferably at least about 20 50 100 150 300 or more nucleotides long and at least about 70 more preferably at least about 80 even more preferably at least about 85 90 identical remain bound to each other. The percent identity can be determined as described in Altschul et al. 1997 Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402.

Appropriate hybridization conditions can be selected by those skilled in the art with minimal experimentation as exemplified in Ausubel et al. 2004 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons. Additionally stringent conditions are described in Sambrook et al. 2001 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. A nonlimiting example of defined conditions of low stringency is as follows. Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 6 hours at 40 C. in a solution containing 35 formamide 5 SSC 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 5 mM EDTA 0.1 PVP 0.1 Ficoll 1 BSA and 500 g ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations are carried out in the same solution with the following modifications 0.02 PVP 0.02 Ficoll 0.2 BSA 100 g ml salmon sperm DNA 10 wt vol dextran sulfate and 5 20 10cpm P labeled probe is used. Filters are incubated in hybridization mixture for 18 20 hours at 40 C. and then washed for 1.5 hours at 55 C. in a solution containing 2 SSC 25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 5 mM EDTA and 0.1 SDS. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and incubated an additional 1.5 hours at 60 C. Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. Other conditions of low stringency well known in the art may be used e.g. as employed for cross species hybridizations .

A non limiting example of defined conditions of high stringency is as follows. Prehybridization of filters containing DNA is carried out for 8 hours to overnight at 65 C. in buffer composed of 6 SSC 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA 0.02 PVP 0.02 Ficoll 0.02 BSA and 500 g ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters are hybridized for 48 hours at 65 C. in the prehybridization mixture containing 100 g ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5 20 10cpm of P labeled probe. Washing of filters is done at 37 C. for 1 hour in a solution containing 2 SSC 0.01 PVP 0.01 Ficoll and 0.01 BSA. This is followed by a wash in 0.1 SSC at 50 C. for 45 minutes. Other conditions of high stringency well known in the art may be used. An oligonucleotide hybridizes specifically to a target sequence under high stringency conditions.

The term solid support means a material that is essentially insoluble under the solvent and temperature conditions of the assay method comprising free chemical groups available for joining an oligonucleotide or nucleic acid. Preferably the solid support is covalently coupled to an oligonucleotide designed to directly or indirectly bind a target nucleic acid. When the target nucleic acid is an mRNA the oligonucleotide attached to the solid support is preferably a poly T sequence. A preferred solid support is a particle such as a micron or submicron sized bead or sphere. A variety of solid support materials are contemplated such as for example silica polyacrylate polyacrylamide a metal polystyrene latex nitrocellulose polypropylene nylon or combinations thereof. More preferably the solid support is capable of being attracted to a location by means of a magnetic field such as a solid support having a magnetite core. Particularly preferred supports are monodisperse magnetic spheres i.e. uniform size. .about 5 .

The term detecting or detection means any of a variety of methods for determining the presence of a nucleic acid such as for example hybridizing a labeled probe to a portion of the nucleic acid. A labeled probe is an oligonucleotide that specifically binds to another sequence and contains a detectable group which may be for example a fluorescent moiety a chemiluminescent moiety such as an acridinium ester AE moiety that can be detected chemiluminescently under appropriate conditions as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 283 174 a radioisotope biotin avidin enzyme enzyme substrate or other reactive group. Other well know detection techniques include for example gel filtration gel electrophoresis and visualization of the amplicons and High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC . As used throughout the specification the term detecting or detection includes either qualitative or quantitative detection.

The term primer or oligonculeotide primer means an oligonucleotide capable of binding to a region of a target nucleic acid or its complement and promoting nucleic acid amplification of the target nucleic acid. Generally a primer will have a free 3 end that can be extended by a nucleic acid polymerase. Primers also generally include a base sequence capable of hybridizing via complementary base interactions either directly with at least one strand of the target nucleic acid or with a strand that is complementary to the target sequence. A primer may comprise target specific sequences and optionally other sequences that are non complementary to the target sequence. These non complementary sequences may comprise a promoter sequence or a restriction endonuclease recognition site.

The present invention is based in part on the identification and validation of consistent CaP epithelial cell specific gene expression signatures. These gene expression signatures define patients with CaP who are at risk to develop advanced disease by identifying genes and pathways in prostate epithelial cells that differentiate between aggressive and non aggressive courses of cancer development. Two patient groups were selected a high risk HR group having for example PSA recurrence Gleason score 8 9 T3c stage seminal vesicle invasion poor tumor differentiation and a moderate risk MR group having for example no PSA recurrence Gleason score 6 7 T2a T3b stage no seminal vesicle invasion well or moderate tumor differentiation. The two patient groups were matched for known risk factors age race and family history of CaP. LCM derived epithelial cells from tumor and normal prostate of the two patient groups were compared by GeneChip analyses as described in the following Example 1. Results were validated using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR QRT PCR as described in the following Example 2. The group of genes identified and validated as having the highest association with aggressive or non aggressive CaP can be used to reliably determine the likely course of CaP progression.

Strikingly one of the most consistently over expressed genes in CaP cells identified in this study was the ERG ETS related gene oncogene a member of the ETS transcription factor family. Oikawa et al. Gene 2003 303 11 34 Sharrocks A D Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2001 2 11 827 37 Hart et al. Oncogene 1995 10 7 1423 30 Rao et al. Science 1987 237 4815 635 639 . Two isoforms of ERG ERG1 and ERG2 are over expressed with the highest frequency. The ERG1 coding sequence with start and stop codons underlined is publicly available through GenBank under the accession number M21535 as follows 

The ERG2 coding sequence is publicly available through GenBank under the accession number M17254 as follows with start and stop codons underlined 

Validation by QRT PCR TaqMan in microdissected tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells of 20 CaP patients confirmed a consistent tumor associated over expression of ERG isoforms ERG1 and or ERG2 in 95 of patients 19 of 20 . As a quality test and comparison the expression of AMACR a recently identified CaP tissue marker Rubin et al JAMA 2002 287 1662 1670 Luo et al. Cancer Res 2002 62 2220 2226 and of GSTP1 a gene known to have decreased expression in CaP Nelson et al. Ann N Y Acad Sci 2001 952 135 144 was also determined . Robust over expression in CaP cells of 95 of the patients similarly to ERG was observed for AMACR while the GSTP1 expression was significantly decreased in the tumor cells of each CaP patient confirming the high quality of the tumor and benign LCM specimens and the reliability of the QRT PCR.

Recently a detailed mapping of the chromosomal region 21q22.2 q22.3 containing the ERG gene as well as a complete exon intron structure with 9 alternative transcripts or isoforms has been described. Owczarek et al. Gene 2004 324 65 77 . The probes on the Affymetrix GeneChip used in our initial discovery of consistent ERG over expression in CaP as well as the TaqMan probe designed for the validation experiment recognize a region specific to the ERG 1 and 2 isoforms only.

Both ERG and ETS are proto oncogenes with mitogenic and transforming activity. Sharrocks A D Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2001 2 11 827 37 Seth et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1989 86 7833 7837 . Deregulation or chromosomal reorganization of ERG is linked to Ewing sarcoma myeloid leukemia and cervical carcinoma. DeAlva et al. Int J Surg Pathol 2001 9 7 17 Simpson et al. Oncogene 1997 14 2149 2157 Shimizu et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1993 90 10280 284 Papas et al. Am J Med Genet Suppl. 1990 7 251 261 . ETS2 has been implicated in CaP but it is over expressed only in a small proportion of CaP specimens. Liu et al. Prostate 1997 30 145 53 Semenchenko et al. Oncogene 1998 17 2883 88 . ERG over expression without amplification of DNA copy number was recently reported in acute myeloid leukemia. Balduc et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2004 101 3915 20 . Gavrilov et al. Eur J Cancer 2001 37 1033 40 examined the expression of various transcription factors including several proteins from the ETS family in a very limited number of high grade prostate cancer samples. Antibodies against the ETS family proteins Elf 1 and Fli 1 caused intense staining of most of the high grade prostate cancer samples. In contrast ERG protein while being detected in the noncancerous endothelial cells microvessels in the stroma of most samples tested was detected in only a minority of the high grade prostate cancers. ETS family proteins have a variety of expression patterns in human tissues. Oikawa et al. Gene 2003 303 11 34 . ERG is expressed in endothelial tissues hematopoietic cells kidney and in the urogenital tract. ERG proteins are nuclear transcription factors that form homodimers as well as heterodimers with several other members of the ETS family of transcription factors. Carrere et al. Oncogene 1998 16 25 3261 68 . A negative crosstalk observed between ERG and estrogen receptor ER alpha may be relevant in urogenital tissues where both transcription factors are expressed. Vlaeminck Guillem et al. Oncogene 2003 22 50 8072 84 . The present invention is based in part upon the surprising discovery that ERG is over expressed in the majority of CaP specimens analyzed indicating that this oncogene plays a role in prostate tumorigenesis most likely by modulating transcription of target genes favoring tumorigenesis in prostate epithelium.

The present invention is further based in part upon the over expression of the AMACR gene in prostate cancer epithelium. The cDNA sequence of the AMACR is publicly available through GenBank under the accession numbers NM 014324 and AF047020. The sequence with start and stop codons underlined corresponding to accession number NM 014324 is as follows 

The present invention is further based in part upon the over expression of the DD3 gene in prostate cancer epithelium. The cDNA sequence of the DD3 gene is publicly available through GenBank under the accession number AF103907. The sequence corresponding to accession number AF103907 is as follows 

The DD3 gene appears to represent a non coding nucleic acid. Therefore no start and stop codons have been indicated.

The present invention is further based in part upon the under expression of the LTF gene in prostate cancer epithelium. The cDNA sequence of the lactotransferrin LTF gene is publicly available through GenBank under the accession number NM 002343. The sequence with start and stop codons underlined corresponding to accession number NM 002343 is as follows 

LTF is a non heme iron binding glycoprotein and a member of the transferring gene family. Bowman et al. Adv. Genet. 25 1 38 1988 Park et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82 3149 53 1985 . The concentration of LTF in human prostate is hormone dependent and its expression is regulated by estrogen. van Sande et al. Urol. Res. 9 5 241 244 1981 Teng et al. Biochem. Cell Biol. 80 7 16 2002 Teng et al. Mol. Human Reproduction. 8 1 58 67 2002 . LTF has also been implicated in certain cancers. For example bovine LTF inhibits colon esophagus lung and bladder carcinomas in rats. Tsuda et al. Biochem. Cell Biol. 80 131 136 2002 Tsuda et al. Biofactors. 12 1 4 83 8 2000 Tsuda et al. Biofactors. 12 1 4 83 8 2000 Tsuda et al. Mutat Res. 462 2 3 227 33 2000 . In a study published over 20 years ago van Sande et al. Urol. Res. 9 241 244 1981 examined lactoferrin protein levels in human benign prostatic hypertrophy samples. They also detected low levels of lactoferrin protein in 3 carcinoma samples. However we are the first to report the consistent and significant under expression of LTF mRNA in prostate cancer epithelial cells from a large number of patient samples. The observed under expression of LTF mRNA in such a statistically significant sample size indicates that under expression of LTF is a useful diagnostic marker for prostate cancer.

In one experiment when screened using the Affymetrix GeneChip CaP tumor cells exhibited upregulated AMACR expression in comparison to matched benign cells. In this studied patient cohort n 73 AMACR was upregulated in tumor compared to matched benign prostate epithelium in 89.04 of the patients 65 of 73 while ERG was upregulated in 78.08 57 of 73 . When these two markers were combined we observed a 100 CaP detection rate under the criteria that at least one marker was upregulated in the studied patient cohort 73 of 73 . These data indicate that the combination of ERG and AMACR screening provides a highly accurate tool for CaP detection.

In another experiment 96.4 of patients showed upregulation of either the ERG or AMACR gene in laser microdissected matched tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells from 55 CaP patients . Similarly 96.4 of patients showed upregulation of either the ERG or DD3 gene . When the expression data for the ERG AMACR and DD3 genes was combined 98.2 of the CaP patients showed upregulation of at least one of the three genes in tumor cells . Thus the combination of ERG AMACR and DD3 screening also provides a highly accurate tool for CaP detection.

In yet another experiment validation by QRT PCR TaqMan in microdissected tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells of 20 CaP patients confirmed a consistent tumor associated under expression of LTF in 100 of patients 20 of 20 . Further validation studies by QRT PCR in microdissected tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells of 103 CaP patients were consistent with the initial results showing tumor associated under expression in 76 of patients 78 of 103 .

In one embodiment the present invention comprises a method of CaP diagnosis comprising screening biological samples for CaP cell specific gene expression signatures. In particular the invention comprises screening for at least one of the CaP cell specific genes listed in Tables 1 6 particularly the ERG gene the AMACR gene the LTF gene or a combination of the ERG gene and the AMACR genes. The invention also comprises methods of diagnosing CaP comprising screening biological samples for expression of the ERG and DD3 genes or a combination of the ERG DD3 and AMACR genes.

In a further embodiment the present invention comprises a method of CaP diagnosis comprising screening biological samples for CaP cell specific gene expression signatures using methods known in the art including for example immunohistochemistry ELISA in situ RNA hybridization and any oligonucletide amplification procedure known or later developed including PCR including QRT PCR transcription mediated amplification TMA nucleic acid sequence based amplification NASBA self sustained sequence replication 3SR ligase chain reaction LCR strand displacement amplification SDA and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification LAMP . See e.g. Mullis U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 202 Erlich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 197 563 Walker et al. 20 1691 1696 1992 Fahy et al. PCR 1 25 33 1991 Kacian et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 491 Kacian et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 480 784 Davey et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 554 517 Birkenmeyer et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 930 Marshall et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 686 272 Walker U.S. Pat. No. 5 712 124 Notomi et al. European Patent Application No. 1 020 534 A1 Dattagupta et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 214 587 and HH. L. NAAT ADD 1997 . Each of the foregoing amplification references is hereby incorporated by reference herein. In particular the invention comprises generating antibodies to CaP cell specific genes including ERG AMACR LTF and DD3 for use in a immunohistochemistry assay. Other known diagnostic assays may be used to detect gene expression.

In a specific embodiment the present invention comprises a method of diagnosing CaP comprising screening biological samples for expression of the ERG and AMACR genes the ERG and DD3 genes or the ERG AMACR and DD3 genes or the LTF gene using methods known in the art including for example immunohistochemistry ELISA in situ hybridization PCR including QRT PCR transcription mediated amplification TMA nucleic acid sequence based amplification NASBA self sustained sequence replication 3SR ligase chain reaction LCR strand displacement amplification SDA and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification LAMP .

ERG LTF or AMACR polypeptides their fragments or other derivatives or analogs thereof may be used as immunogens in order to generate antibodies that specifically bind such immunogens. Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal chimeric single chain and Fab fragments. In a specific embodiment antibodies to a human ERG LTF or AMACR protein are produced. Antibodies can then be used in standard diagnostic assays to detect the protein produced by the desired gene.

Various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an ERG LTF or AMACR protein or derivative or analog. In a particular embodiment rabbit polyclonal antibodies to an epitope of a ERG LTF or AMACR protein can be obtained. For the production of antibody various host animals can be immunized by injection with the native ERG LTF or AMACR protein or a synthetic version or derivative e.g. fragment thereof including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and corynebacterium parvum.

For preparation of monoclonal antibodies directed toward a ERG LTF or AMACR protein sequence or analog thereof any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture may be used. For example the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler et al 1975 Nature 256 495 497 as well as the trioma technique the human B cell hybridoma technique Kozbor et al. 1983 Immunology Today 4 72 and the EBV hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies Cole et al. 1985 Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . According to the invention human antibodies may be used and can be obtained by using human hybridomas Cote et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80 2026 2030 or by transforming human B cells with EBV virus in vitro Cole et al. 1985 Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss pp. 77 96 . According to the invention techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. 1984 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81 6851 6855 Neuberger et al. 1984 Nature 312 604 608 Takeda et al. 1985 Nature 314 452 454 by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule specific for ERG LTF or AMACR together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used such antibodies are within the scope of this invention.

Techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 can be used to produce ERG LTF or AMACR specific single chain antibodies. An additional embodiment of the invention utilizes the techniques described for the construction of Fab expression libraries Huse et al. 1989 Science 246 1275 1281 to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity for ERG LTF or AMACR proteins derivatives or analogs.

Antibody fragments which contain the idiotype of the molecule can be generated by known techniques. For example such fragments include but are not limited to the F ab fragment which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule the Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab fragment the Fab fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent and Fv fragments including single chain Fv scFv fragments.

In the production of antibodies screening for the desired antibody can be accomplished by techniques known in the art e.g. ELISA. For example to select antibodies that recognize a specific domain of a ERG LTF or AMACR protein one may assay generated hybridomas for a product which binds to a ERG LTF or AMACR fragment containing such domain.

A second aspect of the invention provides for use of the expression profiles resulting from these methods in diagnostic methods including but not limited to characterizing the treatment response to any therapy correlating expression profiles with clinico pathologic features distinguishing indolent prostate cancers from those with a more aggressive phenotype e.g. moderate risk versus high risk analyzing tumor specimens of patients treated by radical prostate surgery to help define prognosis screening candidate genes for the development of a polynucleotide array for use as a blood test for improved prostate cancer detection and identifying further genes that may serve as biomarkers for response to treatment to screen drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

As will be readily appreciated by persons having skill in the art the ERG LTF DD3 and or the AMACR nucleic acid sequences described herein can easily be synthesized directly on a support or pre synthesized polynucleotide probes may be affixed to a support as described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 744 305 5 837 832 and 5 861 242 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Such arrays may be used to detect specific nucleic acid sequences contained in a target cell or sample as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 744 305 5 837 832 and 5 861 242 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. More specifically in the present invention these arrays may be used in methods for the diagnosis or prognosis of prostate cancer such as by assessing the expression profiles of genes in biological samples. In a preferred embodiment computer models may be developed for the analysis of expression profiles. Moreover such polynucleotide arrays are useful in methods to screen drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. In these screening methods the polynucleotide arrays are used to analyze how drugs affect the expression of the ERG LTF AMACR and or DD3 genes.

The invention provides for treatment or prevention of various diseases and disorders by administration of a therapeutic compound termed herein therapeutic . Therapeutics include but are not limited to ERG or LTF proteins and analogs and derivatives including fragments thereof e.g. as described herein above nucleic acids encoding the ERG or LTF proteins analogs or derivatives ERG or LTF antisense nucleic acids ERG or LTF dominant negative mutants siRNA against ERG or LTF ERG or LTF antibodies and ERG or LTF agonists and antagonists. ERG or LTF agonists and antagonists including small molecules can be identified using the methods disclosed in this application or any standard screening assay to identify agents that modulate ERG or LTF expression or function particularly in prostate cancer cells. For example ERG or LTF expression or function can be readily detected e.g. by obtaining a biological sample from a patient e.g. a tissue sample e.g. from biopsy tissue a blood sample or a urine sample and assaying it in vitro for mRNA or protein levels structure and or activity of the expressed ERG or LTF mRNA or protein. Many methods standard in the art can be employed including but not limited to kinase assays immunoassays to detect and or visualize ERG or LTF protein e.g. Western blot immunoprecipitation followed by SDS PAGE immunocytochemistry etc. and or hybridization assays to detect ERG or LTF expression by detecting and or visualizing ERG or LTF mRNA e.g. Northern assays dot blots in situ hybridization PCR including RT PCR TMA NASAB 3SR LCR SDA LAMP etc. .

Disorders involving hyperproliferation of cells are treated or prevented by administration of a therapeutic that antagonizes reduces or inhibits ERG function or expression or enhances LTF function or expression. In certain embodiments ERG function is inhibited by use of ERG antisense nucleic acids. The present invention provides the therapeutic or prophylactic use of nucleic acids of at least 10 15 100 200 500 1000 1500 2000 or 2500 contiguous nucleotides in antisense to any of the ERG nucleotides described herein. In a particular embodiment the ERG antisense nucleic acid comprises at least 10 15 100 200 500 1000 1500 2000 or 2500 contiguous nucleotides in antisense orientation to the ERG nucleotide sequence. An ERG antisense nucleic acid as used herein refers to a nucleic acid capable of hybridizing under defined conditions to a portion of an ERG nucleic acid by virtue of some sequence complementarity. The antisense nucleic acid may be complementary to a coding and or noncoding region of an ERG nucleic acid. Such antisense nucleic acids have utility as therapeutics that inhibit ERG function and can be used in the treatment or prevention of disorders as described herein.

The antisense nucleic acids of the invention can be oligonucleotides that are double stranded or single stranded RNA or DNA or a modification or derivative thereof which can be directly administered to a cell or which can be produced intracellularly by transcription of exogenously introduced coding sequences.

The dominant negative mutants of the invention can be produced by expression plasmids containing a nucleic acid encoding a non functional domain of ERG such as the DNA binding domain of ERG. These expression plasmids can be introduced into a target cell or tissue and can induce tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis by acting as a dominant negative form against the wild type ERG transcription factors influencing cell hyperproliferation Oikawa Cancer Sci 2004 95 626 33 .

RNA interference can be achieved using siRNA against the ERG gene. The siRNA is a short double stranded RNA molecule of about 18 25 nucleotides that comprises a nucleotide sequence complementary to a region of the target gene. The siRNA can be introduced into a target cell or tissue for example using an expression plasmid where it interferes with the translation of the ERG gene. RNA interference techniques can be carried out using known methods as described for example in published U.S. Patent Applications 20040192626 20040181821 and 20030148519 each of which is incorporated by reference.

Therapeutics which are useful according to this embodiment of the invention for treatment of a disorder may be selected by testing for biological activity in promoting the survival or differentiation of cells. For example in a specific embodiment relating to cancer therapy including therapy of prostate cancer a therapeutic decreases proliferation of tumor cells. These effects can be measured as described in the Examples or using any other method standard in the art.

In specific embodiments malignancy or dysproliferative changes such as metaplasias and dysplasias or hyperproliferative disorders are treated or prevented in the prostate.

The therapeutics of the invention that antagonize ERG activity can also be administered to treat premalignant conditions and to prevent progression to a neoplastic or malignant state including but not limited to those disorders described herein such as prostate cancer.

In a specific embodiment nucleic acids comprising a sequence encoding an ERG or LTF protein or functional derivative thereof are administered to promote ERG or LTF function by way of gene therapy. Alternatively nucleic acids comprising an antisense ERG sequence are administered to antagonize ERG expression or function. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration of a nucleic acid to a subject.

Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. For specific protocols see Morgan 2001 Gene Therapy Protocols 2ed. Humana Press. For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy see Goldspiel et al. 1993 Clinical Pharmacy 12 488 505 Wu et al. 1991 Biotherapy 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 1993 Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32 573 596 Mulligan 1993 Science 260 926 932 and Morgan et al. 1993 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62 191 217 May 1993 TIBTECH 11 5 155 215 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 2004 Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons NY and Kriegler 1990 Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY.

In one embodiment the therapeutic comprises an ERG or LTF nucleic acid or antisense ERG nucleic acid that is part of a vector. In particular such a nucleic acid has a regulatory sequence such as a promoter operably linked to the ERG or LTF coding region or antisense molecule said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment a nucleic acid molecule is used in which the ERG or LTF coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the ERG or LTF nucleic acid Koller et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86 8932 8935 Zijlstra et al. 1989 Nature 342 435 438 .

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the desired nucleic acids such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by the appropriate inducer of transcription.

Delivery of the nucleic acid into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vector or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acid in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid is directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular e.g. by infection using a defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vector see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 which is incorporated herein by reference or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic DuPont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering it in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu et al. 1987 J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 . In another embodiment a nucleic acid ligand complex can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Pubs. WO 92 06180 WO 92 22635 WO92 20316 WO93 14188 WO 93 20221 . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86 8932 8935 Zijlstra et al. 1989 Nature 342 435 438 .

In a specific embodiment a viral vector that contains an ERG or LTF nucleic acid is used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. 1993 Meth. Enzymol. 217 581 599 . These retroviral vectors have been modified to delete retroviral sequences that are not necessary for packaging of the viral genome and integration into host cell DNA. The ERG or LTF nucleic acid to be used in gene therapy is cloned into the vector which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. 1994 Biotherapy 6 291 302 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the MDRL gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. 1994 J. Clin. Invest. 93 644 651 Kiem et al. 1994 Blood 83 1467 1473 Salmons et al. 1993 Hum. Gene Ther. 4 129 141 and Grossman et al. 1993 Curr. Opin. Gen. Devel. 3 110 114.

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky et al. 1993 Curr. Opin. Gen. Devel. 3 499 503 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. 1994 Hum. Gene Ther. 5 3 10 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. 1991 Science 252 431 434 Rosenfeld et al. 1992 Cell 68 143 155 and Mastrangeli et al. 1993 J. Clin. Invest. 91 225 234.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. 1993 Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204 289 300 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler et al. 1993 Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 618 Cohen et al. 1993 Meth. Enzymol. 217 618 644 Cline 1985 Pharmac. Ther. 29 69 92 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. In one preferred embodiment epithelial cells are injected e.g. subcutaneously. In another embodiment recombinant skin cells may be applied as a skin graft onto the patient. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells may be administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc. In certain embodiments the cells used for gene therapy are autologous to the patient.

In one embodiment an ERG or LTF nucleic acid or antisense molecule is introduced into the cells such that it is expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention. Such stem cells include but are not limited to hematopoietic stem cells HSC stem cells of epithelial tissues such as the skin and the lining of the gut embryonic heart muscle cells liver stem cells PCT Pub. WO 94 08598 and neural stem cells Stemple et al. 1992 Cell 71 973 985 .

Epithelial stem cells ESCs or keratinocytes can be obtained from tissues such as the skin and the lining of the gut by known procedures Rheinwald 1980 Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 . In stratified epithelial tissue such as the skin renewal occurs by mitosis of stem cells within the germinal layer the layer closest to the basal lamina. Stem cells within the lining of the gut provide for a rapid renewal rate of this tissue. ESCs or keratinocytes obtained from the skin or lining of the gut of a patient or donor can be grown in tissue culture Rheinwald 1980 Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 Pittelkow et al. 1986 Mayo Clinic. Proc. 61 771 . If the ESCs are provided by a donor a method for suppression of host versus graft reactivity e.g. irradiation drug or antibody administration to promote moderate immunosuppression can also be used.

With respect to hematopoietic stem cells HSC any technique which provides for the isolation propagation and maintenance in vitro of HSC can be used in this embodiment of the invention. Techniques by which this may be accomplished include a the isolation and establishment of HSC cultures from bone marrow cells isolated from the future host or a donor or b the use of previously established long term HSC cultures which may be allogeneic or xenogeneic. Non autologous HSC may be used in conjunction with a method of suppressing transplantation immune reactions of the future host patient. In a particular embodiment human bone marrow cells can be obtained from the posterior iliac crest by needle aspiration see e.g. Kodo et al. 1984 J. Clin. Invest. 73 1377 1384 . In one embodiment the HSCs can be made highly enriched or in substantially pure form. This enrichment can be accomplished before during or after long term culturing and can be done by any techniques known in the art. Long term cultures of bone marrow cells can be established and maintained by using for example modified Dexter cell culture techniques Dexter et al. 1977 J. Cell Physiol. 91 335 or Witlock Witte culture techniques Witlock et al. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79 3608 3612 .

The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of an ERG or LTF therapeutic including ERG or LTF nucleic acids sense or antisense or ERG or LTF polypeptides of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as described below.

Compositions comprising an effective amount of a polypeptide of the present invention in combination with other components such as a physiologically acceptable diluent carrier or excipient are provided herein. The polypeptides can be formulated according to known methods used to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions. They can be combined in admixture either as the sole active material or with other known active materials suitable for a given indication with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents e.g. saline Tris HCl acetate and phosphate buffered solutions preservatives e.g. thimerosal benzyl alcohol parabens emulsifiers solubilizers adjuvants and or carriers. Suitable formulations for pharmaceutical compositions include those described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16ed. Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1980.

Such compositions will influence the physical state solubility stability rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance and are thus chosen according to the intended application.

The compositions of the invention can be administered in any suitable manner e.g. topically parenterally or by inhalation. The term parenteral includes injection e.g. by subcutaneous intravenous or intramuscular routes also including localized administration e.g. at a site of disease or injury. Sustained release from implants is also contemplated. One skilled in the art will recognize that suitable dosages will vary depending upon such factors as the nature of the disorder to be treated the patient s body weight age and general condition and the route of administration. Preliminary doses can be determined according to animal tests and the scaling of dosages for human administration is performed according to art accepted practices.

Compositions comprising nucleic acids of the invention in physiologically acceptable formulations e.g. to be used for gene therapy are also contemplated.

The compounds may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route including intraventricular and intrathecal injection intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter for example attached to a reservoir such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.

In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example local infusion during surgery topical application e.g. in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery by injection by means of a catheter a suppository an implant wherein the said implant is of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers. In one embodiment administration can be by direct injection at the site or former site of a malignant tumor or neoplastic or pre neoplastic tissue.

ERG LTF and or AMACR proteins analogues derivatives and fragments thereof and antibodies thereto ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR nucleic acids and their complementary and homologous sequences and antibodies thereto including anti ERG anti DD3 anti LTF and or anti AMACR antibodies have uses in diagnostics. Such molecules can be used in assays such as immunoassays to detect prognose diagnose or monitor various conditions diseases and disorders affecting ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR expression or monitor the treatment thereof particularly cancer and more particularly prostate cancer. In particular such an immunoassay is carried out by a method comprising contacting a sample derived from an individual with an anti ERG anti LTF anti DD3 and or anti AMACR antibody directed against either a protein product or a nucliec acid under conditions such that specific binding can occur and detecting or measuring the amount of any specific binding by the antibody. In one embodiment such binding of antibody in tissue sections can be used to detect aberrant ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR localization or aberrant e.g. high low or absent levels of ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR. In a specific embodiment antibody to ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR can be used to assay in a biological sample e.g. tissue blood or urine sample for the presence of ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR where an aberrant level of ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR is an indication of a diseased condition such as cancer including for example prostate cancer.

Any biological sample in which it is desired to detect an oligonucloetide or polypeptide of interest can be used including tissue cells blood lymph semen and urine. The biological sample is preferably derived from prostate tissue blood or urine. The tissue sample comprises cells obtained from a patient. The cells may be found in a prostate tissue sample collected for example by a prostate tissue biopsy or histology section or a bone marrow biopsy. The blood sample can include whole blood plasma serum or any derivative thereof including for example circulating cells such as prostate cells isolated from the blood sample or nucleic acid or protein obtained from the isolated cells. Blood may contain prostate cells particularly when the prostate cells are cancerous and more particularly when the prostate cancer metastasizes and is shed into the blood. Similarly the urine sample can be whole urine or any derivative thereof including for example cells such as prostate cells obtained from the urine.

The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as Western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA immunoprecipitation assays immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few.

ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR genes and related nucleic acid sequences and subsequences including complementary sequences can also be used in hybridization assays. ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR nucleic acid sequences or subsequences thereof comprising about at least 8 15 20 50 100 250 or 500 nucleotides can be used as hybridization probes. Hybridization assays can be used to detect prognose diagnose or monitor conditions disorders or disease states associated with aberrant changes in ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR expression and or activity as described above. In particular such a hybridization assay is carried out by a method comprising contacting a sample containing nucleic acid with a nucleic acid probe capable of hybridizing under defined conditions preferably under high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes to an ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR nucleic acid and detecting i.e measuring either qualitatively or quantitatively the degree of the resulting hybridization. As described herein any nucleic acid amplification procedure including PCR RT PCR TMA NASBA 3SR LCR SDA and LAMP can be used to detect the presence of the ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR gene and or the level of its mRNA expression.

In some applications probes exhibiting at least some degree of self complementarity are desirable to facilitate detection of probe target duplexes in a test sample without first requiring the removal of unhybridized probe prior to detection. Molecular torch probes are a type of self complementary probes that are disclosed by Becker et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 361 945. The molecular torch probes disclosed Becker et al. have distinct regions of self complementarity referred to as the target binding domain and the target closing domain which are connected by a joining region and which hybridize to one another under predetermined hybridization assay conditions. When exposed to denaturing conditions the complementary regions which may be fully or partially complementary of the molecular torch probe melt leaving the target binding domain available for hybridization to a target sequence when the predetermined hybridization assay conditions are restored. And when exposed to strand displacement conditions a portion of the target sequence binds to the target binding domain and displaces the target closing domain from the target binding domain. Molecular torch probes are designed so that the target binding domain favors hybridization to the target sequence over the target closing domain. The target binding domain and the target closing domain of a molecular torch probe include interacting labels e.g. luminescent quencher positioned so that a different signal is produced when the molecular torch probe is self hybridized as opposed to when the molecular torch probe is hybridized to a target nucleic acid thereby permitting detection of probe target duplexes in a test sample in the presence of unhybridized probe having a viable label or labels associated therewith.

Another example of detection probes having self complementarity are the molecular beacon probes disclosed by Tyagi et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5 925 517. Molecular beacon probes include nucleic acid molecules having a target complement sequence an affinity pair or nucleic acid arms holding the probe in a closed conformation in the absence of a target nucleic acid sequence and a label pair that interacts when the probe is in a closed conformation. Hybridization of the target nucleic acid and the target complement sequence separates the members of the affinity pair thereby shifting the probe to an open confirmation. The shift to the open confirmation is detectable due to reduced interaction of the label pair which may be for example a fluorophore and quencher such as DABCYL and EDANS.

By way of example ERG LTF AMACR or DD3 hybridization probes can comprise a nucleic acid having a contiguous stretch of at least about 8 15 20 50 100 250 500 750 1000 1250 or 1500 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5 or a sequence complementary thereto. Such contiguous fragments of SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5 may also contain at least one mutation so long as the mutant sequence retains the capacity to hybridize to SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 5 under low or high stringency conditions preferably under high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes .

In specific embodiments diseases and disorders involving hyperproliferation of cells such as cancers including for example prostate cancer can be diagnosed or their suspected presence can be screened for or a predisposition to develop such disorders can be predicted by detecting levels of the ERG LTF and or AMACR protein ERG DD3 and or AMACR RNA or ERG DD3 and or AMACR functional activity or by detecting mutations in ERG DD3 LTF and or AMACR RNA DNA or protein e.g. translocations in ERG LFT DD3 or AMACR nucleic acids truncations in the ERG LFT DD3 or AMACR gene or protein changes in nucleotide or amino acid sequence relative to wild type ERG LTF DD3 or AMACR that cause increased or decreased expression or activity of ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR. By way of example levels of ERG LTF and or AMACR protein can be detected by immunoassay levels of ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR mRNA can be detected by hybridization assays e.g. Northern blots dot blots or any nucleic acid amplification procedure including PCR RT PCR TMA NASBA 3SR LCR SDA and LAMP translocations and point mutations in ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR nucleic acids can be detected by Southern blotting RFLP analysis any nucleic acid amplification procedure including PCR RT PCR TMA NASBA 3SR LCR SDA LAMP sequencing of the ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR genomic DNA or cDNA obtained from the patient etc.

In one embodiment levels of the ERG DD3 LTF and or AMACR mRNA or protein in a subject sample are detected or measured and compared to the mRNA or protein expression levels of the corresponding gene in a control sample or to a standard numerical value or range. For example increased expression levels of ERG DD3 and or AMACR or decreased levels of LTF relative to a matched normal tissue sample indicate that the subject has a malignancy or hyperproliferative disorder including for example prostate cancer or a predisposition to develop the same. Other appropriate controls include other noncancerous samples from the subject samples obtained from a different subject without cancer or other cancer specific markers. For example in prostate cancer a prostate cell specific marker such as PSA can be used as a control to compare and or normalize expression levels of other genes such as ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR. In one embodiment a method of diagnosing cancer such as prostate cancer comprises obtaining a biological sample from a subject e.g. a tissue sample e.g. from biopsy tissue a blood sample or a urine sample determining the expression level of a ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR gene and or ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR activity in the samples and diagnosing or prognosing cancer in said subject. In further embodiments the expression level of the ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR gene and or ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR activity is determined by Southern blotting Northern blotting Western blotting ELISA any nucleic acid amplification procedure including PCR RT PCR TMA NASBA 3SR LCR SDA and LAMP or other techniques as described herein or known in the art. Without limiting the instant invention increased or decreased expression of at least two times as compared to the control sample indicates the presence of prostate cancer or a higher predisposition to developing prostate cancer.

Another aspect of the invention provides a means for monitoring a response to hormonal therapy by evaluating the expression profiles of the ERG gene alone or in combination with the AMACR and or DD3 genes and or LTF genes and correlating these profiles with the clinical signs of the disease.

Kits for diagnostic use are also provided. A kit comprises an anti ERG gene antibody or an antibody directed against the ERG protein and or an anti AMACR gene antibody or an antibody directed against the AMACR protein and or an anti DD3 gene antibody and or and an anti LTF gene antibody or an antibody directed against the LTF protein which can be optionally detectably labeled. A kit is also provided that comprises a nucleic acid probe capable of hybridizing under defined conditions preferably under high stringency hybridization conditions e.g. hybridization for 48 hours at 65 C. in 6 SSC followed by a wash in 0.1 SSX at 50 C. for 45 minutes to ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR nucleic acid. In a specific embodiment a kit comprises at least a pair of primers e.g. each in the size range of at least about 6 17 30 or 60 nucleotides that are capable of priming amplification by any nucleic acid amplification procedure including e.g. PCR RT PCR TMA NASBA 3SR LCR SDA LAMP of the ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR gene or a fragment thereof. A kit can comprise a predetermined amount of a purified ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR protein or nucleic acid for use e.g. as a standard or control. The kit can also comprise one or more components for detecting the nucleic acid probe including components described herein or known in the art.

For example an ERG and or LTF nucleic acid can be affixed to the support with or without other nucleic acids. In a specific embodiment the support comprises at least an ERG nucleic acid and an AMACR nucleic acid or at least an ERG nucleic acid and a DD3 nucleic acid. In another embodiment the support comprises at least an ERG nucleic acid an AMACR nucleic acid and a DD3 nucleic acid. This support can be used as part of a kit for detecting cancer such as prostate cancer. These kits can further comprise at least a pair of primers e.g. each in the size range of at least about 6 17 30 or 60 nucleotides that are capable of priming amplification by any nucleic acid amplification procedure including e.g. PCR RT PCR TMA NASBA 3SR LCR SDA LAMP of the ERG LTF DD3 and or AMACR gene or a fragment thereof.

Specimens were obtained under an IRB approved protocol from patients treated by radical prostatectomy RP at Walter Reed Army Medical Center WRAMC . From over 300 patients two groups were selected which had prostate tumors with either moderate MR or high risk HR of disease progression after RP. The HR group had PSA recurrence Gleason score 8 9 T3c stage seminal vesicle invasion and poorly differentiated tumor cells the MR group had no PSA recurrence Gleason score 6 7 T2a T3b stage no seminal vesicle invasion and well to moderately differentiated tumor cells. LCM compatible specimens were selected from age and race matched HR or MR patients with no family history of CaP.

Normal and cancer cells were laser capture microdissected LCM from OCT embedded and Hematoxylin eosin H E stained frozen prostate sections of radical prostatectomy specimens 2000 laser shots for one sample . Laser capture microdissection LCM facilitates the isolation of morphologically defined homogenous cell populations from complex tissues by selectively adhering the cells of interest to a transparent film with focused pulses of low energy infrared laser under a microscope. Emmert Buck et al. Science 1996 274 5289 921 922 Schutz et al. Nat Biotechnol 1998 16 8 737 742.

Total RNA was isolated from the LCM samples with the MicroRNA kit Stratagene La Jolla Calif. quantified using RiboGreen dye Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. and VersaFluor fluorimeter BioRad Hercules Calif. and quality tested by RT PCR using NKX3.1 and GAPDH primers. Linear RNA amplification was performed using RiboAmp RNA amplification kit Arcturus Mountain View Calif. . Precisely 2 nanograms of total RNA from LCM derived epithelial cells of normal as well as tumor tissue from each patient was used for the first round of amplification. During the second round of amplification after cDNA synthesis and purification the samples were biotinylated during in vitro transcription which was used for the GeneChip analysis.

Linearly amplified aRNA was hybridized to high density oligonucleotide human genome array HG U133A array Affymetrix Santa Clara Calif. USA . The array contains 22 283 probe sets about 18 000 of which represent well annotated genes while the remainder represent various expressed sequence tags EST and hypothetical genes. Biotinylation was carried out using aRNA by in vitro transcription using MEGA script T7 in vitro Transcription Kit Ambion Austin Tex. USA cDNA and biotinylated UTP and biotinylated CTP ENZO Farmingdale N.Y. USA 34 . The biotin labeled cRNA was purified using the QIAGEN RNeasy spin columns QIAGEN Valencia Calif. following the manufacturer s protocol. The biotin labeled cRNA was fragmented in a 40 l reaction mixture containing 40 mM Tris acetate pH 8.1 100 mM potassium acetate and 30 mM magnesium acetate incubated at 94 C. for 35 minutes and then put on ice.

The biotin labeled and fragmented aRNA was hybridized to the HG U133A array. Briefly a 220 l hybridization solution consisting of 1M NaCl 10 mM Tris pH 7.6 0.005 Triton X 100 50 pM control Oligo B2 5 bioGTCAAGATGCTACCGTTCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 6 Affymetrix the control cRNA cocktail of Bio B 150 pM Bio C 500 pM Bio D 2.5 nM and Cre X 10 nM American Type Tissue Collection Manassas Va. and Lofstrand Labs Gaithersburg Md. 0.1 mg ml herring sperm DNA and 0.05 g l of the fragmented labeled sample cRNA was heated to 95 C. for 35 min. cooled to 40 C. and clarified by centrifugation. Hybridization was at 42 C. in a rotisserie hybridization oven Model 320 Affymetrix at 60 rpm for 16 hours. Following hybridization the GeneChip arrays were washed 10 times at 25 C. with 6 SSPE T buffer 1 M NaCl 0.006 M EDTA and 0.06 M NaPO 0.005 Triton X 100 pH 7.6 using the automated fluidics station protocol. GeneChip arrays were incubated at 50 C. in 0.5 SSPE T 0.005 Triton X 100 for 20 minutes at 60 rpm in the rotisserie oven. GeneChip arrays were stained for 15 minutes at room temperature and at 60 rpm with streptavidin phycoerythrin Molecular Probes Inc. Eugene Oreg. stain solution at a final concentration of 10 g ml in 6 SSPE T buffer and 1.0 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin Sigma . GeneChip arrays were washed twice at room temperature with 6 SSPE T buffer and then were scanned with the HP GeneArray Scanner Hewlett Packard Santa Clara Calif. controlled by GeneChip 3.1 Software Affymetrix .

Affymetrix GeneChip Microarray Analysis Software version 3.1 and Affymetrix Micro DB and Data Mining Tool version 2.0 Affymetrix Microsoft Excel 2000 Microsoft Seattle Wash. and Statistica version 4.1 Stat Soft Inc. Tulsa Okla. were used. In the Affymetrix system the average difference fluorescence is the average of the difference between every perfect match probe cell and its control mismatch probe cell and is directly related to the level of expression of a transcript. A comparative file indicates the relative change in abundance fold change for each transcript between a baseline and an experimental sample. For further detail and advanced bioinformatic analysis we used the Microarray Data Analysis software from NHGRI and the GeneSpring software Silicon Genetics Calif. .

For clustering analysis National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI Microarray Data Analysis software was used which partitioned the samples of the high risk and moderate risk groups into well separated and homogeneous groups based on the statistical behavior of their genes expression. To achieve the objective of clustering each of the groups all pair wise similarities between samples were evaluated and then grouped via the average linkage algorithm. Pearson correlation coefficient or Euclidean distance were typically used to quantify the similarity. Unsupervised hierarchical and or non hierarchical clustering was also performed using the same distance matrix.

Using a matrix of Euclidean distance measurements from complete pair wise comparison of all the prostate specimens a multidimensional scaling MDS method was performed using an implementation of MDS in the MATLAB package to determine the overall similarities and dissimilarities in gene expression profiles. A weighted gene analysis was performed to generate a subset of genes statistically significant in separating the high risk group from the moderate risk group.

Briefly for two different groups e.g. epithelium of high risk tumor and epithelium of moderate risk tumor with a given number of samples 25 and 25 the discriminative weight for each gene is determined by the formula w d kd kd where dis the Euclidean distance between two groups center to center or between cluster Euclidean distance dis the average Euclidean distance among all the epithelial samples of high risk group dis average Euclidean distance among all the epithelial samples of moderate risk group k 25 25 25 k 25 25 25 and is a small constant to ensure the denominator is never equal to zero. Genes were ranked according to their w values. Genes with high w values created greater separation between groups and denser compaction within the group. In other words the subset of genes with high w values have the most discriminative power to differentiate a high risk group from a moderate risk group and vice versa. Sample labels were randomly permuted and the w value was computed again for each gene to test the statistical significance of the discriminative weights. Genes with the most significant expression differences were selected by p values. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to verify the predictor model obtained from the supervised MDS analysis.

From this analysis specific genes were identified whose expression signature in tumor tissue varied from their expression signature in benign matched tissue. Genes with a p value of not more than 0.05 were selected and ranked by p value as shown in Tables 1 6.

We have tested the discriminatory potential of the genes that we obtained from our analysis on some independent data sets. Affymetrix oligonucleotide GeneChip Hum95Av2 data were obtained from Welsh et al. 2001 Singh et al. Genes from these data bases that correspond with the genes of our discriminatory list were selected and their tumor specific expression intensities and or tumor over normal ratio were used for an MDS analysis as described above in the data analysis section. MDS plots were obtained depicting the discriminatory capability of the genes on the independent data sets.

A class prediction analysis using distance based Multi Dimensional Scaling MDS was used to determine expression differences between tumor and benign epithelial cells in 18 patients with radical prostatectomy. All the genes that meet a minimum level of expression were included in the analysis. We used the normalized intensities of all the 18 tumor and 18 normal samples for a class prediction analysis by distance based MDS to determine differentiation between tumor and benign tissue specific gene expression profile among all the 18 patients. Using a matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients from the complete pair wise comparison of all the experiments we observed a significant overall difference in gene expression pattern between the tumor and benign tissue as displayed as a two dimensional MDS plot in . The position of the each tumor and benign samples is displayed in the MDS plot in two dimensional Euclidean space with the distance among the samples reflecting correlation among the samples in each individual group distance within the cluster and as well as reflecting distinct separation between the two groups center to center distance . The MDS plot was obtained from the top 200 genes obtained by 10 000 permutations of the tumor and benign intensities of 4566 genes. Out of these 200 genes that define the tumor specific alteration of gene expression 53 genes had higher expression in the tumor samples and the remaining 147 genes had higher expression in the benign samples. A partial list of genes that distinctly discriminate the tumor and benign samples from all the 18 patients is shown in Table 1. We also performed a hierarchical clustering analysis using the 200 discriminatory genes. The hierarchical clustering algorithm resulted in a hierarchical dendrogram that identified two major distinct clusters of 16 tumor samples and 17 benign samples .

Classification of CaP into HR and MR Groups Using the Ratio of Tumor over Benign Gene Expression Intensities

We used the tumor over benign gene expression intensity ratio T B ratio from the HR 9 patients and MR 9 patients groups for a class prediction analysis using distance based MDS method to determine if the 18 patients can be differentiated into the two patient groups. Pathological and clinical features of the 18 tumors used in our study were clearly distinguishable between the HR and MR groups. We observed a significant overall difference in expression pattern between the HR and MR groups. The distance between the samples reflects both the extent of correlation within each individual selected group distance within the cluster as well as distinct separation between the two selected groups center to center distance . The MDS plot obtained from top 200 genes by 10 000 permutations of the 4868 genes based on the T B ratio is shown in . Out of the top 200 genes of the MDS analysis 135 were over expressed in the HR group and 65 genes were over expressed in the MR group The top 50 genes with best p values identified by the T B ratio based MDS analysis discriminating the HR and MR groups are listed in . The approach we used for the interpretation of discrimination between the HR and MR groups was empirical. The weighted list of individual genes whose variance of change across all the tumor samples defines the boundary of a given cluster to predict a class that correlates with the pathological and clinical features of CaP. We also performed a hierarchical clustering to verify the results of the MDS analysis and also to test the potential of those 200 genes to predict class group HR and or MR using another approach of analysis. The resulting hierarchical dendrogram of TB ratio demonstrates that 9 samples of the HR group formed a very distinct and tight cluster as did the 9 samples of MR group .

MDS analysis was used to determine differentiation among 18 patients into HR and MR groups. An overall difference in tumor specific expression between the HR and MR groups is displayed as a two dimensional MDS plot . The MDS plot obtained from 10 000 permutations of the gene expression intensities of 4115 genes from the tumor samples of 18 patients differentiated them into HR and MR groups based on the selected top 200 genes . Out of this 200 genes 94 had higher expression in the HR groups and the remaining 106 genes had higher expression in the MR groups. We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis using the 200 discriminatory genes obtained from the supervised MDS analysis. The resulting hierarchical dendrogram of 18 tumor samples demonstrates that 9 tumor samples of the HR group and 9 tumor samples of the MR group were separated into two tight clusters. . The approach we utilized on the basis of the linear correlation of global gene expression in to obtain gene cluster interpretation to discriminate the HR and MR groups was empirical. Genes that discriminate the HR and MR groups are shown in Table 7.

We used a similar MDS and Cluster analysis as in the tumor versus tumor sample gene expression intensities for the normalized intensities of 9 benign samples of HR group and 9 benign samples of MR group for a class prediction. Strikingly the MDS plot of the benign samples depicted distinct separation between the HR and MR groups . We observed a significant overall difference in expression pattern between the HR and MR groups. The MDS plot obtained from the top 200 genes by 10 000 permutations of the 3358 genes from the benign versus benign intensities . Out of this 200 genes 61 were over expressed in benign samples of the HR groups and the remaining 139 genes were over expressed in the MR groups. The weighted list of individual genes whose variance of expression alteration across all the normal samples depicts the capability of a given cluster to predict classification. The hierarchical clustering algorithm identified a similar major cluster of the 9 benign samples of the HR group and a cluster of 9 benign samples of the MR group.

The weighted gene analysis by distance based supervised multidimensional scaling method we used depicted in utilizing the gene expression ratio of tumor and benign intensities gene expression intensities of tumor samples and as well as normal for obtaining a weighted list of individual genes whose variance of change across all the tumor and benign samples distinctly delineate the boundary of a given cluster to predict a class that correlates with the pathological and clinical features of CaP.

In silico analysis for the predicted classifier was carried out using two independent data sets. The HR and MR groups were selected on the basis of Gleason score as that was the only criterion available for these data. At least 200 genes were extracted from all the MDS analysis see methods for detail description . This subset of 200 classifier genes were found in the data of Welsh et al. 2001 and Sing et al. 2002. Exactly similar MDS analysis p

To further validate the expression alterations of genes identified by GeneChip analysis with an indicated biological relevance to prostate cancer primers and probes were obtained for real time PCR analysis using AMACR and GSTP1. These genes were chosen for validation purposes because it has been reported previously by several investigators that AMACR is elevated and GSTP1 decreased in CaP. Each sample demonstrated a unique pattern of down regulation of GSTP1 gene in 18 of 20 samples as well as up regulation of AMACR the other two samples did show significant change fold change less than 1.5 .

One ng of total RNA samples from paired tumor and normal specimens was reverse transcripted using Omnisensecript RT kit Qiagene Valencia Calif. according to the manufacturer s protocol.

Quantitative gene expression analysis was performed using TaqMan Master Mix Reagent and an ABI prism 7700 Sequence Detection System PE Applied Biosystems Foster Calif. . All sets of primer and probe for tested genes were Assays on Demand Gene expression products obtained from PE Applied Biosystems. The expression of house keeping gene GAPDH was simultaneously analyzed as the endogenous control of same batch of cDNA and the target gene expression of each sample was normalized to GAPDH. For each PCR run a master mix was prepared on ice with 1 TaqMan Master Mix 1 target gene primer probe and 1 GAPDH primer probe. Two microliters of each diluted cDNA sample was added to 28 l of PCR master mix. The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 C. for 10 minutes and 50 cycles at 95 C. for 15 seconds and 60 C. for 1 minute. RNA samples without reverse transcription were included as the negative control in each assay. All assays were performed in duplicate. Results were plotted as average C threshold cycle of duplicated samples. The relative gene expression level was presented as Fold Change of tumor versus matched normal cells which is calculated as Fold change 2 where Cmeans normalized Cvalue of target genes to GAPDH.

The Affymetrix GeneChip probe set 213541 s at and TaqMan probes used in the experiments described above recognize a region specific for both ERG1 and ERG2 isoforms but exclude isoforms 3 to 9. Although other primers and probes could be used by way of example TaqMan primers and probe recognizing both ERG1 and ERG2 but not other ERG isoforms were as follows 

To further distinguish between these two ERG isoforms the expression of the ERG1 and ERG2 isoforms were tested in PC3 cells and in normal prostate tissue pooled prostate RNA from 20 men Clontech as well as in microdissected tumor and normal prostate epithelial cells from 5 CaP patients data not shown . Only ERG1 was expressed in the prostate cells and in PC3 cells. ERG2 expression was not detectable. A TaqMan QRT PCR probe and primers were designed that specifically recognize only the ERG1 isoform . Although other primers and probes could be used by way of example we designed TaqMan primers and probes recognizing only the ERG1 isoform as follows 

ERG1 expression was determined in 228 RNA specimens from microdissected matched tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells of 114 CaP patients. Overall 62.4 of the 114 CaP patients analyzed had significant over expression of ERG1 isoform in their tumor cells i.e. greater than 2 fold ERG1 expression in tumor versus benign cells while 16.6 of CaP patients had no detectable ERG1 expression 15.0 had under expression of ERG1 less than 0.5 fold difference in ERG1 expression in tumor versus benign cells and 6.0 had no significant difference 0.5 to 2 fold difference in ERG1 expression between tumor versus benign cells .

In a further study ERG expression was analyzed in 82 CaP patients. Using the TaqMan primers and probes discussed above we observed tumor associated over expression of ERG1 isoform 1 only and ERG isoforms 1 and 2 in 63.4 and 72.0 of the patients respectively. Therefore ERG1 isoform specific expression may actually reflect an underestimate of the overall ERG expression in CaP.

Since the ERG1 tumor versus benign expression ratio data did not have normal distribution the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used to analyze its relationship with various clinico pathologic features as shown in Table 8.

As shown in Table 8 95 CaP patients with detectable ERG1 expression were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test. N represents the number of CaP patients falling into the indicated clinical factor category. Significant p values 

We also found a significant correlation of high ERG1 over expression with Caucasian over African American ethnicity p 0.0086 Table 8 . To further explore the correlation with PSA recurrence Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed based on three patient groups 1 CaP patients with tumor versus benign ERG1 expression ratio of less than 2 fold 2 CaP patients with tumor versus benign ERG1 expression ratio of 2 100 fold and 3 CaP patients with tumor versus benign ERG1 expression ratio of greater than 100 fold . The results show that patients with higher ERG1 over expression in their prostate tumor tissue had significantly longer PSA recurrence free survival log rank test P 0.0006 . The 36 months PSA recurrence free survival for patients with less than 2 fold ERG1 expression ratio n 24 was 54.4 while for patients with greater than 100 fold ERG1 expression ratio n 47 it was 87.7 . From a univariate COX proportional hazard ratio regression analysis for PSA recurrence free time using ERG1 tumor benign cells expression ratio race diagnostic PSA Gleason sum pathologic T stage margin status and seminal vesicle invasion status we found that five of these variables ERG1 tumor benign cells expression ratio Gleason sum pathologic T stage margin status seminal vesicle invasion had a significant p value Table 9 .

In Table 9 crude hazard ratios with 95 confidence interval are shown for ERG1 fold change tumor versus benign and six clinical parameter categories in a univariate COX proportional hazard ratio analysis. Significant p values are in bold face. The multivariate COX proportional hazard ratio regression analysis of the significant variables from the univariate analysis shows that ERG1 overexpression greater than 100 fold vs. less than 2 fold p 0.0239 RR 0.274 overall p value 0.0369 and Gleason sum Gleason 8 10 vs. Gleason 2 6 p 0.0478 RR 4.078 overall p value 0.0148 are independent predictors of PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy Table 10 . These results demonstrate that the status of ERG1 expression ratios tumor vs. benign in radical prostatectomy specimens carries a predictive value for patient prognosis.

ERG1 expression in prostate tumor tissue showed highly significant association with longer PSA recurrence free survival p 0.0042 well and moderately differentiated grade p 0.0020 lower pathologic T stage p 0.0136 and negative surgical margin status p 0.0209 suggesting that ERG1 over expression in tumor cells is generally higher in less aggressive CaP than in more aggressive CaP Table 8 .

The ERG1 over expression in tumor cells identified by GeneChip analysis and verified by real time QRT PCR assays was further validated by in situ hybridization. Based on the real time QRT PCR data 6 patients with high ERG1 over expression in their tumor cells and as a control one patient with no ERG1 over expression were selected for in situ hybridization and quantitative image analysis in a blinded fashion. As expected in each case the in situ expression data confirmed the over expression of ERG1 in the tumor epithelial cells .

ERG1 cDNA was subcloned into tetracycline regulated mammalian expression vectors pTet off EC1214A . The constructs generated include pTet off ERG1 sense pTet off ERG1 antisense pTet off FlagERG1 sense and pTet off FlagERG1 antisense . Originally ERG1 construct in a riboprobe vector pGEM was obtained from Dr. Dennis K. Watson Medical University of South Carolina. The constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing and agarose gel analysis.

Antibodies against ERG were generated using peptide antigens derived from the full length ERG1 coding sequence. The epitope for the antigen were carefully selected such that the antibody recognizes specifically ERG1 2 3 and not other members of the ETS family . The following peptides having the highest hydrophilicity 1.26 and 0.55 and antigenicity in the desired region were used to generate antibodies 

Cysteine was added to each peptide for conjugation. Peptide M is amidated at the C terminal residue because it is an internal pepetide.

The synthesis of the peptide epitopes and the immunization of rabbits were carried out in collaboration with Bio Synthesis Inc. Two rabbits were immunized for each of the two epitopes. Bleeds obtained post immunization were collected and tested. Subsequently bleeds from one of the rabbits from each epitope were affinity purified using SulfoLink kit Pierce and were verified by immunoblot analysis.

To characterize the affinity purified antibody we transiently transfected HEK 293 Human embryonic kidney cell line ATCC Manassas Va. with ERG1 constructs pTet off ERG1 sense and pTet off FlagERG1 sense using Lipofectamine reagent Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. as per manufacturers instructions. HEK 293 that were not transfected with the plasmid served as a transfection control. The cells were harvested 48 hours post transfection and processed for immunoblot analysis. Expression of ERG1 following transfection was determined by immunoblotting using the affinity purified polyclonal antisera generated against the unique M and C ERG epitopes described above. Endogenous ERG1 expression was not detected in non transfected HEK 293 cells. However the ERG antibodies detected ERG1 expression in HEK 293 cells transfected with the various ERG1 constructs. Tetracycline 2 ug ml abolished ERG1 expression in both tetracycline regulated constructs pTet off ERG1 sense and pTet off FlagERG1 sense . The M2 Flag antibody specifically recognized only the Flag tagged ERG1 protein.

The strikingly high frequency of ERG over expression in CaP cells led to a comparison of ERG expression with two other genes AMACR and DD3 that are also over expressed in CaP cells. We have evaluated quantitative gene expression features of AMACR and DD3 along with the ERG gene in laser microdissected matched tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells from 55 CaP patients.

Although other primers and probes can be used by way of example we designed the following TaqMan primers and probe recognizing the DD3 gene 

AMACR and DD3 showed upregulation in tumor cells of 78.2 and 87.3 of CaP patients respectively . ERG over expression in tumor cells was detected in 78.2 of the same group of CaP patients . Comparative expression analysis revealed that when the AMACR and ERG expression data are combined 96.4 of the CaP patients showed upregulation of either of the two genes in tumor cells . Similarly the combination of the ERG and DD3 expression data improved the cancer detection power of either of the genes to 96.4 . When combining the expression data from all the three genes 98.2 of the CaP patients showed upregulation of at least one of the three genes in tumor cells . Thus screening for ERG gene expression alone or in combination with other genes that are over expressed in CaP such as AMACR and DD3 provides a new powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for CaP.

One of the most consistently under expressed genes in CaP cells was LTF Table 1 . Validation by QRT PCR TaqMan in LCM derived tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells confirmed a consistent tumor associated LTF under expression in 100 of CaP cells tested . As a quality control the expression of AMACR a recently identified CaP tissue marker and of GSTP1 a gene showing commonly reduced or absent expression in CaP Nelson et al. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 952 135 44 2001 was also determined respectively . Robust under expression similar to LTF was observed for GSTP1 while the increased expression of AMACR was noted in 95 of the tumor cells tested confirming the high quality of the tumor and benign LCM specimens and the reliability of the QRT PCR. In a further study LTF expression was analyzed by QRT PCR in in microdissected tumor and benign prostate epithelial cells of 103 CaP patients. The results were consistent with the initial results showing tumor associated under expression in 76 of patients 78 of 103 .

LTF under expression was also validated at the protein level with anti LTF goat polyclonal antibody Santa Cruz Calif. sc 14434 using Western blot analysis on protein lysates and immunohistochemistry techniques. Hematotoxylin eosin H E and LTF staining was performed on tissue samples from 30 CaP patients by immunocytochemical analysis. In 30 of 30 100 cases benign epithelial cells adjacent to tumor cells were highly positive for LTF whereas on average less than 10 of prostate tumor cells revealed LTF positive cytoplasmic staining.
