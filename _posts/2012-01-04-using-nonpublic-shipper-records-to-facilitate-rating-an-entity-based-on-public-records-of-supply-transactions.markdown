Buyers who are interested in working with suppliers particularly overseas suppliers may have many suppliers from which they can choose. For instance in the apparel industry there are an estimated 40 000 apparel factories in China alone with some 80 000 worldwide. In order to select a supplier a buyer traditionally has had to rely on direct experience with the supplier or work through a middleman that facilitates contracting with suppliers. However working with a middle man may incur commissions for their services and working directly with the supplier may present the buyer with a large degree of uncertainty such as relating to the quality and reliability of the supplier who the supplier typically works with what type of products the supplier typically supplies materials used customers served and the like. Some information about suppliers can be obtained from other sources such as trade fairs online directories referrals and the like. These disparate sources of information are however difficult to sort through and at present there is a distinct lack of reliable and objective information that buyers can use to assess suppliers around the world. As a result buyers must proceed largely on their own and at considerable risk and expense.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

Methods and systems are provided herein for facilitating engagement of suppliers thus a supplier rating facility may make it easier for companies of all sizes to do business across borders by helping companies identify which suppliers they can trust. The suppler rating facility approach is to leverage a wide variety of quality data sources to rate suppliers around the globe. Behind each rating may be a detailed scorecard that evaluates suppliers along key dimensions. By comparing supplier scorecards subscribers may determine which suppliers are right for them. In one preferred embodiment the rating system is used to rate apparel suppliers but it should be understood that suppliers in other industries may be rated by the same or similar methods and systems such as suppliers of consumer electronics computer equipment toys and games consumer products textiles home goods food accessories computer games automotive parts electronic parts and equipment and a wide range of other goods and services such as BPO software development call centers and the like.

Presently buyers can access a plurality of supplier directories for information about suppliers. However those directories may only contain information provided by the suppliers themselves and on occasion third party information on limited subjects such as relating to creditworthiness. That information may not be particularly useful in helping customers to distinguish between good and bad suppliers. In certain preferred embodiments the supplier rating facility disclosed herein may facilitate the generation of a plurality of reports that supplement or substitute for supplier provided information the reports generated by methods and systems disclosed herein and based on a wide range of data sources. In embodiments each supplier may receive a rating between 1 and 100. Behind this rating may be a detailed scorecard each component of which being generated by an algorithm that operates on one or more relevant data sources and that evaluates suppliers along dimensions that are important to customers.

A supplier rating facility as contemplated herein may provide buyers with concrete information about which suppliers are good and which suppliers are bad which are trustworthy and which are not which are experienced in a particular area and the like. The ratings may feature a range of information about suppliers including analysis generated by algorithms operating on relevant data sources and in certain optional embodiments ratings from previous customers. Analysis may include among other things using publicly available but currently fragmented information. In various embodiments the supplier rating facility may rate suppliers along several dimensions including without limitation amount of international experience degree of specialization and standards compliance.

In certain optional embodiments ratings from previous customers may enable suppliers to gather and showcase feedback from their previous customers. Buyers may pay a subscription fee for access to ratings detail. Existing business to business sites may be able to embed the supplier rating facility in their directories and benefit from new revenue streams. Although apparel is being used as an embodiment of the invention it should be understood that the invention may be applied to any industry such as furniture electronics textiles chemicals toys food and the like. In addition services in addition to a ratings service may be facilitated through the invention such as for billing transactional settlement insurance social networking for buyers and the like. In embodiments the invention may be applied to a broad spectrum of industries where buyers and sellers are located across diverse environments and supplier product information and ratings are fragmented.

The supplier rating facility may provide a ratings platform where buyers suppliers may compare and contrast potential suppliers buyers. The ratings platform may generate and maintain ratings of suppliers buyers countries geographic regions marketplaces commodities and the like. The ratings may be presented in various forms including a listing of supplier ratings as shown in . The supplier rating list in includes a keyword around which the list is based. Although one keyword is shown in a keyword phrase group of keywords logical combination of keywords and the like may be used as a basis for the list . In an interactive embodiment of the list of selecting the keyword e.g. knitting may allow a user to make changes to the keyword to present a revised list . Also in an interactive embodiment of the list of a menu may be provided to facilitate access to other aspect of the platform and to one or more webpages associated with the platform. The list may include any number of suppliers that satisfy the keyword criteria in the example of the list includes 10 suppliers. The number of suppliers presented may be limited to fewer than the total number that match the keyword criteria. Aspect of the list such as a limit on the number of supplies in the list may be controlled by preferences e.g. user platform supplier and the like .

The list may include entries for each supplier that satisfies the keyword criteria. An entry may include an overall rating also known as the Panjiva Rating the supplier name selected bibliographic data and the like. Preferences as indicated above may impact what information is presented in an entry and the embodiment of is only an example of one set of information to be presented. Each supplier may be given an overall rating that may be based on a 100 point scale so that an overall rating may be between one and one hundred as shown in .

An alternate view of supplier rating is exemplified in which depicts a supplier scorecard which may be a detailed view of a supplier aspects related to the overall rating . The scorecard enhance the overall rating by providing details about the overall rating . A comparative rating may show the supplier overall rating in light of an average of other suppliers and may include an indication of a confidence in the overall rating . This scorecard may assess the supplier s relative strength along a variety of dimensions. Leveraging a wide variety of data sources the supplier rating facility may rate suppliers along key dimensions also known as Panjiva Analysis ratings in a plurality of categories such as business basics international track record certifications and the like. The rating platform may also allow buyers to rate suppliers along several dimensions. The scorecard may include the buyer ratings . In embodiments the ratings platform may become a place where buyers go to hold suppliers accountable. In embodiments reports such as the scorecard may be made available to users in online and print forms.

In embodiments a backend infrastructure may automatically generate customized documents by programmatically generating a representation of the document in a typesetting language such as Tex LaTeX and the like which may then be processed and turned into a PDF document.

The Business Basics section of the Supplier Scorecard may help a buyer assess whether a company is legitimate and worthy of consideration as a potential partner. Included in Business Basics may be information on whether a company has registered with authorities as well as an assessment of a trading environment in the supplier s country combining macro contextual information with data that is specific to an individual supplier and the like. A facility for determining a track record in a particular jurisdiction may use government and third party data and may assess the amount of experience a supplier has serving that jurisdiction and the loyalty that a supplier s customers have demonstrated and the like. The Standards Compliance section of the Supplier Scorecard may document whether a supplier has been certified as meeting international standards for quality management respect for the environment social responsibility product safety and the like.

The ratings scorecard may include a plurality of analysis dimensions such as county context business legitimacy public recognition amount of experience caliber of customers customer loyalty specialization quality management social responsibility environmental responsibility and the like. Buyer feedback dimensions may include product quality customer service timeliness of delivery language skills sample making ability respect for intellectual property and the like. Supplier information may include contact information areas of expertise caliber of customers ratings and the like. A confidence in buyer feedback may be established by determining that the feedback is being provided by a supplier who is or recently was receiving shipments from the supplier. This can be done by ensuring that transaction records validate that at least some supplier shipments were supplied to the buyer providing the feedback. In embodiments information utilized in the formation of the ratings scorecard may be from shipment history such as frequency quantity and the like shipment capacity estimation which may be based on shipment data as opposed to information provided by the supplier.

Contact information may include making all contact information available to subscribers so that they may directly contact suppliers. Areas of expertise may tell a buyer which products a supplier has shipped which materials it has used which techniques it has employed and whether it has produced men s apparel women s apparel or both. Caliber of customers may tell a buyer which types of customers a supplier has served such as premium mass discount and or niche customers. In embodiments buyers may rate suppliers with whom they have done business. After a buyer rates a supplier the supplier rating facility may verify that that the two have actually done business together such as by identifying a corresponding customs records that shows an actual import transaction in which the buyer imported goods from the supplier from a bill of lading from a bank issued receipt and the like. Thus methods and systems disclosed herein include methods and systems for deterring fraudulent ratings by verifying the existence of the transaction purportedly rated by the buyer. This may prevent false ratings that are either too positive such as by an affiliate or cohort of the supplier or too negative such as by a competing supplier posing as a buyer . After verification the buyer s rating may become part of the supplier s scorecard. As part of the verification process the buyer s identity may be revealed to the supplier. However in embodiments the buyer s identity may be obscured so that it does not appear on the supplier rating facility s website and is not shared with anyone else. In embodiments only buyers who have provided feedback on their suppliers may view buyer feedback. In embodiments a computer facility for recording transactions associated with one or more buyers with one or more sellers may include a user interface that may facilitate determination of entity score based on transactional data. The transactional data may be related to the shipping details of the goods and services associated with different entities. In an example entities such as buyers may order goods and services from the sellers resulting in transactions. An aggregation facility may collect combine or aggregate transactions associated with different entities. Subsequently an association facility may facilitate association of transactions with different entities. The transactions may be analyzed by the analysis facility to generate an entity score corresponding to each entity.

In embodiments rating a supplier buyer or other entity may result in a score that is at least partially based on predefined criteria such as a user provided criteria. Alternatively the system and methods herein may facilitate rating of a supplier buyer or other entity based one or more algorithms. The rating algorithms may be manually selected or may be selected automatically based on a set of algorithm selection rules. In an example a supplier may be known in the industry as highly credible. One or more rating algorithms may be applied to transaction data and may use predefined criteria for the algorithms to mathematically determine the credibility of the supplier. This determined credibility rating may be provided to the buyer through a user interface of the platform.

In embodiments the entity score may be based in part on transactional data related to the shipments by the entity such as delivery data amount shipped location of shipment and the like. In an example a supplier providing goods and services within the stipulated delivery date may garner higher ratings compared to the suppliers who failed to deliver on time.

In embodiments the entity score may be based on one more factors including country context business legitimacy information public recognition amount of experience caliber of customers of the supplier customer loyalty for the supplier degree of specialization of the supplier and feedback from previous customers or some other factors. Further each factor or group of factors may include a list of parameters. A user interface may be configured to allow a user to select some or all the parameters from this group to generate an entity rating. In an example the group country content may include variables such as GNI per capita currency volatility cost to export political stability and the like. The user interface may allow a user to select GNI per capita and cost to export to generate a country context value that would be applied to calculate an entity rating. Furthermore determination of the entity score may depend partially or completely on some or all the parameters selected from some or all the groups as described herein and elsewhere. In an example a buyer who may be interested in knowing the quality of a product or service provided by a supplier may select feedback from previous customer groups on which to base an entity score for the supplier. This group may further include parameters such as timely delivery of goods quality of goods number of transactions and the like. Rather than choosing just the group rating to determine an entity rating the buyer may choose some or all the parameters from this group to determine the entity score associated with the supplier. In another example the score associated with the supplier may be determined based on two or more groups comprising multiple parameters such as the group pertaining to the degree of specialization of the supplier and the group pertaining to feedback from previous customers. The buyer may select the group degree of specialization and one or more parameters from the group. Similarly the buyer may select one or more parameters from the feedback from the previous customers group. The entity score may be determined based on parameters selected in each of the groups.

A user interface such as the user interface of may be used to present the various ratings scores and rating factors to be applied to the entity rating score.

In embodiments a supplier rating facility or buyer rating facility may take ratings along each of key dimensions weight the ratings to account for the fact that some dimensions are more important than others calculate an overall rating and the like. In embodiments ratings may provide a measure of caliber such as the caliber of a buyer or the caliber of a supplier.

The supplier rating facility may rate suppliers across a plurality of different dimensions some of which may derive from actual transactional data such as customs data with others based on sources such as Dun Bradstreet the World Bank auditing firms for various certifications government sources and the like. In embodiments more weight may be given to recent data data for larger transactions data for higher quality buyers or other types of data with respect to which there is an indicator that the data may have higher relevance than other types of data. The supplier rating facility may also provide a more intuitive understanding to ratings by considering caliber of customers customer loyalty specialization and the like. Caliber of customers may involve manually grouping buyers into distinct bands or tiers such as premium mass market discount niche and the like and then computing a sum based on the newness of each buyer supplier relationship and the tier of each buyer.

In embodiments rating for a supplier may be based on the aggregated transactional customs data a user defined criteria customs data related to transactions by the supplier with a third party or on some other parameters. In an example a supplier may be rated based on the number of transactions done with a particular buyer. In another example a user may define adherence to delivery data as a criteria for rating the supplier. In addition the rating of the supplier may be based at least in part on loyalty as indicated by an analysis of customs transactions. Furthermore the determination of rating for the supplier may based on an amount of supplier experience as indicated by customs transactions related to the number of shipments duration of supplier experience as indicated by shipments size of transactions as indicated by past shipments extent of international experience as indicated by past shipments extent of country relevant experience as indicated by past shipments and the like.

In embodiments a rating for a buyer may be based on aggregated transactional customs data customs data related to transactions of the buyer with a third party or some other parameter. In an example ratings for the buyer may be based on the feedback about the buyer provided by one or more suppliers. In addition ratings for the buyer may also be based on two or more factors selected from a group including the country context of a party the business legitimacy of a party whether a party is registered with government authorities an assessment of a trading environment in a country macroeconomic information public recognition of a party industry awards industry certifications amount of experience number of shipments duration of experience size of transactions extent of domestic experience extent of international experience caliber of customers customer loyalty degree of specialization specialization in product categories specialization in manufacturing techniques specialization in materials specialization in gender feedback from customers feedback from buyers feedback on product quality feedback on customer service feedback on timeliness of delivery feedback on language skills feedback on sample making ability respect for intellectual property quality management social responsibility environmental responsibility standards of compliance certifications and certifications with respect to specific vendor standards and the like.

In embodiments the rating of the buyer may be based on loyalty as indicated by an analysis of customs transactions. In an example a buyer may be rated based on the number of transactions with a particular supplier in a specific time frame. In addition the buyer may be rated based on an amount of experience as indicated by customs transactions related to the number of shipments duration of experience as indicated by shipments size of transactions as indicated by past shipments extent of international experience as indicated by past shipments extent of country relevant experience as indicated by past shipments and the like.

In embodiments a rating may be made of customer loyalty for a supplier. A customer loyalty rating method may include analyzing the set of buyers who have done business with each supplier over the course of several years and identifying loyalty periods intervals in which a buyer consistently sources from a given supplier and switches where a buyer ceases obtaining a given set of products from one supplier and begins sourcing from another supplier. Suppliers for whom there have been many switches may be given lower ratings while suppliers with long loyalty periods and few switches may be given higher ratings.

In embodiments a rating may relate to the degree of specialization of a supplier. A specialization rating method may decompose supplier shipments into dimensions such as product category technique material gender and the like. These dimensions may be independent of the rating dimensions or may be used as a factor in rating.

In embodiments methods and systems may include methods for generating raw scores. Generation of raw scores may use a variety of techniques to transform raw customs data and other third party data into meaningful ratings. Consideration may be given to customer loyalty caliber of customers amount of experience specialization country context business legitimacy environmental responsibility social responsibility quality management public recognition and the like. Customer loyalty rating may include identifying shipping patterns buyer patterns loyalty periods and the like. Caliber of customer ratings may include assigning a buyer tier length of time in that tier age of buyer and the like. Experience ratings may include evaluating number of shipments duration of experience size of transactions handled and the like. Specialization ratings may include or reference a measure of the extent to which a supplier focuses on a narrow range of products materials and or techniques. A supplier having government registration records a Dun Bradstreet DUNS number or other evidence of business legitimacy may provide business legitimacy ratings. Environmental social product safety and quality management ratings may be derived from a supplier having appropriate certifications and the like. Public recognition ratings may include reference to government and industry awards and the like. In embodiments high risk suppliers and high risk buyers may be identified such as in association with individuals and organizations that work with high risk suppliers and high risk buyers. Country context ratings may be related to the country in which a supplier is located as well as data supplied by the World Bank International Monetary Fund and other sources about that country. Other sources may include GNI per capita currency volatility cost to export political stability credit rank export cost gci efficiency enhancers and the like. A country context computation may include calculating a weighted sum of log gni per capita credit rank log export cost and gci efficiency enhancers that may be then thresholded into final score buckets. The weights and thresholds used in the country context computation may have been determined using machine learning techniques e.g. decision trees and principal component analysis to determine the relevant features to weight appropriate weights and effective thresholds.

Generating ratings from raw scores may include a weighting standardization or normalization factor applied to raw data to produce a standard score that may be centered on zero and then normalized to a rating between 0 and 100. These values may then be applied to a scorecard that presents the normalized data for a supplier. In embodiments the ratings may be scaled linearly to provide a mean of approximately 50 as in a Gaussian distribution.

In addition ratings may be customized to individual buyer preferences such as by having buyer s rate suppliers with whom they have done business. Ratings may then be tuned to best match this empirical view of a buyer s preferences. Such an approach may use a machine learning technique such as a support vector machine. Over time trends in ratings may then be captured and displayed to the buyer. Such trends may enable a graph theory analysis e.g. minimum cut maximum flow cliques and the like on buyer supplier networks to determine the relationships between groups of buyers and suppliers which may lead to additional value added services such as improving production allocation for buyers.

Referring to integration of transactional data with data from non transactional data sources is shown. A computer facility may receive transaction records associated with a plurality of buyers such as A and B and or a plurality of sellers such as A and B. Furthermore the computer facility may include an aggregation facility an association facility a storage facility an integration facility an analysis facility and the like. The aggregation facility may collect and combine the transaction records associated with buyers and suppliers for processing at the association facility . The association facility may enable association of transactions with different entities such as buyer A and supplier B. The association facility may be coupled to any of the other facilities within the computer facility such as the integration facility which may receive non transaction data from non transaction sources . The analysis facility may facilitate evaluation of suppliers and buyers based on the data integrated from other sources and the data received from the association facility .

In embodiments public records may include customs records apart from other records. The customs record may include information associated with an entity as captured by a customs organization. The information may be useful in identifying the different transactions associated with the entity s billing based on the entity s custom identification number.

Data sources may leverage data from several hundred data sources such as International Oeko Tex Association Social Accountability International Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production WRAP Fifty five ISO 9001 auditing firms Forty six ISO 14001 auditing firms Forty seven OHSAS 18001 auditing firms Two GB T 18885 auditing firms United States Department of Homeland Security Ministry of Commerce of the People s Republic of China General Administration of Customs of the People s Republic of China and the like. In embodiments custom data may be from countries all over the world covering exports and imports where an import record may be matched up with an export record.

Tools used in the analysis of supplier and buyer data may include a merger tool a suggestive merger tool a buyer caliber tool a buyer marketing tool a name chooser tool a country manager an API a product keyword manager tool a statistics tool a report generation tool a supplier marketing tool a name updater and the like. Any of these tools may be embodied in the facilities of computer facility .

In embodiments aggregated customs data may be processed to identify transactions associated with different types of entities such as buyers and or suppliers. In addition based on the transactions associated with different entities an entity type may be determined from one or more entity types present in the transactions. In an example an entity may supply woolen clothes and the transactions associated with the shipments of the woolen clothes may be recorded as being provided by ABC co . In another transaction the same entity may be recorded as ABC Company . This variation may be due to a difference in recording of transactions of customs data due to variations in filling data in the customs form rather than the entities being different entities. A data merging facility may allow automatic merging of transaction records described above under a single entity based on the inference made on grounds of similarity of data. In this example the variations ABC co and ABC Company may form a valid case of merging of data based on the minor variation in entity name. Alternatively to automatic merging or in addition to it suggestions for merging similar data based on similarity in data elements may be provided to a user. In the above example records relating to transactions ABC co and ABC Company may be presented to the user with a suggestion to merge them under a single entity based on similarity of data elements. The similarity of data element in the records may be determined by the data merging facility. Based on the user s response automatic merging of the two entity names may be learned by the platform.

A variety of tools techniques for identifying companies that may be similar in some respect may be provided. A user interface may provide similarity features so that a user may identify companies that are similar. Such a user interface may facilitate identifying companies that are similar to a company e.g. a buyer or seller being presented to the user. The user may have selected a set of criteria for identifying a particular company and may be presented with a utility that enables the user to select these or other parameters associated with the particular company for finding similar companies. Identifying similar companies may be based on weighted similarity criteria which may be selected by a user in the user interface extracted from a user profile automatically selected by a similarity engine recommended to the user and the like. Weighted similarity criteria may include a product mix a minimum quantity location of a supplier or any other factor. For example a user might select similarity criteria including i supplying Leather 2 sourcing from China and 3 a minimum order of 10 square yards with the minimum order criteria weighted at 1.5 the other two criteria.

To facilitate accessing information e.g. profiles ratings etc of similar companies a similarity engine may generate suggestions of similar companies based on search criteria. A user may enter the search criteria through a programming interface e.g. an API and the like. The similar company suggestions may include a ranking that is based on the level of similarity between the search criteria and the searched results. For example a user may search for suppliers that supply a specific product and operate in a specific location. The similarity engine may generate one or more suggestions for companies that are similar and may rank the suggestions based on similarity to a search criteria. Similarity suggestions may be based on user behaviors and interactions with the system. The criteria used for making the suggestions may be weighted based on the user history of searches rating reviews and the like.

The similarity engine may alternatively be used to identify potential alternatives for a given company and those alternatives e.g. competitors may be offered an opportunity to provide a message such as an advertisement to the user while the user is viewing the similar company. For example a user searching for supplier of leather goods in China might be sent offers related to a supplier of leather goods in India. The similarity engine may be useful to help vendors who offer products or services that may compliment other products or services to gain visibility with users seeking information about products to which they offer similar services. In an example a user might be sent offers related to leather dye or leather dying services provider when the user searched for suppliers of leather products . Alternatively the similarity engine may notify a similar company of searches that were performed for which that company was suggested as a similar company. This information may be useful to a company to adjust the information by which it may be identified by the similarity engine.

An entity may be associated with one or more names for performing transactions that may be captured in customs records. As described above the difference may be due to a variation in recording of the customs data. The systems and methods described herein may facilitate merging of any number of transactions that should be associated with a particular entity even though the records show a plurality of similar but varied entity names.

In addition to facilitating processing aggregated customs data so as to associate a set of transactions with an entity a plurality of transactions that are properly associated with a plurality of entities may be merged under an entity type for purposes of evaluating the transactions and entities associated therewith. The merged records may be useful in evaluating a market segment consortium of companies industry segment regional results class of entities and the like. In an example transactions associated with several entities may be merged based on the basis of the transactions being associated with a single buyer. Even though the transactions call out different suppliers in different industries the single buyer is a basis for processing the transactions as if they were merged.

An entity type may be defined based on any aspect of an entity that may be used to process customs transaction records. The methods and systems of filtering classification and clustering of transactions as described herein may be applied to identify transactions that are mergeable under an entity type. In an example a buyer may initiate purchase transactions with four suppliers of components to produce an item. The transactions between any of the four suppliers and the common buyer can be merged or tagged as mergeable as having a common entity type such as supplier to common buyer . Other suppliers who ship items to the common buyer may have their transactions with the common buyer merged under the same entity type.

In many cases multiple data records exist for a single supplier but the relationship of those records to that single supplier is ambiguous. In an example the name of the supplier might appear in one field in one record but in a completely different field in another record. This is often the case in customs data where forms are filled out with information in various fields notwithstanding the purported standardization of the forms. In embodiments a merger tool may be used to merge data records of two apparent suppliers that should really be one supplier. The merger tool may evaluate an address and if the same in two records select a parent record and identify child records upon which records are merged into a single record. In embodiments a merger tool may merge records that are on the same page or more generally merge records across a database. In embodiments a merger tool may use a pattern matching technique to identify potential candidates for merging of records

In embodiments a search link may be provided for each buyer such as one that retrieves search results from a search engine directory rating system or other source of information about the buyer. In embodiments an interface such as an overall buyer manager may assist suppliers in searching for different buyers.

In embodiments a buyer marketing tool may break down data for a particular supplier such as addresses from customs data raw customs records records that show customer loyalty periods and switches to other suppliers specific breakdowns of what the supplier has shipped e.g. in terms of product category material technique gender of the shipped garments and the like breakdowns of the size of the shipments the supplier has made breakdowns of the number of shipments that the supplier has made each month over some time period as to determine the estimated capacity of a supplier and the estimated minimum shipment that a supplier is willing to produce. In an example a tool may show a breakdown of suppliers e.g. showing a number of suppliers such as 35 suppliers in ratings for each where it is possible to see a history of which suppliers buyers have used. This may allow marketers to evaluate their performance relative to other suppliers with whom they compete.

A country manager tool may be used to add data on countries such as for the country context dimension of an overall rating or analysis .

In embodiments an application programming interface may be provided for the platform described herein whereby other computer programs may access the reports generated by the platform such as accessing overall ratings specific components of ratings results of particular algorithms or data sources used in the platform. Thus other parties that engage in global trade such as clients of the facilitator and partners may obtain access to the platform allowing the ratings managed by the platform to become a standard measure by which suppliers are rated.

A product keyword manager tool may provide an ontology or hierarchy for a search interface such as using graphs charts and the like. The manager may allow a facilitator to add or delete sub categories to a category. Keywords associated with each of the categories may be useful for 1 getting the data allowing a user to scan through raw text of customs data looking for these keywords which is one way for the facilitator to know that a supplier has shipped something within a category In an example a search for infant clothing might search for all sub categories using words such as baby infant kiddy kid layette maternity newborn toddler and the like and 2 using keywords for text entry into the search field such as synonyms to get better search results . In an example in a hierarchy of materials there are sub materials of materials and each has keywords associated with it. In embodiments a facilitator may engage in a process manual or automatic to generate key words such as using glossaries that list all of the products and materials with specific definitions. In embodiments algorithms may be used to determine the market vertical e.g. apparel supplier or electronics supplier etc. of a supplier based on the aggregate contents of all of its shipments. In embodiments customs records may be utilized to identify what industry or vertical the material is in.

A statistics tool may assist in providing distributions of data. Thus a facilitator may support statistical distributions for all dimensions of data analyzed by the methods and systems of the platform.

A bucket boundary check tool may assist in testing that suppliers that fall within specific rating buckets or bins e.g. Excellent Unproven etc. by showing suppliers that are at the high and low boundary of each bucket.

A report generation tool may automatically build PDF reports or reports in other output formats such as PowerPoint Excel Word and the like. The report generation tool can be used as an administrative tool or as a tool to allow users or clients to build custom reports such as ones that incorporate some or all of the data generated by the platform. In an example a user may specify which supplier or suppliers the report should include. A report could be made vertical specific covering a number of suppliers in a vertical such as a theme or characteristic grouping or it could relate to standout suppliers such as ones with high customer loyalty ratings top amounts of experience or the like . In embodiments a user may turn on or off various sections. In embodiments the end product of a report may be a link that allows the user to download the report in PDF format or some other format or which sends the report via email in PDF format or some other format .

In embodiments a buyer marketing tool may provide information about what product materials product techniques and the like particular buyers require from their suppliers. Such a tool may also provide information relating to how many shipments particular buyers imported over time as well as the breakdown of shipment sizes.

A marketing tool may be used by an operator of the platform to at least identify opportunities of marketing the products and services associated with the platform to suppliers buyers and others. The marketing tool can also be accessed by suppliers as shown in and by buyers as depicted in . However when used by the operator or owner of the platform or of an implementation of a portion of the platform the marketing tool has significant capabilities. The marketing tool may work collaboratively with other elements of the platform such as elements that perform aggregation association merging storage collection analysis user interface and the like. A marketing tool may be used to identify instances of potential scenarios e.g. suppliers in financial distress to offer entities that may be potentially impacted by the scenario instance e.g. the supplier s shippers buyers suppliers of raw goods and the like with services and products available through the methods and systems described herein.

The marketing tool may also work cooperatively with a user interface to facilitate an operator entering parameters of marketing opportunity scenarios that the marketing tool can evaluate. The entered scenario parameters and attributes may be applied to an analysis of customs transaction data and marketing opportunities may be presented to the operator through the user interface.

As shown in a marketing tool may be provided for a supplier . The marketing tool may be provided in a computer facility . As explained in the description for and the computer facility may include a collection facility a storage facility an aggregation facility and an association facility . The collection facility may collect a plurality of public records of transactions among a plurality of buyers and a plurality of suppliers . In an example the collection facility may collect the public records of transactions between buyer and supplier . The storage facility may store the plurality of public records of transactions among a plurality of buyers and a plurality of suppliers . The aggregation facility may aggregate the transactions. The association facility may associate the transactions with various entities that may include but may not be limited to companies buyers sellers suppliers distributors factories subsidiaries of a supplier and the like. An analysis facility may analyze the aggregated transactions. The marketing tool may suggest a marketing strategy for the supplier based on analysis of transactional data from public records. In an example the marketing tool may suggest to the supplier that it would be lucrative to sell 100 tons of silk fabric every week to the buyer located in the United States of America. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the marketing tool may suggest marketing strategies to a plurality of suppliers simultaneously.

As shown in a marketing tool for the buyer may be provided. The marketing tool may be provided in a computer facility . The marketing tool may suggest a marketing strategy for the buyer based on analysis of transactional data from public records. In an example the marketing tool may suggest to the buyer that it would be lucrative to buy 50 tons of silk fabric on a monthly basis from the supplier located in China. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that the marketing tool may suggest marketing strategies to a plurality of buyers simultaneously.

Processing customs transactions and other records may involve a multi step method. Data from customs organizations such as US Customs may be provided on a removable computer memory such as a CD DVD flash memory memory stick USB memory card and any other type of removable or portable memory device. Alternatively the customs data may be acquired via a network such as the Internet a dialup connection a virtual private network a dedicated network and the like. The data may also be converted from a proprietary format for further processing by the platform. Each customs organization and within any customs organization for a particular country may have a different format or storage device for records. Conversion may be performed on the data so that the end result is independent of the physical format of delivery and the logical formatting of the information. In this way data in a substantially unified format may be processed by the methods and systems of supplier rating and the like that are herein disclosed. In an example US customs data may be provided on a CD and may be in a COBOL format. The data on the CD may be retrieved and automatically loaded to a server. The server or another computing device may convert the data from the COBOL format to an XML format. The XML formatted data may be loaded to a database such as a Postgres database for further processing. In this example XML format represents a unified format for the customs data.

Processing the converted transaction data may include multiple steps of data analysis in which a confidence level may be applied. Confidence levels may be grouped into confidences bands that may help target each transaction toward one of merging high confidence band suggest human aided merging medium confidence band and do not merge low or lacking confidence band . Analysis of the transaction data may reveal important information about the entities involved in the transactions. In an example a single entity may appear as a buyer in one transaction a shipper in another and a supplier in a third. Ensuring that each transaction is properly associated with the entity as its intended function buyer shipper and supplier may be accomplished through various analysis and assessment techniques including similarity assessment filtering classification clustering and the like.

Processing of customs data may also include text mining. Text mining may include searching for key words terms or phrases that are known predetermined or specified for the mining operation. An ontology of terms such as gender dyeing may be applied in text mining. In addition synonyms of keywords may be mined. Text mining also facilitates populating reports with various data such as time series data of shipments per month and weight of shipments per month.

Data may be further analyzed with a monitoring tool that may look for anomalies such as peaks and other statistical measures to identify potentially important events that are captured in the transactions. Analyzing data for peaks and the like may help with activating buyers suppliers shippers and other entities for use in the platform. A statistical event such as a spike in orders by a buyer that otherwise had little transaction history may trigger an indication that the buyer should be activated for use in ratings of buyers suppliers and the like. Alternatively or in addition an entity may be activated based on the transactions for the entity complying with criteria such as a shipment quantity threshold and the like.

Merging data ensures that all records of transactions associated with an entity buyer supplier or the like are properly recorded against the correct entity. However due to the large number of data sources substantial variations in how an entity may be identified in records from the data sources parent subsidiary entity relationships transaction system limitations e.g. limiting the number of characters in an entity name regional differences dialect differences use of short hand for entity information various coding schemes used by buyers suppliers and the like proper merging of data is complex and difficult. Data may be received in tabular format with column headings indicative of an expected type of data to be found on each row. IN tabular format data in each row under a column heading of Company Name is expected to include a company name. Data may also be received in record field format in which each field of each record includes a field identifier and a value. The platform analyzes the data in these and may other disparate data formats to perform the merging functions described herein.

In a fundamental example merging is taking two records for the same entity that each has entity information that varies substantially one from the other and ensuring that the records are properly recorded against the one entity rather than being assigned to two separate entities. A merger tool may provide robust accurate and efficient merging of data by resolving the variations some of which are described above so that records for a single entity are merged while ensuring that records for a different entity are kept separate from the single entity.

Within any given country industry region or language there is no universal entity identifier that could be applied to the data records to uniquely identify which entity is associated with each transaction record. Also with data records being provided by sources from many countries in many industries and across many languages the merging challenge is increased. A way to meet this challenge today is to perform processing of the text that is present in the records to determine which records should be merged under an entity. Various techniques of text association filtering character grouping thesaurus lookup machine learning natural language processing search based comparison classification known entity matching clustering and the like may be applied to identify mergeable records. The complexity and challenge present in merging may require applying each technique in an intelligent way so that highly computation intensive processes such as classification are used appropriately.

One objective of merging is to take a set of input records and match them to entities that are already known to the platform such as entities already included in an entity database or other database of the platform. When a match cannot be determined automatically with a sufficient confidence level then information may be presented to an operator or user of the platform to make a final determination of the entity associated with the record s .

The methods and techniques for identifying mergeable records may be programmed into a processing unit and run in a sequence that facilitates rapid and robust merging of records. Merging of records may be performed as a continuous process rather than a batch process so as new datasets or changes to an existing dataset are presented updates to mergeable relationships may be determined. Also because updates or new datasets may be presented at any time and without any particular coordination among them continuous processing that is not necessarily tied to any event or schedule is preferred. At least three types of processing may be performed on records for merging assessment filtering classification and clustering. Each processing type will be described now.

Because classification and clustering may be very expensive in terms of compute processing time filtering is applied to distinguish candidate records for classification from records that are unlikely to be mergeable under a single entity. Filtering provides various techniques to help identify only the records that classification may have any chance of merging. Filtering for the purposes of merging may be considered a coarse sort of the records capturing candidates for classification and passing through those records that appear to be far removed from the captured records. Filtering may be performed by a variety of filter type algorithms. In one example filtering may be performed by search engine software such as the open source lucene search engine. In another example of filtering sometimes referred to as kgram filtering several small consecutive strings of characters are captured from each of two records and compared. Kgram filtering may be based on techniques of dynamic programming. In an application of kgram filtering when a sufficient number of the character strings match between the records the records may be identified as potential candidates for further processing such as classification and clustering. One benefit to kgram filtering is that it offers the filter designer many options such as allowing overlapping character strings defining the length of each character string determining the quantity of matching strings required to mark the record s as classification candidates. In this way an entity name or entity identifying information that may include entity name logo phone number address and the like need not be an exact match but instead needs enough matching character strings to exceed a kgram filter threshold. In an example a kgram filter may compare overlapping character strings kgram filter group of 10 characters and may require that at least 10 of the character strings must match kgram filter threshold for the record to be identified as a potential candidate for classification and clustering. Because records received and processed by the platform may have information within certain fields that may be incorrectly placed there a personal name in an entity name field filtering can be used to quickly separate out records that are incorrect.

Filtering is preferentially performed against the other records in any given data set without specific consideration of existing entity profiles or known data. This results in determining potentially mergeable records within any given dataset. However information about entities is known to the platform from all previously processed datasets and this information can be beneficially applied during filtering to improve confidence levels in the filter results. Entities may be known to the platform based on characteristics such as entity name address country and the like. Filtering may employ the techniques described above to also determine potential matches between known entities and entities found in the dataset being processed. These potential matches with known entities may be graded or rated in such a way as to improve the confidence level of the relative matches found within the dataset.

Similarly information from previously processed datasets may be beneficially applied to help identify elements in the dataset being processed. Data in the dataset being processed may be compared to data known to the platform e.g. country names freight forwarding services addresses product types and the like to produce a set of ratings of how well the data in the dataset being processed matches to the known data. The outcome of this matching may be combined with the known entity matching to improve likelihood of the potential matches within the dataset being processed.

Another merge technique is called classification. Classification may be performed on any records although records that have been identified by filtering as candidates for classification may yield faster and more robust classification results. Because records with non matching entity information may be records of a single entity classification uses text language mathematical and other analysis techniques to identify a likelihood that two records are from the same entity. Classification includes a variety of techniques including canonical adaptation specific cleanups multi field comparison name address phone number etc edit distance algorithms vector generation machine learning decision tree and the like.

In canonical adaptation entity information in records is adapted to eliminate differences that should not impact classification. Differences such as abbreviations of words rd. for road ave for avenue CA for California and the like can be normalized in the records. Punctuation and other characters that may have minor impact on a classification may be removed or marked to be ignored during various classification and clustering techniques. In addition to canonical adaptation targeted cleanups may be applied to further normalize the data. Cleanups may help to resolve deficiencies in the records such as an incorrect country of origin which is a common deficiency. Cleanups may be based on information about the domain of the records to further enhance entity identification and merging. Cleanups may be based on geographic or regional knowledge market verticals industry norms and the like. In an example within a market vertical variations of textile suppliers names may be applied to quickly align the various names to a normalized or canonical entity name thereby reducing the degree of complexity that further classification techniques will have to deal with. The result may include less complex mathematical computation. Cleanups maybe targeted at specific aspects of the records such as entity names city names street names phone numbers and the like. Any number of these cleanups may be applied sequentially or in parallel to data records to improve mergability of the records.

To account for differences in data entry that may result in a very low classification score classification techniques herein are applied to individual fields entity name field address field as well as to combinations of fields entity name address field so that a record with an entity name in an address field can still be identified as mergeable with other records that have the address in the address field.

Data that has been cleaned or adapted as described above and elsewhere herein may be processed through edit distance metric algorithms such as Wagner Fischer Levenshtein Jaro Winkler and the like. The result of which may be a complex vector of numbers that represent dimensions of similarity associated with the various classification techniques applied. The vectors of similarity may be based on other classification and text analysis techniques as may be know to those skilled in the art. All such classification and analysis techniques may be applied to the records by the platform and are included herein.

Machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be applied to determine if similarity vectors of pairs of records identify records that can be merged under a common entity. Through the use of training vectors and decision tree logic record mergability may be further assessed and a measure of such mergability may be made available to clustering techniques. The result may include an identification of pair wise matches among all of the classification candidate records.

Training vectors may be derived from transaction data. A set of transactions may be identified as a training set that may be useful in establishing prediction parameters for associating shipments with attributes such as a type of entity type of supplier type of product product feature or attribute type of material and the like. A training set may also be useful for facilitating association of a shipment with an entity by enabling development of prediction parameters that may be used therefore. By identifying candidate relationships between shipments and attributes or entities training sets of transaction records may reduce the computational load required for comprehensively filtering classifying and clustering. In an example a record may be presented to a processing facility such as an analysis facility J32. The processing facility may select prediction parameters based on one or more data fields in the record. Certain fields in the transaction record may be compared to a portion of the prediction parameters to predict an entity to associate to a transaction record.

Prediction of an attribute associated with a transaction or customs record or any other data record in various datasets may be useful for rolled up aggregated or otherwise cumulative transaction data. Because transaction records may be individual shipment records aggregated transaction records rolled up or summarized transaction data and the like predicting an attribute that may be associated with rolled up transactions may allow the platform to gain significant benefit from otherwise non specific data. In an example US customs records may record each shipment from China as an individual customs transaction record but the transactions may not identify the supplier just the shipper and buyer. However China may only provide a rolled up transaction that cumulates similar shipments over a period of time such as a calendar month. The rolled up transaction data from China may have some data elements that distinguish it partially such as a product identifier source region shipper supplier and the like. The US customs transaction data for a calendar month may be used to identify prediction parameters that may be applied to the China transaction data to predict the supplier. When US customs training set data such as shipment quantity shipper and the like are applied to the China data a supplier may be predicted for the rolled up China transaction data.

An objective of clustering is to cluster as many data records that should be merged under a common entity as possible. Clustering may result in all of the variations of one entity being identified as one entity. A technique for clustering that may be applied is referred to herein as p percent clustering. In p percent clustering a pair match threshold is established and any record that matches at least the threshold percent of records in any given cluster will be added to the cluster. In this way although pair wise matching identifies all pairs of matched records clustering allows records that do not all match each other to form a cluster. In an example if a p percent threshold is 25 then any record that pair wise matches at least 25 of cluster members may be added to the cluster. In an embodiment dynamic p percent may allow dynamic adjustment of p percent based on an aspect of the cluster records and the like. In an example p percent may be set low for a small cluster and may be increased for a large cluster. P percent clustering ensures that records that have strong matches to some of the members of the cluster can be properly included in the cluster. P percent offers significant advantages over single dimension single link clustering techniques.

Filtering classification and clustering are important and facilitate merging of intra data source records e.g. new transactions for an existing company as well as external data source records e.g. US to China customs data records . These techniques are also applicable to determine potential matches of records in non transaction datasets such as financial reporting datasets government records industry records company records inventory records market analysis records and the like. Also these techniques may be useful in classifying entities into industries or markets.

These and other merge techniques can be applied to determine matches between records in a new dataset and existing data such as existing entities. Existing entities may be entities that are known to the platform from processing various data sets. Each entity known to the platform may be configured with an entity profile that may include or reference the various risk opportunity and other profiles described herein. The merging techniques described herein may result in a match likelihood score or confidence level for each record processed. If the match likelihood score is above a configurable threshold the platform may automatically convert a potential match to a known match and allocate the data record to a particular known entity. IF the match likelihood score is lower than the threshold then various manual assisted techniques such as the suggested merger tool described herein or the user interfaces for configuring parameters to guide automatic merging may be employed to facilitate converting a potential match to a known match.

Because an entity profile is generally determined by at least an entity name and an entity address and it is common for an entity to be associated with more than one address across various datasets techniques for determining which of the various addresses are to be associated with the entity as the primary address may be determined from the statistical mode of the records. Therefore if an entity name is found in various datasets to have three different addresses the address found in the greatest number of matched data records may be allocated as the primary address of the entity. However the other addresses may also be allocated to the entity as tertiary addresses for the purposes of facilitating matching new data records e.g. new datasets to the entity.

Information about known entities may be weighted based on a confidence level of the entity. Information for entities for which the platform has processed large amounts of data may be weighted more heavily in a matching process because the large amounts of data may statistically improve the confidence in the information. As a result data in a dataset being processed that potentially matches to heavily weighted data may more readily exceed an automatic match threshold.

As changes to datasets are processed previously known matches may be brought into question and may be marked for review. The automated techniques described above may not always provide a match likelihood score above the configurable threshold for changed records. In such situations manual assist techniques and match adjustment user interfaces may also be used to facilitate improvement or correction.

The platform may also incorporate business rules associated with various datasets. Business rules may impact the use of data records in a dataset. Business rules may limit for example what information may be made available to the users of the platform such as to preserve the confidentiality of entities or individuals in the dataset. In an example while non identifying information in a dataset such as an industry classification of an entity may be forwarded to users of the platform the entity name may be required to be kept confidential. In another example entity names may be used internally within the platform for matching and data analysis purposes as described herein but the entity names and any entity identifying information e.g. address phone and the like may be required to be kept confidential. Another example is that some fields of a restricted dataset may only be shown to an end user if it or perhaps some distinct other fields are corroborated via a different data source also merged to the entity. For example an entity can be presented as a certified entity along with the name and address and certain other bits of information if the entity is matched corroborated by entity name and address with the name and address of an entity from a different dataset. Although the match need not be exact it must be sufficiently close to satisfy the match corroborate business rule associated with the restricted dataset.

As each new entity is detected it is assigned an ID. This ID is beneficially applied to link particular data records in the many different data sources so that at any point in time the data that has been matched to the entity with a specific ID is known. Generally the association s between one or more IDs and a data record are stored in a database of pointers to records in the various datasets that may be organized by the ID. In this way each record that contributes to each ID is traceable. Because the data provided in the data sources is not completely static e.g. an updated version of the data source is provided updated versions of a data source must be analyzed to determine if the matches that existed before the update are still valid. Matching activities based on updates of any of the many data sources may impact an entity profile and therefore change one or more key parameters associated with an ID. This may result in some previous matches between records in an unchanged data set and the updated profiles being determined to be invalid and the invalid matches are reassigned to a different ID. Likewise changes to profiles e.g. resulting from matching based on an updated dataset may result two entity profiles being merged into one updated entity profile and therefore the merged entity now has two IDs associated with it. As a result the records that are currently associated with either of the two existing IDs are combined under the updated entity profile. Within this framework of shifting entity profiles updating records and movement of record entity associations customers look for consistency in the resulting aggregated data and analytics. Therefore persistence of associations must be supported to provide consistency while maintaining accuracy across the data sets. Although IDs link records to entities IDs may not be unique in relation to entities. It is possible and common for several ID s to point to one entity. This means that one entity can have several ID s. This happens when new information or algorithmic improvements allow a determination that all or portions of two formerly distinct entities are in fact the same entity. For example ID X points to entity A and ID Y points to entity B and information changes allow us to determine entity A and B are the same and may be called entity AB for simplicity of this example. ID X and ID Y will now both be associated with entity AB in perpetuity to support existing customers. In addition a new ID XY will also be assigned to entity AB to make facilitate tracking of new records that match to entity AB. If entity AB is later split into two separate entities e.g. determined to consist of data from multiple entities ID X Y and XY will be used to track the largest number of records that remain matched to one entity and new IDs will be assigned to the other records. An extension of the ID use may be to keep an audit trail of entity mergers and splits along with ID reassignments.

Persistence of relevant associations of data records to an existing ID is important for customer level views. However due to the dynamic nature of the data records and the matches of records with entities that result from new information that improves entity matching and overall match confidence levels customer level view persistence is handled contextually. Contextual persistence handling may allow accurate associations between records and entities while ensuring that changes to profiles that result in changes to the matches of records to those profiles maintains the greatest share of an existing customer view. Simply put when records that are associated with one entity are split among two or more entities based on a change in the profile or in an understanding of the content of the records match changes the ID that was associates with all of the records maintains an association with the largest newly matched group of records and different IDs are associated with the other records. In an example splitting a matched set of ten records based on a new understanding of the entity profile to which these ten records are matched entity T may result in the profile for entity T being split into two profiles entity T profile and entity T1 profile. The ten records that were associated with profile T were associated through unique ID W. When the ten records are matched to the new profiles six records are determined to be matched with entity T1. As a result unique ID W is designated as now being associated with entity T1 rather than entity T because the majority of the existing matches that are associated with ID W now match entity T1. Consequently the updated profile for entity T and all of its matches will be associated with a different ID.

In this way although the platform can re analyze any dataset and find different results based on the additional entity information that has been collected since the last time a dataset was analyzed clients can be provided a consistency in analysis output over time even while an assessment of the underlying data changes.

Industry or vertical classification may be accomplished by using data associated with a shipping record and or other data sources to determine which industry an entity buyer supplier is associated with. As described above machine learning techniques such as decision trees can be used to classify individual data records.

The customs transaction data can be mined to automatically build training data for vertical classification. Standardized codes such as the Harmonic Tariff System HTS codes embedded in the free text commodity fields can be extracted and used to determine a vertical associated with a record. Along with the HTS code text in the commodity field maybe mined to train a vertical classifier facility. The vertical classifier facility can then be used to predict or determine a vertical classification of customs records. In an example a commodity field of a record may be HTS 6209180 Red cotton pants . The extracted HTS code 6209180 may be determined to be associated with a garments industry vertical. The extracted label red cotton pants may be recognized as apparel in our training data. If red cotton pants is not recognized then it can be added to the apparel training data. Generally only a small fraction of customs data has HTS codes therefore training a classifier and applying the trained commodity entries to new records may facilitate classification of the remainder of the transaction record. Because the vertical classifier may be a self learning facility each new record processed by the classifier can enhance the vertical classifier ability to classify new records. In addition hand labeling of records may be used to improve the vertical classifier training data.

In embodiments a name updater may provide tools to clean the name of a supplier or buyer such as making commas periods capitalization of acronyms fixing common misspellings making common abbreviations and the like consistent. This may be an automated process of cleaning up those names as well as a manual interface to go through groups of names by glancing at them.

Weights may be applied to rating algorithms data and the like in the methods and systems disclosed herein. Weights may be applied in the process of determining ratings so that certain factors that affect a rating may have a greater impact on a rating than other factors. Weights may also be variable and may be based on a combination of factors. Weights may be applied based on a timeliness of data. Timeliness of data may be important to be weighted because for instance very new data may not yet be verified or old data may no longer represent a buyer supplier relationship. Weighting of data may also be important because some data may be of suspect quality independent of age data may not have a high degree of relevance to a rating and many other data quality related factors. In this way weights may be given in the rating process based on timeliness of data size of transaction quality of the transacting parties prior rating of a transacting party or entity relevance of the data. Weighting factors may be based on human aided assessment of an entity financial health of an entity and the like.

An overall rating of a supplier or buyer may be a combination of sub ratings such as rating associated with amount of experience certification dimensions county context business metrics customer loyalty and the like. An overall rating and any sub rating may be weighted normalized and curve fitted to ensure the rating is providing a consistent reliable measure of a supplier buyer and the like. Additionally the weighting may be customer specified to enable a customer to identify portions of the ratings that are most important.

One sub rating metric is customer loyalty. Determining a customer loyalty rating for a supplier is computationally intense and algorithmically rich because it measures how well a supplier is at keeping customers or how well a buyer sticks with a supplier. In some industries such as in apparel it is quite common for buyers to change almost half of their suppliers every year. Understanding the factors that determine how this activity impacts customer loyalty is a key benefit of the present invention.

Customer loyalty may be determined by looking at individual buyer supplier pairs. One technique to determine a customer loyalty rating for a supplier is to determine a customer loyalty rating for each buyer customer of that supplier and then combine the individual ratings. Factors that may impact customer loyalty include a buyer buying pattern buying frequency number of purchases time since first purchase and the like. Each transaction can be analyzed to determine if the buyer is buying from a second supplier and if the purchase is for an item that was previously purchased from a first supplier. In this situation customer loyalty of the first supplier is compromised. However simply measuring transactions may not provide a quality measure of customer loyalty. Factors such as if the first supplier has stopped selling the item that the buyer is now buying from the second supplier are important to include.

Transaction data may often only be available as free text data UPC and other codes may not be included in the records . Therefore the text processing normalization and canonical adaptation techniques described herein may be beneficially applied to determining a customer loyalty rating for a supplier. Certain aspects of buyer supplier relationships may have greater importance than others so exponential weighting on some dimensions may be useful. In an example a longer relationship of fewer transactions may be more important than a large number of transactions over a shorter duration. Factors included in a customer loyalty calculation include duration of relationship count of orders shipments the weight of each order shipment determines size value of shipment and the like. In an example if a buyer buys the same item from two suppliers and consolidates orders to just one of the two suppliers a customer loyalty rating of the other supplier may be significantly impacted because of the known cutoff in the supplier buyer relationship.

For merging records determining an overall rating and other activities and results associated with the platform determining parent subsidiary relationships may be important. In addition to parent subsidiary relationships other relationships may be important in determining overall rating customer loyalty rating and the like. A buyer that switches from one subsidiary to another subsidiary under a single parent may have little impact on the parent rating but may have significant impact on the subsidiary rating.

An aspect of the platform that facilitates determining parent subsidiary relationships may use various sources of information such as business records from Dunn and Bradstreet web news feeds search engine results of business news sites crawling of supplier web sites press releases of suppliers and the like. An acquisition of a subsidiary by a parent may be identified through one or more of these data sources and the parent subsidiary relationship may be factored into overall rating customer loyalty rating merging and the like. Parent subsidiary relationships may also be determined based on predetermined heuristics such as same city similar name same buyer similar name and other heuristic combinations of customs data record elements. Parent subsidiary relationships can be determined for suppliers and for buyers.

In an embodiment details of a supplier may be summarized and coupled if the same supplier has several plants to generate an aggregate profile of the supplier. Likewise if a single buyer buys for several locations it may be considered to be a single buyer and an aggregate profile for the buyer may be generated. For example a supplier of wooden furniture with 5 different distribution locations may be considered as a single supplier. Over a period of time trends between a supplier and a buyer may be captured and such trends may enable an analysis of buyer supplier networks supplier location and buyer location to determine the relationships between various groups of buyers and suppliers. Depending upon the transactions made between a supplier and buyer for several locations a map of relationships among the locations of the suppliers and the locations of the buyers may be developed. In case a buyer and a supplier are constantly engaged with each other through various locations supply and delivery points may be identified on maps which may be helpful in developing a well managed relationship between both the entities. The relationship map among the various locations of the supplier and the buyer is pivotal for efficient management of a supply chain. The managers might be assisted by this map to manage the logistics that in turn may help in minimizing the freight costs time of delivery etc. The mapping of various buyer supplier locations on the map may also help in building a partnership between a buyer and a supplier which may increase a firm s competitiveness. Moreover this mapping may also play an important role in reducing the cycle time specifically the order to delivery lead time which is the time elapsed between the placement of order by the buyer and the delivery of products by the supplier. For example a supplier of electronic components providing a buyer with various products at different locations may be able to map the various factories producing those components. Accordingly he may be able to plan a strategy for managing the supply of those components to the point of delivery in accordance with the distance from the various factories. This may help the electronic component supplier to deliver the components within less time and at a better cost. These maps may also help a buyer to find other suppliers that may be near one of the buyer s locations. The other suppliers may be able to serve the needs of the buyer while also being more cost effective. Further the relationship map may be used by the geographic search functionality as described above to track search various locations of the suppliers and the buyers. For example by using the geographic searching functionality the buyer may further minimize the cost of purchase by searching for a supplier who is nearest to the point of delivery or may be a competitor of the current supplier in the vicinity.

Information derived from the location specific data described above may be valuable to a supplier or buyer so this information may be made available for a fee e.g. a subscription fee a one time use fee and the like . A supplier may pay a fee to reduce shipment and or inventory handling costs. A buyer may pay a fee to receive information that might reduce purchase or shipping related costs.

Using such relationship maps a cohort relationship dataset may be developed which may enable statistical study of relationships between supplier locations and a buyer locations. If a supplier ships the same product from a few different locations and a particular supplier location of that product is rated more highly than other locations a buyer may use the information in business dealings with the supplier.

Referring to depicts a plurality of customs records with details that are relevant to buyer and supplier identification and for merging customs records while avoiding duplication in counting the same transaction as a result of it being characterized in different records. Records and record the same Shipper A Shanghai Bada Textile Consignee B No Fear Inc. and HS Code K 621143 . However the date I is different for each record indicating that while the records may be associated with the same buyer and supplier they are not duplicate entries. Record records the same shipper A as records and . It also records a buyer that may be the same as the buyer of records and through the data in the also notify D field No Fear . Therefore it may be appropriate to conclude that the buyer and seller of record is the same as those in records and . However because the HS code K 621149 is not the same record is not a duplicate of or . Record records a potential buyer in consignee B No Fear that may be the same as the buyer in records and . However because the shipper A Guangzhou Textile Co may be identified as a different supplier than the shipper in records and it may be readily determined that record is not only not a duplicate of and but it also identifies a different supplier buyer relationship.

Referring to a customs data user interface that may facilitate selecting among a plurality of potential buyer names that are provided in customs records . The interface may include one or more buyer name use buttons or some other type of selection means for selecting which field in each of the customs records represents a buyer name. As described in reference to buyer identity candidate fields may include consignee B the notify party C and the also notify D fields. The buyer name use buttons may be associated with each field in the buyer identity candidate fields so that an operator of the platform may signal which buyer identity data item associated with each customs record should be used for merging de duplication and other actions within the platform. The customs data user interface is only exemplary and other arrangements of buttons data fields and the like as well as various presentations of the data before and after selection are possible and herein included.

A name chooser tool such as the one described above and depicted in may assist with identifying a buyer name or supplier name in a record. The tool may allow a user to manually identify a buyer seller shipper and the like for each transaction records. As described herein there may be automated processes to deal with entity identification in transaction records. Automated or manual processes use key words like logistics trading company and shipping company to distinguish shippers from buyers or suppliers.

The user data interface may include a toolbar that may be customized according to a user s need. This customized toolbar may provide a personalized experience to each user. For example the user may introduce new check buttons for products which help in filtering the results in accordance with the products provided by various suppliers. Similarly the user may introduce various buttons to customize a search. The user may also use various elements from the list of favorites marked by the user during his previous searches. Elements present in the list may be grabbed and dragged to the screen by the user such that these elements may be used during the subsequent searches. Similarly suggestions may also be made for similar suppliers and a real time match may also be found for them.

In an embodiment a tool may be provided that allows data to be viewed as a table or to be exported to another application such as MS Excel. A table view may display specific details of a particular company or a combination of companies e.g. buyers and suppliers . The table view may facilitate viewing information pertaining to a company such as various attributes including without limitation a supplier s shipment history the types of materials typically shipped a supplier s customers a supplier s expertise what materials and how much a buyer purchases buyer and shipper reliability similarity between buyers similarity between suppliers shipments that match a particular term and the like. The data table view may be viewed or exported conveniently by manual clicking a link command icon in a user interface.

Relationships among companies may be viewed in the table view based on a filter of company specific attributes e.g. for a given product . For example filtering of companies may be done on the basis of the number of shipments matching a product such as hammers. This filtering may allow presentation in a table view a number of companies that share the same number of shipments and receipts of hammers over a defined period of time thereby showing a supplier or suppliers and a buyer or buyers who have transacted Hammers . The companies in the results of this initial filtering may be further compared by providing a compare button e.g. in a user interface that supports the table view which may be clicked to compare a selected subset of results. Alternatively dragging one or more of the entities in the results list to a comparison region or icon of a data view user interface may activate the comparison. A toolbar may be provided such that after clicking the compare button the toolbar folds up. For example a user may select elements for comparison such as a group of entities and a term e.g. Hammers and a compare function may provide a tabular view of the comparison of suppliers that meet the selected comparison criteria in accordance with the above description.

The methods and systems described herein may include user interfaces that may include support for various languages and may further include a multi language user communication system. A multi language user communication system may for example use location information to present information to the user in the user s native language even if the information was entered in a different language. In addition the look and feel of the user interface presented to a user may differ based on user current location user home location user language preference and the like. The language and design elements may be changed depending on these and other aspects of a user s location.

The multi language user communication system may provide a translation facility that may allow a supplier and a buyer without a common language to communicate. Translation services may be real time or may be delayed for processing. The translation may be automatically generated or may be manually provided through the use of interpreters. A different level of service with a different degree of accuracy guarantee may be provided on a fee basis. I included this elsewhere The multi language user communication system may provide a method for communicating with a shipping company in a user s native language.

In an example the option button corresponding to Shanghai Bada Textile may be selected along with the check box showing Shanghai Bada Textile Co. Subsequently the variation in the names of the buyer can be merged.

Referring to the search may also be conducted to obtain information regarding the various entities such as suppliers and buyers . The computer implemented facility may collect and store a plurality of public records of transactions among a plurality of buyers and suppliers . The transactions may be aggregated and associated with the entities suppliers and or buyers . A user interface may be provided that may facilitate a user who may be searching for at least one of the entities and the information associated with the at least one of the entities from the aggregated transactions data. The user may be any person interested in retrieving the above information the user may also be a supplier a buyer a third party and the like. The examples of user interface may include a Graphical User Interface Web based User Interface Touch Interface and some other types of user interfaces.

In an embodiment the user interface may facilitate a tuple based search . The tuple based search relates to a capability of searching for entities related to a specific parameter. Such parameter may relate to a product a material and or a technique . In an example a supplier S1 may like to conduct a search for buyers available in the United States for Aluminum based packaging sheets formed by extrusion. 

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the search results obtained from the above described searches for the entities may also be ranked. In an embodiment the ranking may be based on a supplier rating.

In an embodiment the rating may be based on the context of a party the business legitimacy of a party an assessment based on the trading environment of a country macroeconomic information industry awards industry certifications amount of experience number of shipments duration of experience size of transactions extent of domestic experience extent of international experience caliber of customers customer loyalty degree of specialization specialization in product categories specialization in manufacturing techniques specialization in materials specialization in gender feedback from customers feedback from buyers feedback on product quality feedback on customer service feedback on timeliness of delivery feedback on language skills feedback on sample making ability respect for intellectual property quality management social responsibility environmental responsibility standards of compliance certifications certifications with respect to specific vendor standards risk profile opportunity profile and some other types of factors and parameters.

Referring to the above example again upon searching a supplier may obtain a list of buyers which may be interested in buying Aluminum based packaging sheets formed by extrusion . In addition the supplier may like to ascertain the best buyers. For this purpose the supplier may also obtain a ranking of the buyers based on selected parameters such as feedback reports risk associated with each buyer geographical location and some other type of parameter. The rating may be in the form of a value integer percentage and some other forms of ratings. Based on this rating a ranking may be provided to each of the buyers . This ranking may in turn facilitate the supplier in making the judgment regarding the appropriate buyer. Risk may be related to counterfeiting capacity subcontracting political factor geographic factor weather factor geology factor financial risk probability of non performance of a contract probability of termination of a contract intellectual property targeted delivery date transactional customs data for a party other than the supplier and or buyer likelihood that a buyer will move to an alternative supplier non payment and some other types of risk factors.

An opportunity profile may be an assessment of the potential for new business opportunities determined from customs transaction data. By analyzing transactions in customs data buyers and suppliers can identify potential business opportunities such as to establish a new relationship reduce costs increase availability and the like. While companies guard much of their internal information related to costs and profit the transaction information available in public customs records can provide great insight into ongoing buy and sell activity. In an example of opportunity profile assessment a buyer may decide there is an opportunity to push a supplier harder to reduce a price. The buyer may be able to determine that the supplier has made fewer sales e.g. as evidenced by lower shipment quantities in customs transaction records over time. One potential reason for this is that a competitor of the supplier is offering a lower price. Therefore the supplier may need to reduce price to remain competitive. Likewise the supplier can review the same records and determine that the competitor is selling at a lower price under certain conditions so the supplier can device a counter pricing strategy accordingly. In another example a supplier may spot an opportunity to sell additional types of products to an existing buyer by examining the transactions of the buyer. The supplier may determine that the buyer is purchasing a type of product from a competitor that the supplier also offers but is not currently selling to the buyer. The supplier could provide the buyer with the opportunity to potentially improve the buyer costs by ordering the product from the supplier rather than the competitor. Factors such as combined volume pricing reduced accounting overhead lower shipping costs and the like may be key benefits that the supplier can use to entice the buyer.

Likewise the platform or an operator of the platform may use the customs transactional data to identify and suggest opportunities to buyers and or suppliers. The transactional data may be analyzed for factors that indicate the potential for an opportunity and the opportunity may be prepared as an offer to one or more of buyers suppliers and the like. Opportunities may include availability of pricing leverage for a buyer with respect to a supplier consolidation of orders with a supplier pricing leverage for a supplier with respect to a buyer increasing a share of a buyer s total spending for a supplier and the like.

A risk profile may be determined based on analysis of customs transaction data. A risk profile for a supplier or a buyer may be based on customs transaction data for the supplier the buyer or a third party. A risk profile that may be determined from customs transactional data may include risk related to counterfeiting capacity overload subcontracting political factors geographic factors weather geology finances probability of non performance to a contract probability of termination of a contract intellectual property achieving a targeted delivery date non payment selecting an alternate supplier order cancellation order push out and the like. A risk profile that may be derived from customs transaction data may be a basis for determining terms and conditions of insurance and the like.

The above description disclosed that the search interface may be utilized for searching entities based on the aggregated transactional data. In an embodiment the suppliers may also be searched based on the region of interest geography industry specialization customers entity types and the interest displayed in forming relationship likelihood of interest . This may be explained in detail in conjunction with .

Referring to again the computer implemented facility may collect and store the public transaction records and associate these transactions with the entities . A search facility may search for an entity based on a particular search attribute . The search attribute may be a type of entity geographic region industry specialization and likelihood of interest in a transaction with the user or the search .

In embodiments the search facility may be adapted to be used by a buyer for searching a supplier. Alternately the search facility may also be adapted to be used by a supplier for searching a buyer.

In an example a buyer may like to search for suppliers in US of automotive machine parts that may be willing to do business with a small offshore firm outside United States. Therefore in the above scenario the likelihood of interest that the suppliers may display may be based on the location and size of the firm.

In embodiments methods and systems disclosed herein may include an interface by which buyers may search for suppliers as disclosed above. The search interface may allow buyers to query a database of supplier information organized in a hierarchy according to product categories in order to find suppliers who provide products in a selected category. A buyer may then select particular suppliers and obtain an online profile or report as described throughout this disclosure as to attributes of a particular supplier. In embodiments the search interface allows the buyer to search by product category material used to make the product or technique used to make the product among other attributes. Filtering tools may be provided in the interface to allow the buyer to sort data by product type material technique caliber of customer or other attributes to expand or group data to drill down into particular categories or sub categories and the like.

In embodiments the database of supplier information includes an ontology of product categories which may include a tree of categories and sub categories of all types of products found in various data sources such as customs records databases.

In embodiments filters may be enabled allowing a buyer to search along dimensions of the data. In an example if a buyer wishes to search for suppliers who work with a particular material a filtering algorithm may take the union of all materials used by suppliers and present those materials as filters by which a set of suppliers may be selected by buyers for further analysis. The filters may be presented in a graph or tree structure so that a user may check a box to expand or contract a particular portion of the tree thereby allowing filtering by sub category down to the leaf node in a tree. In embodiments data are represented in tuples and results for a particular filter are ordered such as by overall rating of the supplier. Results for a particular filter may also be ordered by other features such as most specialized and the like.

Filters may include construction techniques dyeing washing and embellishing techniques gender of the product company type country of supplier and the like. When data are represented in tuples all products a supplier has made may be represented by material sub material and technique e.g. cotton poplin knitted sweater . In an example when a search is conducted for a cotton poplin sweater the suppliers who have made cotton poplin sweaters can be retrieved not the union of ones who have made cotton or poplin sweaters in this example . The tuple concept applies to children of each concept in a hierarchy so if the user selects cotton the user will receive results for cotton and all children of cotton in the materials hierarchy.

In embodiments the search interface may include a non tuple based search mode in which suppliers would be suggested as possible matches for the user s query that would be the union of the search terms. In an example if a supplier has worked with silk and has produced pants the system predicts that this supplier could make silk pants.

In embodiments a user interface may include paid or sponsored links in addition to search results derived from the rating platform described herein.

In embodiments methods and systems disclosed herein may include private and public versions of reports where a searcher can get to a public profile by an Internet site but requires some additional relationship possibly involving payment in order to drill down to receive more information such as a complete profile of a supplier.

In embodiments various icons filters sliders or other techniques may be provided in a user interface to allow a user to explore information about a supplier. In embodiments a user can click for details thereby pulling up a ranking a supplier has for a given dimension with information about the data source and a reminder of the purpose of that dimension. In embodiments icons may show if a score is high medium or low thereby bucketing suppliers into general categories. In embodiments filters or sliders may allow users to refine results such as to show suppliers only if the product in question represents at least a minimum percentage of that supplier s product mix.

In an embodiment the user interface may facilitate a search based on a geographic radius such that a plurality of entities may be searched based upon the related address of a given entity e.g. a buyer or a supplier or area around a given address e.g. area around Michigan . In an example a buyer may like to conduct a search for suppliers available near a supplier which is in the San Francisco area in the United States. The result of this search may include all the suppliers in the given area within a predefined distance e.g. 5 Kms from the searched supplier who may supply a specific product that may also be supplied by the searched supplier. The search region distance factor may be based on various aspects such as driving distance jurisdiction county state and it may also be submitted by the user as a parameter of the search. The search results may also be ranked e.g. based on a supplier rating .

In another embodiment a buyer may obtain a list of suppliers which are in the vicinity of a supplier which may be providing wooden furniture . In addition the buyer may like to receive certain details of all the suppliers listed in the search result. For this purpose a more summarized view of the profile of the suppliers may be provided directly in the search result. In an embodiment the rating may be an icon integer and the like. Based on this a rank may be associated with each of the suppliers . This ranking may in turn facilitate well informed decision making for the buyer regarding the appropriate supplier. Risk may be related to political factor in a particular area geographic factor weather factor geology factor targeted delivery date and some other types of risk factors.

Supplier and buyer search may be further enhanced to take advantage of the profile characteristics described above as well as other characteristics including those derived from additional data sources such as public operational data financial metrics social responsibility certifications black list data user generated feedback and the like. Company search may include searching for suppliers from a particular market or markets that serve a particular market or markets U.S. or European buyers of furniture from Indonesia . Search may include searching for suppliers from a particular market or markets who source from a particular market or markets Vietnamese furniture suppliers who buy wood from china . Alternatively searching may include searching for buyers from a particular market or markets that buy from a particular market or markets furniture suppliers from Indonesia that serve the U.S. or Canada . Additionally natural language processing based search may facilitate automatically determining whether a user is looking for a set of buyers or a set of suppliers or for a particular company.

As described herein user interface may be provided which may include a search box. Natural language e.g. English may be entered in the search for searching various entities. Natural language keyword or keywords entered in the search box may automatically be detected. Search aspects such as whether the user is searching for buyers suppliers and the like may also be detected while the user is entering the data in the search box even without pressing a search icon or button. Such automated detection may be done depending upon the time of the day user s location user s company domain and the keywords. In an aspect filtering may be performed by a variety of filter type algorithms. Filtering may be done on the basis of regions countries. For example regions or and countries may be captured from each of two records and compared when the regions match between the records the records may be identified as potential candidates for further processing such as classification and clustering.

In embodiments an interface may be provided for rating a supplier such as on dimensions including an overall rating product quality customer service timeliness English language capability sample making ability respect for intellectual property and the like. Buyer ratings may be averaged or otherwise normalized and reported as part of a supplier s overall rating . In embodiments transactional data may be used to ensure that a transaction occurred to keep ratings unpolluted . If a buyer rating is good this can give a significant boost to an overall rating .

In embodiments buyers could specify which dimensions are most important to them and the overall rating could be customized and weighted according to the buyer s preferences.

In embodiments suppliers may be suggested to buyers based on the types of qualities the buyer seems to appreciate and the types of products the buyer has produced in the past.

The capability to identify and classify various buyers and suppliers as friends or the like may also be facilitated by using public transaction records as shown in . The examples of public records may be government registration records evidences of business legitimacy custom records data sheets and reports for work order audit records bank records and some other types of public records depicting various transactions. This may in turn help both the buyers and the suppliers to identify similar buyers and suppliers and in turn help them make decisions regarding collaborations competition and some other types of strategic positioning.

Referring to a computer implemented facility may be used to collect and store public records of transactions . The public records may be government registration records evidences of business legitimacy custom records data sheets and reports for work order audit records bank records and some other types of public records depicting various transactions. The transaction records may be associated with various entities such as corporations items buyers suppliers third parties etc. and may generate information that may be aggregated transaction information transactions associated with said entities . An analysis may be performed for classification of entities . The classification may be a likeness based classification . The likeness based classification may indicate that the suppliers buyers and the third parties may be classified according to the type or degree of likeness types of qualities appreciated past experience or some other characterization parameter. It may be noted that the classification may be conducted to classify at least one of a supplier and a buyer according to any one of the characterization parameters.

In embodiments a buyer may identify like similar buyers. Similarly a supplier may identify similar suppliers.

In other embodiments a supplier may identify buyers like those of the supplier. A buyer may also identify suppliers like those of the buyer.

In embodiments a buyer may identify suppliers of a specified type. Further a supplier may identify buyers of a specified type.

In embodiments a buyer may identify suppliers most likely to prefer a particular buyer. Similarly a supplier may identify buyers that would prefer a specific supplier.

In embodiments the public records of transactions may also be used for classification of buyers . This has been explained in conjunction with . The public records of transactions stored in the computer implemented facility may store transaction records relating to various suppliers and buyers . The information associated with the public records of transactions in relation to various entities may be further analyzed. Based on the analysis buyer classification may be performed to classify various entities identified in the transactions into buyers category. It may be appreciated that the above described process and the system may also be used for classification of various entities into suppliers category supplier classification .

In embodiments an interface may include a capability for buyers to network chat or otherwise interact with each other with respect to suppliers. Such a network may include a capability of identifying other buyers as friends or the like thereby allowing sharing of information only among trusted parties. In such a case information about suppliers for particular buyers might be automatically populated simplifying the sharing of information about experiences with particular suppliers used by a network of buyers.

In embodiments analyses could be used to assess and or identify credit worthiness of suppliers or buyers.

In embodiments ratings could be embedded into other media such as other websites emails print media and the like. Such embeddings could be a result of calls to an Application Programming Interface API or other methods.

In embodiments ratings may be grouped into buckets such as excellent good fair poor and not trade worthy. Various methods may be used to group suppliers into such buckets. In an example excellent ratings may be given to suppliers who have business legitimacy and are in the top quartile in both loyalty and experience good ratings may be given to suppliers who have business legitimacy and are in the top half in both loyalty and experience fair ratings may be given to suppliers who have business legitimacy and are in the top half in either loyalty or experience poor ratings may be given to other suppliers who have business legitimacy and not trade worthy ratings may be given to suppliers who do not have indicia of business legitimacy.

In embodiments methods and systems disclosed herein may assist suppliers in generating leads among buyers for opportunities to supply products. Information about how to improve ratings may be used to assist suppliers in generating high quality leads.

The methods and systems of the platform may facilitate identifying a supplier of an item type that is disclosed in a transaction record even if the supplier is not a party to the transaction. Identifying a supplier of an item or a type of item may benefit buyers suppliers and the like by identifying potential new relationships between buyers and suppliers. A buyer may use the resulting supplier identification and other information in transaction records such as declared customs value to compare a current supplier cost with a different supplier cost for the same item. A buyer or a potential buyer may use at least transaction cost and delivery information to identify suppliers from which the buyer may request a quote for supplying the item. Suppliers may identify buyers of products that the supplier also provides. This may lead to efficient marketing and sales activity for the supplier because the supplier would know that buyer has a significant interest in the item being purchased. By examining other information in the transaction such as buyer behavior transaction history and the like the supplier may identify an offer profile of the buyer and present a very well targeted offer to the buyer.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the information from the aggregated transactions may also be utilized for supplier assessment. Supplier assessment may involve determining if a specific buyer has ceased business operations with a supplier. Such a determination may be based on a cycle time between shipments which may be based on historical shipment data derived from transaction records. A calculation of cycle time of shipments for an item from a supplier to a buyer may indicate an approximate date of a next shipment. If a transaction record reflecting the next shipment does not show up in the transaction records within some period of time beyond the indicated next shipment date the methods and systems may indicate that the buyer may have stopped business operations with the supplier. The nature of the stoppage may be further determined if transaction records indicate that the buyer has begun receiving shipments of the item from a different supplier. Cycle time calculations may also be used to evaluate a supplier s delivery performance. Significant increases in cycle time may indicate delay of shipment by the supplier. An assessment of supplier buyer transaction status may also include factoring in buyer inventory. Buyer inventory may be factored in as a prediction or estimate of inventory.

In an embodiment of the present invention methods and systems may be provided for rating an entity based on rolled up customs data. Rolled up customs data may include aggregated cumulative summary or similar methods of combining a series of transactions into roll up data. Rolled up data may include a total of shipments over a period of time for a buyer seller product association. Rolled up data may include total shipments over a period of time for product shipper association. Any and all types of consolidation of transaction data that may be based on a time interval a frequency a region an industry a product a supplier a buyer a shipper a source region an exchange rate and the like are herein included. In an example rolled up transaction data may include a supplier s total output in each product category over a calendar month. In another example a country may report a total export of a product during a week. In both cases critical transaction information that may be missing may be estimated or predicted in order to develop otherwise useful information from the rolled up information. The computer implemented facility may collect and store the rolled up public records of transactions and aggregate them to form aggregated transactions.

Further the aggregated transaction records may be associated with a particular supplier. This associated information may be analyzed to determine and convey the rating for the supplier.

It may be appreciated that this procedure may be conducted periodically In an example every three months . In another embodiment the change in rating of a specific supplier may be presented as an alert.

In an example the embodiments described above may be utilized by a company dealing in an improved form of pesticide that may wish to determine the ratings of a specific supplier of raw materials situated in a different country. Therefore the aggregated and associated shipment transaction information regarding the shipment time schedule price and delivery for the supplier may be used to determine its rating among a plurality of similar suppliers. Subsequently this rating may be instrumental in helping the above company make supply related business decisions.

The public records of transactions may also be utilized for predicting minimum order requirements for a factory. Referring to the computer implemented facility may collect a plurality of public transaction records . The collection step may be performed by a collection facility . The collected records may be stored by a storage facility . Upon collection and storage the plurality of public transaction records may be aggregated by the aggregation facility and associated with various entities .

In an example information regarding the public transaction records such as transaction receipts for a candle supplier selling a batch of factory made candlesticks from a candle manufacturer may be aggregated and associated by the computer implemented facility . The analysis facility may perform detailed analysis of this information to generate various types of results. In an embodiment the analysis facility may predict the minimum order requirement for an entity based on the analysis of the transactions. As described in the above example the analysis facility may predict the number of batches that the candle manufacturer may need to sell in order to cross the minimum profit mark. In another example the analysis facility may predict the minimum number of candle stick batches that may need to be supplied to a third party in order to fulfill the required terms laid down in a mutual contract. In yet another scenario the analysis facility may also facilitate predicting the minimum order requirements that a subsidiary of a supplier may need to supply among the batch of suppliers.

In embodiments methods and systems are disclosed herein for using disparate data sources including transactional records such as from customs transactions as a basis for rating suppliers of products. In embodiments transactional data from actual transactions are used to generate experience ratings specialization ratings customer loyalty ratings or other ratings.

In embodiments a rating system is provided in which buyers rate suppliers of products wherein transactional data such as from customs records are used to verify the legitimacy of the feedback such as to verify that a rated transaction actually occurred.

In embodiments methods and systems allow buyers to search for suppliers including with filters based on product category material or techniques offered or used by the suppliers and to retrieve ratings information about the suppliers including ratings derived from transactional data such as customs data or ratings derived from other buyers.

In embodiments a platform for enabling searches for suppliers and ratings of suppliers may include various tools such as tools for merging records merging supplier names and the like.

In embodiments methods and systems disclosed herein may include a quote tool by which buyers may identify suppliers and then generate a request for a quote from selected suppliers.

In embodiments algorithms may be used for determining a pricing leverage metric such as based on transactional data such as customs records. In an example a supplier s pricing leverage may depend on the percentage of a supplier s shipments that are going to a single buyer the proximity to a recent switch in supplier by one or more buyers a supplier s overall score a supplier s customer loyalty score a supplier s experience in an area and global factors such as overall demand for a product offered by a supplier. Thus an interface may allow buyers to assess pricing leverage based on calculations using one or more of these factors normalized or weighted to provide an overall estimate or score as to pricing leverage of a supplier.

In embodiments access to the database may be restricted by the capacity of a supplier and the ability of a supplier to ship small quantities. For instance large buyers may need access to the entire database while smaller buyers may need special access to suppliers that specialize in smaller orders.

A user interface may include various alerts such as an alert for when a new supplier satisfies a search criterion of a buyer.

In an embodiment alerts may be generated in order to notify the user in case any pre set condition becomes true or any new information is added with respect to a product or supplier etc. i.e. an alert may be generated in case new data is added with respect to a buyer in which the user may be interested. In case new data is added with respect to a company the company may be marked or red flagged to indicate that certain change has been made with regard to it. For example a buyer B1 who buys Beddings from suppliers namely S1 S2 and S3 now starts buying from supplier S4 the company B1 may be red flagged and an alert may be generated to notify supplier S1 that a new supplier is also supplying to B1. According S1 may make a new bid or change his strategy towards B1. In an aspect various types of alerts may be generated depending upon the need of the user. Another example may be cited wherein an alert is generated when there are new results to a search. For example an alert may be set in case a new supplier or another shipment of hammers is added to Ikea China. In this case the user shall receive an alert when another supplier another shipment of hammers is added to the profile of Ikea China. Moreover in case the user has already seen an alert another alert shall not be sent in this regard.

Alerts may also be set for tracking a particular company for example an alert may be set for a buyer B1 in case a new supplier starts supplying to the same an alert may be sent. This may help with competitive intelligence for a company both as a buyer as well as a supplier as it may help a company to know more about various other organizations. This information may be useful for decision makers of the company. For example a buyer may track his supplier and may be notified in case the supplier starts supplying to a competitor which may be breach their contractual agreement. Another example may be cited wherein an alert may be generated in case a new supplier starts supplying in a particular region. In addition data alerts may be set for companies that undergo a drastic change in a particular characteristic relating to it. For example an alert may be set if a particular buyer starts buying less than a fixed quantity of products.

Alerts may be set on data present in various databases and not limited to customs database and alerts may also be set for data stored in a Red Flag Database which may trigger a negative alert. Alerts based on different databases may be helpful in generating and noting a trend related to a particular supplier buyer product etc. For example macro trends may be noted by tacking a product from analyzing the shipping data. Market share of various countries or any change in the market share may also be known which may help suppliers to target buyers.

Furthermore IP alerts may also be set notifying the user in case a buyer supplier starts importing exporting a product which may be protected by a patent of the user.

In an embodiment alerts may be generated by analyzing data related to a particular entity and which is stored in a database such as customs records shipper records etc. An alert may be of help to managers of various companies who may take actions depending upon the alert generated. For example consignee data may be analyzed to generate alerts when a supplier serves a new buyer. In another example shipper data may be used to generate alerts when a company orders goods from a new country and or region.

A supplier of a particular commodity may be alerted when new suppliers start supplying in a particular region. For example a furniture supplier to south east Asia may be notified when a new furniture supplier starts supplying in Vietnam. Likewise a supplier may also be notified in case a new buyer of a particular product starts buying in from a particular region which may help the supplier to target the new buyer.

Furthermore in case a search gives new results due to any changes in the stored data an alert may be generated. For example when a buyer s or supplier s risk metric changes the various users may be notified this may help a user to take action. In an aspect an alert may be generated requesting feedback from a buyer about a supplier when a shipment from said supplier is received.

Methods and systems disclosed herein may include methods for syndicating data such as delivering overall scores category ratings e.g. excellent good fair or poor or the like to third parties such as for presentation in connection with other business data such as data presented to securities analysts data presented to buyers for other purposes and the like. Users will be able to provide subjective ratings of suppliers on such third party presentations using an API.

In embodiments methods and systems disclosed herein may include collaborative filtering techniques such as to allow buyers to see information relevant to other buyers who share characteristics with the buyer such as conducting similar searches using similar suppliers or having similar transaction records . Collaborative filtering may also allow suppliers to access information relevant to other suppliers with similar characteristics such as ratings for suppliers to supply the same types of products to the same types of buyers and the like.

In embodiments a buyer scorecard may be provided that shows summary data for a supply chain of various suppliers such as to indicate how the buyer s suppliers collectively compare to suppliers of other buyers such as competitors of the buyer.

In embodiments ratings of suppliers or buyers as described throughout this disclosure may be used for third parties such as in embodiments financial analysts. In an example an analyst could evaluate the quality of a company s supply chain based on collective supplier ratings. Similarly an insurance company could use data about suppliers of a buyer to assess supply chain risk such as for analyzing risk associated with insurance associated with activities of suppliers.

In embodiments buyers may supply data to the platform described herein in order to assist with developing ratings but that data may be maintained as proprietary to the buyer such as to keep ratings generated based on that data private to the buyer.

In embodiments information about suppliers may be syndicated to desk software tools such as tools used by purchasing managers and buying staff within buyer organizations. Thus reports or ratings may be fed so that they appear within the interface of one or more other desktop or web based tools used by such users.

In embodiments methods and systems disclosed herein may include filtering tools for sorting data retrieved from customs records according to an industry hierarchy such as a hierarchy of products materials and techniques.

In embodiments a search interface may allow for a search based on supplier capability such as based on information retrieved from transactional data such as customs records.

In embodiments a data analytics platform may be provided for analyzing supplier capabilities such as based at least in part on transactional data about supplier activities such as transactional data from customs records.

In embodiments a rating system may be based on a combination of customs data and other data such as data based on an internal database of transactions made by an agent on behalf of buyers transacting with suppliers.

In embodiments a platform may include a transactional facility such as for allowing buyers to transact with suppliers that have been identified by the search and ratings facilities described herein. Such transactional facility may include modules related to ordering pricing payment fulfillment and the like.

Referring to in accordance with the methods and systems described herein the public records of transactions may be utilized for rating a sub entity of a supplier . The computer implemented facility may collect and store the public transaction records among the plurality of buyers and suppliers . Upon aggregating and associating the transactions with the entities such as buyers and suppliers an analysis may be performed regarding the sub entities of the suppliers . Examples of sub entities may include a factory a group of factories subsidiaries and some other types of entities.

In an example the aggregated transactions information may reveal a .list of twenty entities doing business in an uptown market. A searcher may utilize the methods and systems disclosed herein to determine a list of seven entities that may be sub entities for a specific supplier S1. In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention these seven entities may be rated based on the transactional data. The seven entities say 2 factories 3 subsidiaries and 2 sales divisions may be rated based on the timeliness of the delivery feedback from the buyers and so on.

In an embodiment the analysis facility may determine the sub entities for a supplier from the group of entities. The determination of sub entities may be based on the analysis of the public transaction records . In an embodiment the public transaction records may be customs transaction records.

In another embodiment the sub entities of the supplier may be rated based on the analysis of the aggregated transactions and other information and parameters as explained throughout the disclosure.

Methods and systems of the present invention may allow a client to make financial investment decisions based on data that is aggregated from a wide variety of different sources such as customs data international trade data suppliers buyers intermediaries agents partner country data domestic production data world commodity prices shipping data import data export data credit based data e.g. Dun Bradstreet certification data various industry and tracking indices regulatory data watchdog agency data industry self regulating data securities trading data tax records and the like.

Financial investments may include assessing and managing risk therefore the aggregated data may be used to determine various risks associated with a financial decision. Risks may be related to a capacity to execute a large order subcontracting arrangements or terms socio economic environment of a country regulatory risk tax risk political risk currency fluctuation non performance of a contract an uncertainty related to termination of the contract achieving target delivery dates intellectual property and compliance of regulatory environment prevalent in the country where the transaction is likely to take place trade routes and the like. Risk assessments for various financial decisions may include assessing entities to be considered for doing business amount of payment to be paid in advance to a supplier amount of insurance to purchase and the like.

The aggregate data may include information that allows organization of the data based on industry affiliation as may be determined from analysis of the data. In an example organization based on various industries such as apparel retail industry electronics industry and the like is possible. Further by determining industry affiliations of the data from the various data sources a user may select an entity name such as BANANA REPUBLIC GAP OLD NAVY and the like and based on the industry affiliations of the selected name found in the data the platform may aggregate and provide analysis of the one or more industry affiliations associated with the selected name. In this example apparel may be one of the industries affiliated with GAP so data from the various data sources that includes references to the apparel industry may be processed.

In addition the client may be allowed to identify and aggregate data based on different locations subsidiaries affiliations and other legal relationships of an organization. For example the client may wish to compare sales of an organization X in various locations. By combining data from the various data sources and matching data in the combined sources based on entity identifiers in the data the sales for the organization may be determined based on states countries regions other locations and the like. By identifying the various locations of the organization in addition to determining the sales attributed to the individual locations the client may also build an aggregate profile for the organization based on the individual location data.

The platform may support determining a profile for each entity matched in the data sources. The platform may also support the creation and maintenance of meta profiles that may include any combination of individual entity profiles an industry profile a geographic region profile and the like. In this way the data can be processed based on the profile or meta profile being selected for analysis.

While data sources may provide information that can be matched to entities some data sources may not include specific entity identifiers. Industry standards data sources such as indices e.g. shipping cost data may be applicable to activities such as shipping but may not directly include entity data. The platform may determine appropriate relationships between this entity less data and specific entities by comparing certain data aspects of the data that can be associated with a specific entity. In an example a company that is identified in customs data as receiving products that were shipped from via sea freight may be associated with a shipping index e.g. Baltic Dry Index for purposes of predicting shipping costs and the like for the company. By comparing freight costs for two companies that both ship via sea freight it may be possible to establish a relative ranking in shipping cost performance of different organizations that may be useful in financial decision making.

By analyzing shipment data sales data public financial records of entities and the like the platform may predict financial performance factors for an entity such as an estimate of inventory that may be based on financial statement of the organization past deliveries and the like. Data sources that may be used for such a prediction may include government registration records custom records earning reports data sheets and some other types of public records depicting various transactions of an organization. Such predictions may also help estimate a company s potential change in earnings in the future.

By combining product shipment related information e.g. as may be determined from customs transaction records with other company and industry sales and financial data growth of a new product may be tracked and predictions of the future sales of the product or financial performance of entities associated with the supply chain of the new product may be estimated.

The information from non transaction data sources may help in establishing a supplier or buyer rating. In an example if a supplier is flagged with a fraudulent charge such as money laundering and the like the overall score of the supplier may be lowered. Also such a change in rating may be communicated to a buyer partner banker and the like of the supplier to facilitate managing risk associated with doing business with the supplier. Similarly when matching public financial reporting data to a buyer s entity profile negatively impacts a rating of a buyer suppliers who may extend credit to the buyer may desire to be notified for purposes of making financial decisions regarding the buyer.

Further customs records may include details about a bank and or shipping organization that is participating in the customs transaction international shipment . Therefore financial risk may be determined for these third parties associated with a customs transaction not just the buyers and sellers . In addition based on this data it may be possible to predict levels of risk for any of the parties participating in customs transactions based on risk profiles of any of the other parties. If a bank that is identified in customs records is in default then ratings for the suppliers of the goods in the transaction may be negatively impacted based on the risk of the bank not following through on a loan obligation of the transaction.

When data from a variety of data sources are matched to entities it may be possible to compare the performance of two or more different organizations. For example data relating to total earnings of the organizations latest products of the organizations and the like may obtained from publicly available financial databases. In embodiments the financial data may be utilized for comparing the performance of the two organizations. To this aspect the coverage ratios liquidity ratios and other financial ratio may be compared. Similarly the computer implemented facility may compare the intangible assets to obtain an estimate on the performance of the two organizations. When evaluating products launched by the organizations factors such as the number of samples of the new product brought into market sales of the new product backlog of the new product lead time of the new product and the like may be compared for assessing the performance of the two organizations.

Data from the data sources may be assigned a weight such as a confidence factor when being used for making financial related decisions. The weight may be based on the size or number of the transactions carried out by organizations. Weights may be based on the confidence of data associated with the suppliers buyers with whom the organizations are transacting and the like. In this way the analysis of entities may be based on the weights associated with data matched to the entities.

As described earlier data may be analyzed for industries marketplaces regions businesses groups of businesses lists of businesses types of businesses e.g. domestic or multi national and the like. This analysis may be called macro level analysis because it may be independent of any specific entity while using information matched to entities that are included in the macro level. Macro level analysis may facilitate detecting trends which may for example help identify hot locations for purchase of specific products or services. For example macro level analysis may identify a trend that indicates a specific location may be a hot spot for manufacturing electric engines. Because the macro level analysis may include data from traditional transaction type data and non transaction data the analysis may be inherently validated because of the use of various independent data sources. Tools may be provided that may facilitate integration of macro level data with the entity specific data to forecast entity performance.

In an embodiment data may be aggregated from a variety of sources including without limitation customs data associated with actual import export transactions private or semi private data e.g. shipper or logistics provider data macro data e.g. a variety of parameters that are associated with economic and political situation of a country and the like. It may be particularly helpful to utilize the range of data sources to provide business profile e.g. rank and risk profiles for an industry a region a country a business district and the like.

In addition to macro data impacting supplier and or buyer ratings macro data may also be used or generated for a region that may facilitate providing a rating e.g. business risk credit risk etc for the region. Macro type data may include without limitation a country context of a party whether a party is registered with government authorities an assessment of a trading environment in a country macroeconomic information currency fluctuation and the like. The rank and risk profiles for an industry a region a country a business district and the like may be related to factors such as political geographic climatic geological financial risks intellectual property and the like. In an example the macro data factors that may impact risk for an industry a region a country a business district and the like may include variables such as GNI per capita currency volatility cost to export political stability and the like. A macro data user interface may allow selection of parameters e.g. GNI per capita and cost to export to generate a country context value that could be applied to calculate a rating for a region country and the like. Furthermore determination of regional rating may depend partially or completely on some or all of the macro data selected from some or all the groups as described herein and elsewhere.

In embodiments a rating for the risk of doing business in a country is provided which may be based on macro data aggregated from transactional customs data customs data related to transactions of the buyer with a third party or some other parameter. In addition ratings may also be based on two or more macro type data factors from a group including but not limited to the country context of a party whether a party is registered with government authorities an assessment of a trading environment in a country macroeconomic information public recognition of a party number of shipments duration of experience size of transactions extent of international experience caliber of customers customer loyalty specialization in product categories specialization in manufacturing techniques specialization in materials specialization in gender feedback on language skills feedback on sample making ability respect for intellectual property quality management social responsibility environmental responsibility and the like.

The multi sourced data trend analysis may facilitate making investment decisions. In an example investors interested in trading the stock of a shipping company or market segment may utilize information derived from the trend analysis to help guide investment decisions. In the example shipping organizations involved in transportation of oil may benefit from an increase in global demand for oil. Trends derived from customs transaction records for oil importation may indicate or substantiate a suspected increase in revenues for companies transporting oil. Trends about movement of various products may point at increased business businesses opportunity in these products. Trends analysis about the movement of products and commodities may aid in forecasting price movements and demand of these products and services which may reflect on the potential value of the entities participating in the supply of these products or services.

The platform may include a free text extraction tool that may identify relevant portions of textual data such as press releases. The relevant text may correspond to a particular product or organization. In an example textual data may be extracted and then the extracted data may be applied in an analysis of the customs transaction and other data to identify trends corresponding to a particular product or organization.

The platform may facilitate bringing together trends of an organization across various categories. For example the trends of an organization relative to the world relative to a region relative to a segment and the like may be combined for conveniently analyzing the trends of a particular organization. These trends may facilitate decipher the performance of products of an organization in a specified region. Likewise trends may facilitate identification of regions of increasing or declining demand. The product demand may be ascertained from the shipping area and international trade data sources.

Further the trends in a particular region obtained for a product may have significance to currencies of countries in that region. Positive or negative growth trends of the product may depend upon currency of a country. For example a product with small volumes shipping into a country may not be influenced by the currency fluctuation significantly but large trade volume associated with that product may be significantly impacted based on the valuation of currency of that country. Likewise import data of products may be influenced with the currency of a country. For example data related to a product may be combined with historical currency prices of a country for finding positive impact of the import on the current valuation of currency or negative growth trends of the product. In addition the data related to the product may be combined with public forecasts of finance ministers about a country s exports may be useful in predicting trends of trading in that country.

Because trade transaction records e.g. customs records allow for entities to remain anonymous so that there is no identifying information for an entity participating in a customs transaction it may be necessary to separate out organizations that may have decided to opt out from having their names included in customs records. To this aspect the platform may detect the presence of opt out entities and may provide analysis related to the same. For example the rating of a supplier who ships to opt out buyers may be adjusted based on the ratio of opt out buyers to opt in buyers. Analysis of entities that do business with opt out organizations may be compensated by analyzing just the non opt out records and excluding the opt out records from the analysis or rating. In another implementation opt out data may be compensated by interpolating the available data for these opt out organizations. Even when entities opt out of customs records other information such as product codes may be sufficient to identify other buyers or shippers who also buy or sell similar products. In this way the platform may provide analysis of a entity s competitors even when the competitors have opted out in customs transaction records.

The platform may detect the presence of a new entity in a market place even when the entity or an entity that the new entity is doing business is an opt out entity. If an opt out entity has been receiving products from one supplier and new customs records indicate that the one supplier is now delivering fewer products while a new supplier is delivering the balance of the products it may be possible to detect that the opt out company has introduced a new supplier. Based on any industry affiliation or based on product references in the customs records other buyers of similar products may be notified of the new supplier. Similarly when a known buyer starts receiving products from a supplier that they have not previously used even if the supplier is an opt out entity it is possible for the platform to detect the supplier change addition and may provide relevant information or alerts to competitors of the known buyer.

In another scenario the platform may use data related to a supply chain for assessing sustainability of an organization in a market. The supply chain related data may include data related to the goods shipped by the organizations distances traveled for shipment source of shipments and the like. Supply chain data may be used to establish an environmental protection or greenness rating of organizations. Organizations with high cost transportation in their supply chain may be rated low on greenness due to the amount of carbon output required in the supply chain. Furthermore the greenness assessments may facilitate establishing a new greenness index for organizations.

The analysis of entities described herein including various risk ratings and the like may be beneficial in securities trading activities. Securities trading may be based on assessments and predictions of future business value and the ratings and assessments described herein may contribute to an estimate of future business valuations. Traders may look to the ratings of individual entities when considering how to trade the securities of the individual entities. Fund managers may look to the ratings of industries regions and the like to make decisions about which equities to add or remove when adjusting the fund s allocation of assets. By knowing an estimate of risks associated with an entity a securities trader may adjust a hedging strategy accordingly. Trends associated with products that may be provided by the platform may factor into a derivatives securities trading plan. Indexed equities may be traded based on an assessment of risk profile of the key entities represented by the index. When analyzing a transaction such as a merger or acquisition the risk profile of the potential acquisition target may be valuable to an acquiring entity to determine valuation of the target. By providing comparisons of entities the platform may facilitate recommending transactions such as recommending companies to acquire . The ratings trends macro level assessment predictions and the like that are possible with the platform may benefit analysis of all types of trading strategies including buy hold sell decisions risk allocation pooling hedging credit default swaps portfolio insurance asset allocation program trading thresholds limits and the like. Because the ratings trends and other assessment may be executed at all levels of business e.g. division company sector geography index macro level and the like investment decisions that relate to any of these levels e.g. sector financial analysis may benefit from the use of the platform.

The methods and systems described herein may include using a computer implemented facility to provide a marketplace system for accessing information and resources of suppliers and buyers. The marketplace system may contain one or more supplier or buyer profiles associated with a supplier or a buyer. A user may engage the marketplace system to locate a buyer or supplier whose profile satisfies a certain criteria.

A supplier or buyer profile may initially contain basic public information. The basic public information may be of the type generally available about the supplier or the buyer such as company name address phone number website address and the like. A supplier or a buyer may claim or take ownership of its profile within the marketplace. The marketplace system may provide a method for a supplier or a buyer to create an account within the system which would identify the supplier s or buyer s profile. A registration fee may be associated with registering or claiming a profile. A supplier or a buyer may be offered options for supplementing its claimed profile with additional information. As an example and not a limitation the additional information may be of the type collected by the marketplace system from customs data shipper data and other publicly or privately available data sources. As another example the additional information may be generated by the supplier or the buyer and uploaded to the system.

A supplier or a buyer may be presented with a plurality of options relating to managing and administering data associated with their profiles in the marketplace. A supplier or a buyer may pay a fee and take control of a profile and the information provided opt out of the marketplace system by removing the profile leave the profile as generated by the marketplace system pay a fee to have the marketplace facilitators manage the profile select certain types of data to be allowed to be associated with the profile combinations thereof and the like. Further in the embodiment suppliers or buyers may be presented with one or more privacy options. These privacy options may allow them to decide how certain information is shared through the marketplace system. A supplier or a buyer may decide to allow access to public information about the company once it is validated or approved by them. They may alternatively allow certain private data to be made available to subscribers of the marketplace. The information may be available for a fee to be paid by the user accessing the data. A condition of making this information available may require that a portion of that fee being shared with the supplier or the buyer. To encourage suppliers or buyers to actively manage or subscribe to profile management services the marketplace may include a disclosure rating system associated with the amount and type of information a supplier or a buyer chooses to disclose. Such a disclosure rating may be used to rank the supplier or the buyer among its peers.

To establish and maintain high quality profile data the marketplace system may provide a verification facility. The verification facility may use a plurality of records of transactions among a plurality of buyers and a plurality of suppliers to verify information that a supplier or a buyer provides to be associated with its profile. As an example and not a limitation the marketplace system verification facility could help a user to verify a supplier s claims about manufacturing throughput by comparing them with shipping quantities for similar items. The marketplace may require a fee from a supplier to display an indication that its profile has been verified by the marketplace. Similarly a buyer using the marketplace may be charged a fee for accessing the verification facility or for obtaining the verified status of a supplier.

To further enhance marketplace data quality the verification facility may perform an accuracy check of a profile for accuracy using publicly and privately available information. The accuracy check may be performed automatically and in real time and a profile may be updated immediately to reflect validated changes such as changes associated with shipping delays price fluctuations and the like. Such real time features of the marketplace data quality system may enable other marketplace aspects such as bidding systems and trading systems that rely on accurate and timely data.

The marketplace system may also include a self disclosure integrity scale or rating. A self disclosure integrity scale may compare the information provided by the supplier or buyer associated with their profile information with previously recorded shipper information about them. As an example and not a limitation a supplier claiming shipping times of less than a week for its products that is not supported by transaction history extracted from shipper information would receive a low self disclosure integrity scale rating. Another example may be cited wherein a buyer s transaction history extracted from shipper information may be used to verify a buyer s ability to perform in a transaction. A buyer rating system may be provided based on timely payment for shipments rate of returns quantity of shipments types of products shipped and the like.

Further in the embodiment a formula may be used to reward accuracy by allowing higher visibility for suppliers and buyers with a higher self disclosure integrity scale rating. Since higher visibility may potentially lead to more business a supplier or buyer may thus be encouraged to maintain high self disclosure integrity in its profile.

The marketplace system may also provide a facility for a reliability or performance rating. The reliability or performance rating may be based on transaction history extracted from shipper information. As an example and not a limitation a supplier with a history of timely shipment may receive a high reliability rating. A formula may be used to reward reliability and performance by allowing higher visibility for suppliers or buyers with a higher reliability or performance rating.

In addition to providing data services the marketplace system may provide a prospecting facility. The prospecting facility may utilize shipper information to predict delays and disruptions in future transactions. As an example and not a limitation a delayed shipment of parts to a manufacturer may result in that manufacturer being unable to ship its product in a timely fashion. The prospecting facility may recognize the delayed parts shipment and alert the supplier s customers of the upcoming delay. As another example the prospecting facility may alert the manufacturer of the impending delay and present options for purchasing parts from other parts suppliers who are capable of delivering replacement parts within a needed timeframe. The prospecting facility may use a shipper s internal information such as increased hiring patterns in certain areas at certain times to predict shipping delays before they occur. The marketplace system may then rate suppliers based on their proximity to a potential shipping disturbance and provide a buyer with a list of suppliers less likely to be affected by it.

In addition to information services and prospecting services the marketplace system may provide a bidding facility. A plurality of buyers may bid for the services of a supplier likewise a plurality of suppliers may bid to fulfill a buyer s order. The bidding facility may contain an order posting system where a buyer would post information relevant to an order such as item type specification quantity price and required delivery date. A buyer s rating may be used to prioritize its order in the order posting system. A plurality of supplier may then bid to fulfill the order. The bidding facility may present the bids to a buyer with the supplier s identifying information obscured but with its honesty reliability and performance rating provided. Such a presentation may allow more price competition among suppliers of varying size and having differing name recognition.

A supplier may use the bidding facility to provide information about its ability to deliver a particular item type of item or the like. The supplier may provide an item specification or description an available quantity location speed with which it can be shipped price and the like. A plurality of buyers may bid to purchase from the supplier. The bidding facility may provide the bids to the supplier with the buyer s identifying information obscured but with its honesty reliability and performance rating provided.

To facilitate enhanced use of the marketplace for suppliers buyers service providers and the like the marketplace system may provide an advertising facility. A plurality of suppliers and or buyers may be listed according to various aspects such as self disclosure integrity reliability performance rating and other aspects of rating as described herein. Through the advertising facility a supplier e.g. with a low rating may pay a fee to have a sponsored listing appear alongside higher ranked competitors. The marketplace system may normally exclude suppliers from certain types of searches e.g. searches that are fee to a buyer unless the supplier opts in to be included in such searches by paying a fee if and when a search is performed that results in the supplier being listed. Generally a supplier may optionally pay a fee to have its preferred or branded information displayed when it is included in the results of a search. Advertising in the marketplace system and elsewhere may be enhanced through the use of private data e.g. shipper information by allowing an advertiser to supplement traditional advertising techniques based on shipment information. As an example and not a limitation when a shipment to a buyer is delayed and the buyer is looking at similar items within the marketplace system a plurality of supplier may be notified that the buyer may need replacement goods e.g. the buyer may post the need on the marketplace and the suppliers may respond to that post . A supplier may then present a special offer to the buyer for a purchase of items that would replace the delayed shipment. The special offer may be presented in real time such as through a banner advertisement or a targeted search result and the like.

In addition to allowing a supplier to manage and augment information that may be associated with a supplier profile a supplier may further augment how its profile is used in the marketplace e.g. to make itself more appealing to a buyer . The marketplace system may assess a charge per click fee every time the supplier s profile is clicked by a buyer or every time a buyer makes a purchase after clicking the profile and the like.

The methods and systems described herein may include identification of potential customers within an organization based on a specific criterion. Individuals within a corporation that is a buyer supplier shipper service provider third party or otherwise identifiable in the records of the systems may be targeted to facilitate offering volume discounts promotional codes recruiting offers targeted offers and the like. In an example of a individual targeting within marketplace system as described herein by recruiting more individuals from within an organization that is already a member of the marketplace system the volume of transactions placed through the marketplace for existing customers may be increased thereby increasing the marketplace s relevance revenue profitability visibility and the like.

To facilitate reaching out to additional contacts within known companies an existing user s business name may be used to search for potential additional contacts within that user s business. Alternatively information about individuals e.g. contact information addresses names and the like that may be included in the public customs private or semi private data may be harvested to facilitate contacting such individuals to promote the features and benefits of the methods and systems described herein.

In addition information derived from an on line interaction with a user such as the user s IP address browser related information and the like that may facilitate identifying an aspect of the user may be used to offer up to the browser through which the user is conducting the on line interaction content that is targeted to the user such as a customized landing web page offers and the like. The information derived from the on line interaction may be compared to other available information such as public customs records private and semi private data e.g. shipper data and the like to look for indications that the derived information is associated with one or more records associated with the public private or semi private data. There are several techniques described herein for determining information about parties of a transaction from public transaction records e.g. customs data . The information determined about parties from the public private and or semiprivate data may be used to help identify aspects of the user conducting the on line interaction. Information that may be provided by subscribers to the on line platform described herein may also be used to help align information about entities e.g. buyers sellers shippers logistics providers and the like captured in the public private and semi private records with on line interaction information that may be used to identify aspects of a user. Subscribers may provide email addresses physical addresses company names phone numbers IP addresses and the like actively or passively that may be used directly or in combination with information determined about parties from the captured transaction records to help identify an aspect of a user in an on line interaction.

When an aspect of the user in an on line interaction is determined to be associated with a known entity as described herein the platform may facilitate targeting content to the user. In an example if an email address provided by a user engaged in an on line interaction with the platform can be determined to be associated with a buyer entity that is known to the platform e.g. from public customs transaction records then the user may be presented with a web page that includes artifacts associated with the known buyer entity. In the example if the on line user s email address is john smith panjiva.com and the transaction records or other records accessible to the platform indicate that Panjiva is a buyer entity that purchases widgets then the user who has identified himself as john smith panjiva.com may be presented with a web page that includes widget specific content. The content may include suppliers of widgets other buyers of widgets in the area widget transaction summaries advertisements for widget repair service widget inventory service widget marketing service and the like. Similarly because John smith panjiva.com has been identified as a new on line user of the platform and there are other users from the buyer Panjiva already registered with the platform john smith panjiva.com may be presented with an offer that is consistent with new members of an existing subscriber buyer entity.

In another example a user s web browser may transmit an IP address in standard electronic communication between a browser and a server that is hosting the on line platform as described herein. The IP address may be analyzed and it may be determined that the computer that the user is using in the on line interaction is within the range of IP addresses that have been determined to belong to buyer entity Panjiva. In this way without the user taking any action to identify himself or his place of business the platform may detect a relationship between the user s IP address and the Panjiva buyer entity. In these examples an association is made between an on line user and a buyer entity. There are other examples that may allow determination of an aspect of an on line user based on information derived from the on line interaction and information provided by other users of the platform even if those users are not associated with an entity for which transaction records exist.

The methods and systems described herein may include use of shipment and customs declaration data that comes from a private or semi private source on an aggregated basis to protect privacy confidentiality of parties while providing information about suppliers and information about buyers. Aggregating data within and across a plurality of data sources including public sources such as customs declaration data and private sources such as shipper or logistics provider data may facilitate and or improve providing information about suppliers and buyers while enabling substantial protection of privacy and or confidentiality of parties by removing information that may be used to identify a particular party or parties in transactions. Private sources of data such as shipper data may include private and confidential information about clients and customers of the shipper that may be removed masked or encrypted to prevent the data from being used to identify third parties. Alternatively aggregating non private and non confidential data based on various aspects such as dates quantities jurisdictions schedules e.g. next day before 10 AM delivery next day delivery two day three day standard Saturday delivery same day courier choice of conveyance e.g. air land sea charges e.g. per shipment per item payment terms on account e.g. credit account debit account prepay COD post bill and the like and many other dimensions of aggregation may facilitate providing information and analysis about any of these dimensions and or combinations thereof using the methods and systems described herein and elsewhere.

Aggregation across public and private data may facilitate supplementing the public data with logistics and delivery related information that can substantially enhance the public data. In an example customs data may identify a supplier customs agent or facilitator buyer or recipient of a customs controlled shipment and various details about the customs controlled shipment. Supplementing this with private or semi private data e.g. details from a logistics provider handling the shipment for the supplier may enable detailed analysis about costs timing schedule changes and the like. The supplemental data may indicate that a shipment passed through customs with no unexpected delays yet the buyer refused to accept the shipment because an incoming inspection process caused the lot to be rejected. Without this supplemental data it may be difficult to determine this aspect of supplier quality from public records alone.

Private or semi private data may also be used to facilitate validating public data. Public data may include various entry errors and lack of information that while not necessarily causing significant problems in a customs transaction may cause challenges to validating the information and properly determining details about the transaction e.g. a supplier may be identified on a customs declaration as the logistics provider for the source supplier . By combining private or semi private data e.g. shipper data an original source supplier associated with the customs declaration may be determined. Such obfuscation may be intentional or unintentional however without the private data the original source supplier may not be known. Further details may be helpfully determined from private or semi private aggregated data as well. In an example a customs declaration may identify the general type of material or a count of containers being shipped and a customs value yet the actual number of items may be missing. Private data may enhance these values by providing details about the destination i.e. recipient and the like.

Likewise public data may help to validate aggregated private data. IF private data is aggregated to remove details about individual shipments customs data which includes details about individual shipments may be used to validate the private data. Customs data may cover a large number of shippers whereas private data may be limited to one or a few shippers. By combining private and public data sources the aggregated private data can be vetted against the public data to ensure that the private data is not in conflict with the public data. If such conflict is found techniques for resolving the conflict may be employed including audits and the like. Improperly aggregated private data may be invalidated by comparing it to public records such as customs records.

Private or semi private data may be aggregated separately from customs data to provide unique views of activity and trends at a regional level. Such aggregated data may be used to identify shipment related activity for a country state county city port geographic region preferred shipping route carrier and the like. Aggregated data may also be useful for identifying trends related to shipments or patterns of shipments for such regions and the like. Private data may include historical data that may be used to facilitate providing a prediction or projection of region based shipping in the near term and longer term time frames. In an example historical data may include shipments from a region in light of macro economic data. As new macro economic data and or new regional shipping data is aggregated upcoming shipment activity for a region may be predicted based on the new data. If the new data indicates an improvement in macro economics then shipments for the region may be predicted to increase.

Macro economic data may also be used with private public and semi private data to help identify relationships between these data sources that may help identify potential impact on multiple suppliers that operate in a region. If macro economic data support private shipper data that indicates a decrease in activity for a region then one can predict that suppliers shippers logistics providers carriers and the like that operate in that region may be similarly affected negatively. This information may be helpful in determining opportunities for buyers and suppliers such as lower prices availability of shipping resources production capability availability and the like. These and many other types of region based assessments may be done based on aggregated private data.

The methods and systems described herein may include various methods of handling shipment related data such as data ingestion filtering normalization de duplication data quality and the like. Here we discuss some of these techniques and approaches for handling shipment related data from private and semi private sources.

Normalization of data may facilitate marrying private shipping data with public shipping data e.g. customs declaration and execution records and the like . Normalization may include normalizing data within a private data set e.g. across the various data sources handled by a shipper or logistics provider . Normalization within and among the various private and public data sets may include addressing differences in formats fields codes and the like. Logistics and or shipper data may be somewhat more consistent than public data and or data from various sources. However independent of the consistency of a data source it may be possible to establish a normalization profile for a private data source or to establish normalization profiles for various portions of a private data source. These profiles may facilitate use of the private data with the public data.

It is generally expected that conflicts among data from multiple data sources will need to be addressed. Conflict rules may be established e.g. based on a normalization profile customer preference historic quality determination of a data source and the like that allow the conflicts to be resolved. Conflicts may be resolved in favor of private data public data or may be based on a triangulation across the two or more data sets. Such techniques may provide important benefits to quickly and accurately resolving conflicts. In addition early detection and determination of a proper conflict resolution approach for a given instance of a dataset may substantially improve response time in real time based data assessment methods that may provide a user with dynamic ad hoc assessment of the data sets.

Conflict rules may be based on granularity. Customs or public data may be more granular than aggregated private shipping records. A description in a private shipper record may be clothing while custom data may describe the composition of the clothing e.g. 60 Merino wool 30 cotton 10 rayon and the like including colors styles etc. Such richness in the data may be valuable for a variety of businesses. Data sets can be assessed based on a dimension of richness as well. Richer datasets generally may be taken from public data sources e.g. customs declaration data than from private data sources which may not need such details to properly complete a shipping activity. This may in part be based on the need for the strict legal enforcement of cross border transfers that public data must support and private data does not require.

Triangulation may be performed for any variety of data elements yet numeric values e.g. weight and value lends itself towards triangulation. Because a declared value for customs impacts an import tax or duty that may have to be paid by the importer these may generally be considered to be below the actual market or wholesale value of the contents being imported. Whereas value that is identified to a private carrier e.g. for insurance purposes may provide a more accurate or at least a value that is equal to or greater than the cost of replacing the contents. Such numbers may be triangulated to identify a more likely value. In this way private data may be more reliable. Weight is a similar dimension that may be suitable for triangulation. Weights may be estimated for customs purposes whereas shippers base transportation costs e.g. fuel on actual weight. Therefore private data e.g. shipper data may be more accurate and or reliable.

Private data particularly destination data may be particularly well vetted because a shipper or other logistics provider who is responsible for proper delivery and billing will most assuredly have accurate addresses for shipment destinations. Therefore private data that is reliable and accurate for destinations may be used to enhance the public data relating to buyers because for example destination addresses may be linkable to a particular buyer through the private data billing information and the like. Private data may facilitate overcoming limitations of detecting valid data from handwritten forms filled out by non native language users and the like.

The methods and systems described herein may utilize private data such as shipper s data to analyze trends in shipping for a particular supplier buyer etc. The shipper s data may provide details such as the buyer and the supplier locations and any specific changes in the transactions between these locations. For example from shipper s data it may be possible to track an increase in supply of electronic components from a supplier. This might be useful to understand the growth of the supplier and its market reach. Accordingly the supplier might be offered details of buyers in the area where the supplier is already supplying. Similarly indications of business trends such as rapid growth may be used to automatically predict needs based on a detected trend and the methods and systems described herein may automatically attempt to fulfill those predicted needs. In an example of attempting to fulfill predicted needs based on business trend indications if it is determined that a particular supplier has increased its manufacturing capacity threefold in the last three months e.g. the private shipper data may include a new pricing structure for substantially increased shipments that are expected from the supplier then it may be predicted that the supplier may welcome some potential buyers to order products based on the additional capacity. Likewise buyers of the products that are similar to those that may be provided by the increased capacity may be notified of the potential increased availability of products.

Private data such as shipping records may be rich sources of data for providing analysis about companies regions marketplaces pricing and the like. Natural language processing may be useful in extracting relevant terms from a set of shipping records that may facilitate capturing the rich data values. In an example natural language processing may be used to determine which products a company receives most frequently. That information may be represented as a tag cloud which may be further analyzed to identify information e.g. shipments that are trending positive and those that are trending negative. Such analysis may help with identifying areas of growth and new business opportunities that may extend beyond the individual buyers and or shipper data. Existing and new supplier profiles may be enhanced by using the information gathered with natural language processing from a set of shipping records e.g. private shipper records and the trend information derived there from e.g. analyzing the tag clouds . In addition to any public data records e.g. customs transaction records that may exist on a supplier the private shipper records may facilitate capturing domestic shipping transactions transactions that appear in public records as occurring between third parties and the like and associate them with a supplier thereby improving supplier profiles ratings risk profiles and the like. Relevant terms that may be extracted using natural language processing may include products shipment dates fees payment terms consignees logistics partners and the like that may or may not be known from public transaction records. These additional terms derived from private or semi private shipper records may facilitate rating suppliers who do not have public transaction records e.g. domestic only suppliers suppliers who use a third party for all shipments recorded in public records and the like. The trending analysis of the terms found using natural language processing may enable adjusting a rating profile of a supplier. In an example if a supplier s payment to a private shipper is trending out longer time for the shipper to receive payment the supplier s financial risk rating may be increased. In another example if a supplier s public records of shipments into the U.S.A. indicate a substantial increase in shipments followed by a substantial reduction in shipments likely indicating a slowdown in business yet that same supplier s private shipper records show domestic U.S.A. shipments are remaining constant then one may conclude the supplier has built up a domestic inventory to satisfy domestic customers.

Consignee data from private semi private e.g. shipper or public e.g. customs data sources may be used to develop a heat map of markets e.g. for specific countries or regions . Such a heat map analysis and visualization may show the markets for a given supplier may show the countries regions states even neighborhoods that represent the markets for a supplier. Such a heat map may be used to determine which markets are served most frequently by a supplier. By determining information about suppliers such as markets most frequently served it may be possible to enhance a supplier profile to incorporate information related to those markets. In an example if a heat map for supplier Ikea indicates that a supplier most frequently serves a market which may be experiencing substantial political or economic change a profile of that supplier may be adjusted accordingly.

Normalization may also be useful in understanding a supplier s markets and better tune a market heat map. One aspect of normalization may be to use global market data to help normalize a supplier data. In an example if a supplier ships one half 50 of its shipments to Zimbabwe and industry data indicates that this is in comparison relatively much greater than other suppliers one can estimate a market analysis for the products being supplied by the supplier to Zimbabwe.

Private shipper and private consignee data may be useful for characterizing a supplier. These may include using consignee data and date of shipment data to develop a sense of which countries or regions are becoming a more prominent part of a supplier s customer base. Similarly using the number of shipments and other measures of shipment rates may be useful in characterizing a supplier as one of growing shrinking or remaining stable. By triangulating with other data e.g. credit data it may be further possible to identify characteristics of a supplier. If credit data indicates that the supplier is taking longer to pay then there may be a financial risk to buyers who prepay or make advance payments for custom orders. Machine learning is another technique that may be applied to shipment data that may help determine which components of the various data sources that provide data for a supplier are the most representative of leading indicators for the supplier e.g. an indication of or lack of company stability .

Consignee data may also be useful for trending analysis to determine which countries may be increasing export activity. Further analysis may help indicate which products and or markets within the region may be growing faster than others and which supplier may be benefiting most from the growth by comparing trends for various product categories being exported out of a region.

Supplier to consignee data may be useful in identifying key country to country relationships and groupings. By analyzing these simple data sources one can determine if a particular combination of countries e.g. China and Ireland may be growing or shrinking and why. By determining that product shipments of denim clothing from China to Southern Ireland is increasing one may be able to envision a change in denim marketplace occurring in Ireland.

Historical data and data over time may be useful in creating a model of capacity such as capacity over time or for a particular time frame e.g. seasonal capacity holiday capacity etc .

By connecting shipments over time into a supply chain wood from china is shipped to a factory and the factory ships furniture to a wholesaler in the U.S. who ships to retailers in Canada it may be possible to have a deep analysis of a supplier sources of raw materials that may help in ranking and risk assessment of the suppliers. This type of connection of supplier with suppliers with retailers with buyers may enable providing a directed graph of connections between all buyers and all suppliers. Such directed graph data may be useful in performing various analyses using any of a variety of graph analysis tools and algorithms. Analysis may include determining how connectivity changes over time in a region how deep a supply chain tends to be how deep a risk may propagate through a supply chain from a buyer and the like.

Supplier risk assessment may be enhanced with a metric that is related to a company s trajectory of imports exports payable and the like as well as the risks faced by the supplier s suppliers. Data regarding payables may be useful in such an analysis and risk assessment. Machine based learning may also be useful in this analysis.

Data related to shipments may include shipment weight. By comparing recent shipment weight data from a supplier for certain shipments to typical shipment weights from that supplier may be a leading indicator that the supplier is shipping sample lots or prototypes which may indicate that the supplier is active in product development.

By looking at value of goods based on insurance or declared value one may develop inferences about cost and pricing information for particular products mapping products e.g. description and quantity onto an ontology with the declared value for insurance purposes may facilitate generating a model which takes that into account with other companies similar statistics. The model may be established for how much a company sells a product for. Such a model could be done at the country company region level. This data which is provided by suppliers to protect the value of a shipment may be used to determine what buyers are paying for products. If the insurance value data for recurring shipments appears to be going up then one could determine that a buyer e.g. retailer GAP is likely being charged more for products by suppliers so earnings are going to be lower than expected this quarter. Although this example is for a particular buyer it could easily be applied at a macro level to product categories regions and the like.

Private and public shipment related data may be useful in identifying trends in trade flows. Trends may be determined for a given product. Product focused trends may include which countries are trending positive as exporters which are trending negative as exporters which countries are trending positive as importers which are trending negative as importers which trade routes a buyer country supplier country pair are trending positive and which are trending negative which destination ports are hot which departure ports are hot and which port trade lanes a departure port destination port pair are hot and other trends may be gleaned from shipment data.

Other data sources include satellite data of shipping routes to help determine which routes ships are actually traversing. By mapping the trade route data one may determine various trends and may visualize information about a product or shipment e.g. visualize timing of arrival and the like. Information such as lateness of shipment may be a top level metric that may be further analyzed to determine a source of shipment lateness. A shipment may be late due to lateness of transfer to the shipper indicating a supplier issue or may be due to lateness of delivery indicating a shipper issue . Such data may also help in analyzing sphere to sphere trade flows to help identify differences in various zones of the world. This may be useful in optimizing which ports a supplier or buyer should be targeting based on capacity cost proximity and the like.

The data extracted from shipping records may provide details such as preferences for particular shippers certain pricing patterns certain timing of shipments etc. Natural language processing of shippers data may be used to determine the products a buyer generally receives and the frequency of such deliveries. That information may be represented as a graph which may be analyzed to identify the general trends of requirements of a buyer. Such analysis may help with identifying areas of growth and new business opportunities. Existing and new buyer profiles may be enhanced by using the information gathered with natural language processing from a set of shipping records e.g. private shipper records and the trend information derived there from e.g. analyzing the tag clouds . In addition to any public data records e.g. customs transaction records that may exist on a buyer the private shipper records may facilitate capturing domestic shipping transactions transactions that appear in public records as occurring between third parties and the like and associate them with a buyer thereby improving buyer profiles ratings risk profiles and the like. Relevant terms that may be extracted using natural language processing may include products shipment dates fees payment terms consignees logistics partners and the like that may or may not be known from public transaction records. These additional terms derived from private or semi private shipper records may facilitate rating buyers who do not have public transaction records e.g. domestic only buyers buyers who use a third party for all shipments recorded in public records and the like. The trending analysis of the terms found using natural language processing may enable adjusting a rating profile of a buyer. In an example if a buyer s payment to a private shipper is trending out longer time for the shipper to receive payment the buyer s financial risk rating may be increased.

Consignee data may be used to develop a heat map of markets e.g. for specific countries or regions . Such a heat map analysis and visualization may show new markets for a buyer to buy show the countries regions states even neighborhoods which may provide products at shorter time period and required quantities may be ordered. Such a heat map may be used to determine which markets are accessed most frequently by a buyer. By determining information about buyers such as markets most frequently accessed it may be possible to enhance a buyer profile to incorporate information related to those markets. In an example if a heat map for buyer Panjiva indicates that Panjiva most frequently accesses a market which may be experiencing substantial political or economic change a profile of that buyer may be adjusted accordingly.

Normalization may also be useful in understanding the buying landscape to help buyers relate market analysis to a buyer s business plans. In an example if a buyer from Germany receives one half 50 of its electronic components shipments from suppliers in India and industry data indicates that this is in comparison relatively much greater than other German buyers the India sourced German market for electronic components may be estimated based on buyer data.

Consignee data may also be useful for trending analysis to determine which countries may be increasing import activity. Further analysis may help indicate which products and or markets within the region may be growing faster than others and which buyer s may be leading the growth by comparing trends for various product categories being imported into a region.

Shipper and consignee data may be also useful for characterizing a buyer. Buyer characterization may include using consignee data and date of shipment data to develop a sense of which countries or regions are becoming a more prominent part of a buyer s supply base. Similarly using the number of shipments and other measures of shipment rates may be useful in characterizing a buyer as one of growing shrinking or remaining stable. By triangulating with other data e.g. private shipper credit data it may be further possible to identify characteristics of a buyer. If credit data indicates that the buyer is taking longer to pay then there may be a financial risk to suppliers who extend credit to a buyer. Machine learning is another technique that may be applied to shipment data that may help determine which components of the various data sources that provide data for a buyer are the most representative of leading indicators for the buyer stability or lack thereof .

Historical data and data over time may be useful in creating a model of buyer demand such as demand over time or for a particular time frame e.g. seasonal demand holiday buyer demand etc .

By connecting shipments over time into a supply chain electronic component from India is shipped to a factory in Germany and the factory ships consumer electronic items to a wholesaler in the U.S. it may be possible to have a deep analysis of sources of raw materials that may help in ranking and risk assessment of the intermediate buyers in the supply chain. This type of connection of buyers who become suppliers to retailers may enable providing a directed graph of connections between all buyers all suppliers and any involved third party. Such directed graph data may be useful in performing various analyses using any of a variety of graph analysis tools and algorithms. Analysis may include determining how a buyer s connectivity in various supply chains changes over time in a region how deep a supply chain tends to extend from a particular buyer in the supply chain back to raw materials how deep a buyer s risk may propagate through a supply chain and the like.

Buyer risk assessment may be enhanced with a metric that is related to a company s trajectory of imports local receipts and the like as well as the risks faced by the buyer s buyers e.g. retailers . Data regarding payables may be useful in such an analysis and risk assessment.

In addition to using publicly available information such as customs data names and corporate structures directory services publicly traded company data the third party private or semi private information such as shipper information may also be utilized to facilitate identification and analyses of relationships between companies as they may exist in public records. This shipper information may show that two separate suppliers recorded in the public records may share an account with a shipper use the same billing address and the like.

With the enhancements potentially available using private or semi private data a relationship matrix of suppliers and buyers may be provided. As an example and not a limitation a relationship matrix may include a graphical representation of relationship proximity with the relative distance between suppliers in the graphical representation corresponding to the degree of closeness of corporate relationship. As an example of relationship validation two suppliers that appear separately in public data that share a common shipper account are highly likely to be closely related businesses. In this matrix view icons or other representations of suppliers and or buyers with relationships that may have been validated or appear to be more likely to be close based on private data may appear differently than the icons of suppliers and or buyers whose relationships have not been enhanced by private data.

In an embodiment the shipper data may be used to identify if two suppliers share a single user account and supply the same product to a single buyer. This may in turn reflect that the suppliers may have two different branches of a single company. Shipper data may also be used to identify any trends of transactions between various subsidiaries of a buyer and supplier and forecast deliveries.

In another embodiment the shipper s data may be analyzed to depict any name similarities and trading relationships to identify companies likely to have a corporate relationship.

Private data from shippers and logistics providers for example may include general forecasts of business based on shipping patterns that may include seasonal forecasts regional forecasts infrastructure changes adding removing infrastructure such as intermediate shipment points offices information about the carriers that shippers and or logistics providers use to move freight head count changes or plans credit a shipper or logistics provider may extend to a supplier or importer collections on owed amounts delivery pick up pushback data may be an indication of companies being bad a meeting deadlines and the like. Private and semi private data may also be useful in profiling shippers carriers logistics providers and the like.

The shipper s data may also be utilized to note the efficiency of a supplier. For example the extent to which delivery pick ups are pushed back may be noticed which indicates that the supplier has not been able to meet deadlines in the past. Further shipper data may also provide details regarding the duration of a delay at the supplier s end.

The shipper s data may also be used to note and analyze the logistics insurance on any given shipment which may in turn be utilized to approximate the value of the whole shipment. This data may also be utilized to forecast the value of shipments and also the revenue generated by the supplier.

The shipper s data may also be utilized to develop a profile of shippers themselves and to evaluate the price risk and reliability of a shipper.

Planned increases in shipper head count or infrastructure expansion in certain regions may be leading indicators that business transactions in the region are likely to grow in the general timeframe associated with the planned expansions. This may be important for other businesses considering opening or expanding operations or sales activity in the region because it may lend creditability to the expected improvement of business activity that requires shipping services. Likewise seasonal swings in shipper head count may be used to identify opportunities for customers of the shipper to receive additional services made possible by the increased head count. Services like local inventory management return services and the like may be made available at lower costs with improved regional service.

Shippers and logistics providers may also subcontract work out to freight carriers customs service providers courier services and the like. Private and semi private data such as shipper data may be used to facilitate rating these supply chain participants as well. A poorly rated freight carrier subcontractor may indicate that a risk of delayed shipments or problems with shipments that rely on that subcontractor may be greater than with others. This may impact a supplier risk if the supplier s shipments are generally handled by the poorly rated subcontractor. Such information may be useful to buyers and to the supplier s . It may be informative to a supplier who is considering opening or expanding operations in a region that is served by the subcontracting carrier.
