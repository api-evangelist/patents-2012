A browser generally refers to a computer program that when executed within a computing system can request retrieve and display electronic documents such as pages over a communication network. Typically the browser executes within or as part of a client computing system and retrieves information from a server computing system. Modern browsers can provide users with an interactive experience through which data e.g. pages can be accessed.

Conventional browsers typically maintain a historical record of the various pages that a user visits. This historical record is usually stored locally on the computing system executing the browser. In some cases the browser can be configured at the request of a user not to maintain such a historical record of visited Web sites.

One or more embodiments disclosed within this specification relate to browser technology and more particularly to activation of a private browsing mode within a browser.

An embodiment can include a method. The method can include receiving an electronic document within a browser and detecting an indicator associated with the electronic document using a processor wherein the indicator is correlated with a private browsing mode of the browser. Responsive to detecting the indicator the electronic document can be rendered within a view of the browser in which private browsing mode is activated.

Another embodiment can include a method. The method can include determining whether a link displayed within an electronic document is associated with an indicator correlated with a private browsing mode of a browser. Responsive to determining that the link is associated with the indicator using a processor visually distinguishing the link from another link that is not associated with the indicator within the electronic document as rendered within a view by the browser.

Another embodiment can include a system having a processor. The processor can be configured to initiate executable operations including receiving an electronic document within a browser and detecting an indicator associated with the electronic document wherein the indicator is correlated with a private browsing mode of the browser. Responsive to detecting the indicator the electronic document can be rendered within a view of the browser in which private browsing mode is activated.

Another embodiment can include a computer program product. The computer program product can include a computer readable storage medium having stored thereon program code that when executed configures a processor to perform operations including receiving an electronic document within a browser and detecting an indicator associated with the electronic document wherein the indicator is correlated with a private browsing mode of the browser. Responsive to detecting the indicator the electronic document can be rendered within a view of the browser in which private browsing mode is activated.

While the specification concludes with claims defining features of one or more embodiments that are regarded as novel it is believed that the embodiment s will be better understood from a consideration of the description in conjunction with the drawings. As required one or more detailed embodiments are disclosed within this specification. It should be appreciated however that the embodiment s are merely exemplary. Therefore specific structural and functional details disclosed within this specification are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the embodiment s in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Further the terms and phrases used within this specification are not intended to be limiting but rather to provide an understandable description of the embodiments disclosed herein.

One or more embodiments disclosed within this specification relate to browser technology and more particularly to activation of a private browsing mode within a browser. In accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed within this specification one or more mechanisms for activating a private browsing mode within a browser can be exposed to developers. The private browsing mode can be activated within the browser responsive to one or more conditions that can be detected within various objects typically processed by the browser. As such private browsing mode can be activated at least in some cases automatically without user intervention. For example the user of the browser need not explicitly request activation of the private browsing mode.

Private browsing mode refers to a mode of operation of a browser. In general private browsing mode is activated for a particular view of a browser. As used within this specification the term view refers to a region displayed as part of a user interface e.g. a graphical user interface of a computer program such as a browser within which an electronic document is rendered. A view for example can be implemented as a tab of a browser or a window of a browser. As such private browsing mode can be activated on a per view basis.

While private browsing mode is activated for a particular view of the browser the browser does not perform one or more functions that would otherwise be performed were the browser operating in normal browsing mode e.g. with private browsing mode deactivated. For instance in normal browsing mode a browser typically maintains a historical record stored within the computing system executing the browser of one or more user activities conducted within a particular view of the browser or conducted in any view in which private browsing mode is deactivated.

Examples of the types of user activities for which a browser maintains a historical record in normal browsing mode can include but are not limited to electronic documents that are retrieved searches that are performed and files that are downloaded. By comparison the browser does not maintain a historical record of electronic documents that are retrieved of searches that are performed or of files that are downloaded via any view of the browser in which private browsing mode is activated.

Another part of the historical record maintained while in normal browsing mode can include files such as cookies that are received by the browser. The files are persisted after the browser session ends e.g. after the browser stops execution or a particular view of the browser is closed. By comparison files such as cookies can be deleted responsive to a user input requesting termination of browser execution e.g. exiting or closing the browser or the termination of a view in which private browsing mode is activated e.g. exiting or closing a view .

Another part of the historical record maintained while in normal browsing mode can include bookmarks that are created or changes to personal settings. Any bookmarks created through a view in which private browsing mode is activated can be deleted responsive to a user input requesting termination of browser execution or termination of the view in which private browsing mode is activated. Similarly changes to settings that are made in a view of the browser while in private browsing mode can be undone or placed into the state that existed prior to activation of private browsing mode responsive to the various conditions described above.

The exemplary user activities described are provided for purposes of illustration only. As such the examples are not intended to be limiting of the embodiments disclosed within this specification or of the historical record that can be maintained by a browser. Activation of private browsing mode can include the disablement of one or more or all of the operations described relating to maintaining a historical record and or disablement of other operations e.g. user activity tracking operations that would otherwise be performed in normal browsing mode.

System being a data processing system can execute suitable program code e.g. an operating system not shown and a browser . Browser can be implemented as a computer program that when executed configures system to perform operations including but not limited to requesting data from server retrieving data from server and displaying data received from server . In general system can be configured as a client computing system communicatively linked with server via network .

Network can represent any of a variety of communication networks or a combination of two or more communication networks. For example network can be implemented as or include a Wide Area Network a local area network a wireless network a mobile network the Internet or various combinations thereof.

Server can be implemented as a data processing system or as a group of two or more interconnected data processing systems that store information. Server can be configured to provide data stored therein to one or more other systems e.g. system responsive to a request for information from the system.

In operation system while executing browser can send a request to server via network . Request can specify one or more electronic documents to be retrieved from server whether directly specified in the form of a requested Universal Resource Identifier URI indirectly specified in the form of a search query or the like. Responsive to request server can send a response in the form of an electronic document to system via network .

An electronic document refers to a file or files that can be rendered within a browser. One example of electronic document can include but is not limited to a page e.g. a Web Page. Other examples of electronic documents can include but are not limited to word processing documents spreadsheet documents images video audio or any other content that can be accessed over network . Typically electronic document is accessed by browser using a URI. In any case electronic document can be associated with a private browsing mode PBM indicator as illustrated in . PBM indicator is correlated with a private browsing mode of browser .

PBM indicator can be an identifier that is associated with electronic document . In one aspect PBM indicator can be located or included within electronic document . In another aspect PBM indicator can be formed of one or more portions of the URI for electronic document . In another aspect PBM indicator can be an attribute associated with electronic document such as a link attribute for a hyperlink referencing electronic document . In any case responsive to browser identifying PBM indicator in association with electronic document browser can open electronic document in a view in which private browsing mode is activated.

Memory elements can include one or more physical memory devices such as for example local memory and one or more bulk storage devices . Local memory refers to random access memory RAM or other non persistent memory device s generally used during actual execution of the program code. Bulk storage device s can be implemented as a hard disk drive HDD a solid state drive SSD or another persistent data storage device. System also can include one or more cache memories not shown that provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times program code must be retrieved from bulk storage device during execution.

Input output I O devices such as a keyboard a display and a pointing device optionally can be coupled to system . The I O devices can be coupled to system either directly or through intervening I O controllers. One or more network adapters also can be coupled to system to enable system to become coupled to other systems computer systems remote printers and or remote storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems cable modems and Ethernet cards are examples of different types of network adapters that can be used with system .

As pictured in memory elements can store browser . Browser being implemented in the form of executable program code can be executed by system and as such can be considered part of system . In general browser can be configured to detect and or identify a PBM indicator within data received from a server. In response to detecting the PBM indicator browser can activate private browsing mode available within browser for rendering the data or other data not yet received within a view presented upon display . The term render within this specification can refer to executing an electronic document interpreting an electronic document e.g. interpreting markup language or a script displaying an electronic document or playing an electronic document such as audio and or video.

In one aspect browser can include the functionality described within this specification for detecting PBM indicator as part of the native infrastructure or architecture of browser . In another aspect browser can include a PBM application programming interface API that can be accessed by developers of electronic documents that can be rendered by browser .

For example PBM API can be made available to and accessed by an extension not shown that is installed within browser . PBM API can provide one or more functions that can be accessed or invoked by the extension in order to activate private browsing mode for retrieved electronic documents as described in further detail within this specification.

In block the system can send a request for an electronic document to a server. In one aspect the request can be sent in consequence of a received user input requesting an electronic document such as the selection of a hyperlink referencing the electronic document. For example the request for the electronic document can originate from a currently open or active view of the browser in which the hyperlink is selected. In another aspect the request can be sent in consequence of an automated feature of the browser in which one or more electronic documents are retrieved by the system. In block the system can receive the electronic document specified by the request in block .

In block the system can determine whether the electronic document includes a PBM indicator. In one aspect the system can parse e.g. search the electronic document to determine whether the electronic document includes a PBM indicator. In illustration the electronic document can include markup language such as HyperText Markup Language HTML or the like. The system can detect an attribute or tag within the electronic document indicating that the electronic document is to be opened in a view of the browser in which private browsing mode is activated. For example the PBM indicator can be an HTML attribute or tag located in the header portion of the electronic document.

In another aspect the PBM indicator can be specified as or included within e.g. be part of the URI of the electronic document. The browser can be configured to detect electronic documents having a URI that matches predetermined criteria correlated with private browsing mode.

In one aspect an extension can be installed within the browser that is configured to open particular electronic documents using private browsing mode. The extension can be configured to maintain a list of items e.g. private browsing mode criteria such as URIs or patterns within URIs e.g. portions of URIs. An electronic document having a URI or any portion of a URI such as a hierarchical part or a query part that matches the private browsing mode criteria e.g. an item on the list can be considered by the extension to include a PBM indicator. For example the URI can be evaluated when the request is sent by the browser.

Responsive to determining that the electronic document does not include a PBM indicator method can continue to block . In block the system can render the electronic document using normal browsing mode. The electronic document can be rendered in a new view or in the current view of the browser.

Responsive to determining that the electronic document does include a PBM indicator method can continue to block . In block the system can determine whether private browsing mode is already activated in the current view of the browser. Responsive to determining that private browsing mode is already activated in the current view of the browser method can proceed to block . In block the system can render the electronic document in the current view. Responsive to determining that private browsing mode is not activated in the current view of the browser method can continue to block .

In block the system can create e.g. open a new view for the browser. In block the system can activate private browsing mode for the new view. It should be appreciated that while blocks and are illustrated as being separate blocks activation of private browsing mode can be performed concurrently with the creation of the new view. In any case in block the electronic document can be rendered within the new view. Blocks can be performed automatically by the system without user intervention.

In another aspect the system can be configured to delete historical data for the electronic document. As discussed while in normal browsing mode a historical record of user activities is routinely stored. Accordingly in one aspect any data relating to the retrieval of the electronic document of block can be deleted from the system. Responsive to activation of private browsing mode e.g. immediately responsive to activation of private browsing mode or at a time thereafter such as responsive to closing the view in which the electronic document is rendered in block the system can delete any record of the request issued in block and or the receipt of the electronic document in block . Any other historical data relating to the electronic document also can be deleted.

Once private browsing mode is activated historical data is not persisted. The deletion process described facilitates the purging of data that can be collected for an electronic document while the system still is in normal browsing mode prior to activation of private browsing mode. For example in order to determine whether the electronic document includes a PBM indicator the electronic document still may be processed and in some cases rendered within a view of the browser. In the example illustrated in data collected as part of the historical record for the electronic document while in normal browsing mode can be deleted if the electronic document is opened in private browsing mode. Further any view of the browser in which private browsing mode is deactivated and the electronic document may have been displayed prior to the creation of the new view as described with reference to block can be closed.

In the example illustrated in browser has received electronic document and detected PBM indicator associated with electronic document . In response to processing electronic document browser has created Tab and rendered electronic document within Tab . As shown Tab is the active tab. Further private browsing mode is activated for Tab as indicated by the PBM acronym in parenthesis in Tab .

In the example illustrated in browser has received electronic document and detected PBM indicator associated with electronic document . In response to processing electronic document browser has created window and rendered electronic document within window . As shown private browsing mode is activated for window as indicated by the PBM acronym in the title portion of window .

Accordingly method can begin in block where the system can render the electronic document in the current view of the browser. In block the system can display a control facilitating activation of private browsing mode responsive to detecting the PBM indicator associated with the electronic document. The control can be presented as any of a variety of visual elements commonly used within electronic documents such as a hyperlink a button a radio button or the like.

In one example the system can insert program code e.g. markup language or the like into the electronic document after retrieval that when rendered by the system causes the control to be displayed as part of the electronic document. In another example the system can present the control e.g. a button within an information bar across a portion of the viewable area of the current view in which the electronic document is rendered. The control can be presented using any of a variety of different interface techniques known to those skilled in the art. The examples presented are for purposes of illustration and as such are not intended as limitations of the embodiments disclosed within this specification.

In block the system can determine whether the control has been selected or activated via a user input. Responsive to determining that the control has not been activated method can continue to block where the electronic document can continue to be rendered in the current view of the browser in normal browsing mode. As illustrated method can continue to loop back to block to detect when or if a user input is received that activates the control.

Responsive to determining that the control has been activated method can proceed to block . In block the system can close the current view of the browser in which the electronic document has been rendered. In block the system can delete any portion of the historical record relating to the electronic document as opened within the view of the browser closed in block . In block the system can create a new view e.g. a window or a tab. In block the system can activate private browsing mode for the new view. As noted blocks and can be performed concurrently. In block the system can render the electronic document within the new view.

The electronic document when rendered by the browser can call a function via the PBM API to determine whether private browsing mode is activated in the current view. The function of the PBM API can return a result indicating whether private browsing mode is activated for the current view in which the electronic document is rendered. When private browsing mode is not activated based upon the result returned by the function the electronic document can display the control which can be specified within or as part of the electronic document. In this manner the location and or type of control that is presented can be dictated by the electronic document rather than the browser. Correspondingly when private browsing mode is activated for the current view the electronic document can be displayed without the control.

In another aspect with various electronic documents having the ability to indicate that private browsing mode should be invoked to view the electronic document search results can be presented within an electronic document in which those results to be opened in private browsing mode are distinguished from those results not to be opened in private browsing mode.

Method can begin in bock where an electronic document can be received. For example the electronic document can include search results received in response to a query or search. In block the system can identify URIs referenced by selectable links e.g. hyperlinks within the electronic document. In block the system can determine which of the URIs match private browsing mode criteria stored as part of the extension. As discussed the extension can maintain a list of items such as URIs and or patterns e.g. portions of URIs. When a link within the electronic document specifies a URI matching an item in the list the link and the electronic document referenced by the link can be said to be associated with a PBM indicator.

In block the system optionally can modify the electronic document. In one aspect the system can modify the electronic document to visually distinguish links in the electronic document that are associated with a PBM indicator from links in the electronic document that are not associated with a PBM indicator. The system can rewrite the electronic document to include program code adding a visualization technique to the links to be distinguished such as different coloring underlining placing an additional control proximate to the link etc.

In another aspect those links determined to be associated with a PBM indicator can be rewritten with one or more attributes that when interpreted by the browser force the browser to open the electronic document referenced by the link in a new view in which private browsing mode is activated. For example the link can be rewritten to include a link attribute such as target private browsing or include another directive that is inserted into the URI that is understandable by the browser. In another example when a control is added selection of the control can cause the browser to open the electronic document associated with the control in a new view in which private browsing mode is activated.

In block the system can render the electronic document within a currently open view. For purposes of discussion it can be assumed that private browsing mode is not activated in the current view in which the search results are presented.

In block a user selection of a link associated with a PBM indicator can be received by the system. In step the system can create a new view for the browser. In block private browsing mode can be activated in the new view. In block the electronic document referenced by the selected link can be rendered within the new view. As noted blocks can be performed concurrently.

In the example presented in an electronic document is rendered within view . Electronic document presents a list of links e.g. search results located responsive to a search or query. Each of links can reference or specify a corresponding URI for an electronic document that can be opened responsive to a selection of the link. The extension has compared each of the URIs corresponding to links to the list of items e.g. the private browsing mode criteria and determined that link and link each match at least one item on the list. As such link and link can be said to include or be associated with a PBM indicator. Accordingly the extension alters the electronic document so that link and link are visually distinguished from link and link . In this example underlining is used as the mechanism for visually distinguishing links though any of a variety of different techniques can be used.

As noted another technique for visually distinguishing one link from another can include displaying an additional indicator or control such as control or control proximate to the link to be distinguished. Referring to control is displayed immediately next to link or within a predetermined distance of link within view in order to demonstrate an association with link . Similarly control is displayed immediately next to link or within a predetermined distance of link within view in order to demonstrate an association with link .

Responsive to a user input selecting control the system can create a new view in which private browsing mode is activated and the electronic document referenced by link is retrieved and rendered. Similarly responsive to a user input selecting control the system can create a new view in which private browsing mode is activated and the electronic document referenced by link is retrieved and rendered. By maintaining a list of criteria for URIs that can be considered PBM indicators a developer can determine that an entire class of electronic documents from a particular Website is to be opened using private browsing mode.

The embodiments disclosed within this specification allow developers to activate private browsing mode or to at least suggest using private browsing mode for electronic documents accessed via a browser within a computing system. Thus rather than restricting activation of private browsing mode to end users activation of private browsing mode can be facilitated by way of the browser itself in response to detecting particular PBM indicators associated with electronic documents by developers.
