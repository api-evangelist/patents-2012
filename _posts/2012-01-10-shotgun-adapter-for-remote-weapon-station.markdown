title: Shotgun adapter for remote weapon station
abstract: An attachment is provided for operably connecting a shotgun to a weapons station. The shotgun includes a trigger and a butt stock. The weapons station can accommodate one of a Mk19 grenade launcher, an M2 .50 cal machine gun and an M240G machine gun. The attachment includes a trigger module, a pump grip adapter, and a gun frame. The module actuates the trigger and includes an actuator for pulling the trigger and an adapter for engaging the butt stock. The pump grip adapter includes slots for traveling pins on the weapons station to absorb recoil. The gun frame enables installation of the shotgun therein and mounts the trigger module and the adapter to the weapon station.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to shotgun adapters. In particular the invention relates to adaptation systems that enable a shotgun to be installed onto a remote weapons station.

A variety of small arms fire weapons can be installed onto a remote weapons station for infantry support. Such weapons include the Mk19 grenade launcher M2 .50 cal machine gun or M240G machine gun.

Conventional infantry weapon adapters yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular the embodied adapters provide for incorporation of a shotgun to a remote weapons station.

Various exemplary embodiments provide an adapter for operably connecting a shotgun to a weapons platform. The shotgun includes a body a pump grip a trigger and a butt stock. The weapons station can similarly accommodate one of a variety of weapons including the Mk19 grenade launcher the M2 .50 cal machine gun and the M240G machine gun. The adapter includes a trigger module a pump grip adapter a slide release mechanism a charging linkage and a gun frame. The module actuates the trigger and includes an actuator for pulling the trigger as well as an adapter for engaging the butt stock.

The pump grip adapter includes a boss and through hole to interface with the charging linkage. The slide release mechanism allows the gun to be cycled out of sequence. The charging linkage allows the RWS to pump the gun by interfacing with the pump grip adapter and slide release mechanism. The gun frame enables installation of the shotgun therein and mounts the trigger module and the adapter to the station.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.

Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Various exemplary embodiments enable a Mossberg 500 or similar shotgun to be mounted in any remote weapon station RWS originally designed to hold a weapon e.g. a Mk19 grenade launcher or an M2 .50 cal machine gun. The M1126 Stryker infantry carrier vehicle represents an exemplary RWS.

In addition to securing the weapon in position various exemplary embodiments enable the shotgun to be fired remotely and cycled. The exemplary designs provide for quick installation and removal of the shotgun. Conventional designs lack any standard manner to mount a shotgun in a remote gun mount that were originally designed to contain the Mk19 or the M2 .50 cal.

The exemplary fixture can be reduced to five main parts a Trigger Module or Assembly a Pump Grip Adapter a Slide Release Mechanism a Charging Linkage and a Gun Frame. show isometric assembly views of the Trigger Module . shows an isometric exploded view of The Trigger Module contained within a see through housing box . This box houses a solenoid integrated with a base a helical spring and a linkage that facilitates the remote firing of the shotgun. The spring coils around a transverse rod .

The linkage connects to the solenoid . The Module bolts onto the rear of the shotgun using a butt stock adapter in place of the standard butt stock. The adapter attaches to the base . A shoulder bolt attaches an actuator bridge to the box . A mezzanine rod attaches the linkage to the bridge . A trigger rod extends across the bridge to engage the shotgun s trigger.

The Adapter includes mount plates and for providing structural support. At the proximal and distal ends the Adapter includes an ingress and an egress both substantially cylindrical for the Tube Magazine shown in to extend therethrough.

Release pins enable convenient removal of the shotgun without disassembling the Adapter Assembly . Viewed from below in the second embodiment includes a Slide Release Mechanism and a Charging Linkage . A boss connects the Adapter along the slot with the Charging Linkage behind the shotgun s trigger on the side flanges . The second embodiment also includes the distal frame and a proximal frame connected by side flanges .

A first tube attaches to the first connector and a second tube attaches to the second connector . Two quick release pins enable release of the shotgun without removing the entire adapter. A linkage connects the pump action pin to the RWS charging actuator.

Various exemplary embodiments provide advantages in enabling a shotgun capability to be adapted to any remote gun mount that is capable of firing the Ml19 grenade launcher the M2 .50 cal machine gun or the M240G machine gun without any modifications being made to the mount.

Materials used for the initial invention are aluminum and steel. Alternative materials could be used depending on their strength characteristics. Alternative solenoids can be used as long as they meet the force and power requirements. The original design incorporated the Mossberg 500 series shotgun although other shotguns are adaptable. The equipment located on top of the adapter is specific to the original application other equipment can be installed as required.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
