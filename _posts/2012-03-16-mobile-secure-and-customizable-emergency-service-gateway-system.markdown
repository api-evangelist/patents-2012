These logs can consist of configuration logging that involves date time and user changing the system configuration runtime logging involving runtime logging of events such as link s going up or down policy logging such as when routing changes are done by the mobility module involves logging that logs the switching among the uplinks and kit location changes based on the GPS coordinates. The multilevel logging also involves logging sensor data such capture sensor data or policy action taken based on the sensor data can be saved locally on the system or pushed out to centralized logging server or cloud based logging systems simultaneously.

Local logging is enabled on the read only system. These logs may be lost when the system reboot occurs. Logging may be enabled on the local driver or gateway partition. Logging may be enabled on a remote system also wherein the applications module is leveraged to push the logs to the remote system.

The logging module is responsible for creating and maintaining of logs of various events like link changes routing modifications configuration changes user inputs sensor and actuator data and tracking data. This module gets notifications from various modules in the system. These notifications can be saved in one or databases or file systems. The logged data can be retrieved later on for analysis and co relation.

As shown in the tracking module enables the data logging data conversion and trend tracking for the main elements that require historical data and leverage Heuristic methods for decision making. The tracking module also stores the data locally. The tracking module interacts with the other main elements for providing raw and processed information about the collected data points. The tracking module also uses algorithms and logic to derive the data convert the data formats as needed by the other main elements.

The tracking module is used by the system to maintain data logging data format conversion and tracking trends based on post processing of data gathered during data logging. The user configuration and automated triggers influences the tracking module functionality in terms of the system resources usage. The tracking module can be applied to voice video and sensor information processing and data storage. The tracking modules can leverage open source or commercial implementation for parts of the following modules.

The data logger is initialized and triggered by the other system modules. The data logger maintains the sensor readings with timestamp. The data logger can request the information from a device e.g. sensor or the information can be pushed into the data logger. The data logger is also responsible to compress archive and push the data to the cloud based storage servers. The data logger can limit the number of records that it logs and it can always maintain the latest records and discard or save the old records either locally or on remote servers. The data logger can leverage databases to store the data locally.

Data conversion is triggered when the system requires translation of data formats. For example the XML formats may be changed by web services or for integration with systems that accept a certain data XML syntax. This module allows the conversion of data formats to either send or receive the data from an external local remote system. This module can be used to enable interoperability between the systems with different data formats for publishing or subscribing the information.

Trend tracking involves post processing of data collected using data logger and data conversion sub modules. Algorithms mathematical formulas or signal processing techniques can be applied to the date to derive the result sets. For example based on the GPS location combined with the latitude and longitude calculations the mobile communication unit can intelligently derive its location on earth.

A GPS module can be used to get the location of the mobile communication unit at any given moment in time. Smartphones or modems having GPS capability can also be used to get the geographic location of the mobile communication unit . The tracking module periodically logs the records.

A user can set forth a policy based on location. With a change in geographic location the policy engine will check if there are any configured actions e.g. use one uplink over the other related to the current location. If any actions are identified the policy engine will trigger appropriate action.

The system is used to translate between different data formats on IP connected local or remote servers or systems. The tracking module can be comprised of a GPS device GPS enabled modems or GPS enabled smartphone connected to the mobile communication unit . The GPS device sends geographical location to the mobile communication unit or the mobile communication unit polls the modem and or smartphone to get the geographical location. The geographical information available is sent to the logging module mobility module and any other module looking for the information.

As illustrated in the configuration module provides configuration management for the overall system. This module enables local or remote Graphical User Interface GUI based configuration options and its respective back end. The other configuration methods include thin client thick client web based configuration command line interface CLI LCD devices for showing and changing configuration or programmable input from remote systems via IP networks digital or analog I O based triggers and the like.

The configuration module provides multiple interfaces to the users for configuration control monitor and track one or more systems. The configuration module coordinates the information from multiple different user interfaces and saves a single copy of configuration. The configuration module moderates between the different user interfaces to ensure that the configuration is in sync for all the user configuration input and output operations. The different user interfaces enabled by configuration modules include desktop interface web interface smartphone interface command line interface.

The configuration module also maintains the default configuration and maintains backup of the system configuration. It interacts with application module to monitor the system configuration reset conditions to restore the factory defaults and the like. The backup and default configuration can be restored based on the input from the connected devices. Application programming interfaces are also enabled by the configuration module to pragmatically manage the configuration elements over IP network and based on certain monitored events.

The configuration module is also responsible for parsing the user configuration and generate the internal configuration for the different system modules. One variation of configuration module is a desktop application wherein a desktop based interface is an application installed on and running off a desktop computer or a laptop. This application allows the user to connect to a mobile communication unit from the wired or wireless LAN or WAN. This desktop interface could also connect to the other remote sites connected to the same central communication unit . This application gives complete configuration capability to the user. The user can also check system statistics.

Another variation of configuration module is a web Interface. The system can have a web server running on it. This web server provides a web interface to all devices connected on the LAN. These devices may include computer systems smart phones netbooks and the like which have a web browser to view a standard web application.

Another variation of configuration module is a smartphone application. These applications could include IPHONE IPAD applications or ANDROID applications. These applications could get or set system configurations and statistics by communicating with the host system using TCP IP connection from the LAN.

Another variation of configuration module is a command line interface CLI . This CLI communicates to the host system over TCP IP connection over the LAN. The CLI can be invoked from any computer system laptop netbook smartphone that is connected to the LAN and has a standard SSH or serial console based configuration capability.

The mobile communication unit can be used as an automation controller for just the integration of sensors actuators devices and systems. This is useful for M2M applications for remote sites that are used for automated monitoring triggers data logging and sensor management.

The mobile communication unit can be used as an enhanced IP gateway that provides IP security and IP mobility over one or more WAN uplinks. Users may also be able to connect computers sensors devices systems and actuators on the local area network and over the other available interfaces such as serial USB BLUETOOTH and the like.

The mobile communication unit can be used for IP mobility management for both Ipv4 and Ipv6 using a method that does not depend on Mobile IP protocol. The VPN tunnels can be established from another router behind the mobile communication unit .

The mobile communication unit can be used to support other similar systems in a mesh networking environment or where multiple systems aggregate together. An example could be that multiple personal area gateways PAG converge on a bigger system that provides a higher bandwidth for the overall end to end solution.

The mobile communication unit can be used for enabling a secure VPN without using any mobility features. This can function as a gateway that secures the traffic from LAN to connect to their respective intranet. The VPN tunnels IPSEC or SSL VPN secures the traffic over the public internet. The WAN interfaces connect to the internet. The mobile communication unit also runs the firewall and router features to enable a robust IP gateway system.

The mobile communication unit can be used just as an IP gateway without using either security or mobility. This can be used to enable a hot spot from cellular 3G 4G to Ethernet Wi Fi and the like. The mobile communication unit can have other features such as Network Address Translation NAT firewall QOS and other IP gateway features including configuration management. The mobile communication unit can be used to build a custom IP gateway for Communications Security COMSEC and additional encryption modules can be added on the LAN to further secure the IP payload.

The mobile communication unit can be used to build to fit in a rugged and portable packaging to provide a mobile and always best connected kit for enabling the intranet connectivity for the remote mobile and tactical missions. The system can be further optimized by either adding acceleration modules e.g. TCP acceleration for performance optimization over high latency networks such as satellite based backhaul connectivity.

As illustrated in of the drawings communications are initiated between the mobile communication unit and at least a first telecommunication network . It is preferable that the mobile communication unit be in communication with more than one telecommunication network. Hence the mobile communication unit further initiates communications with a second telecommunication network a third telecommunication network and fourth telecommunication network and possibly more telecommunication networks. illustrates an example of using four telecommunication networks to transfer information e.g. voice communications electronic data etc. between the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit .

After one or more available telecommunication networks have been identified the mobile communication unit then calculates which of the available telecommunication networks that should be used to communicate through between the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit based on various factors e.g. network base score network signal strength network bandwidth network history network location total network bandwidth used for the month etc. . A network score is provided for each of the available telecommunication networks. If only one telecommunication network is available that network would have the highest ranking.

If more than one telecommunication network is available the networks are then ranked based upon their respective network scores i.e. the higher the network score the higher the ranking The mobile communication unit will communicate via the highest ranking telecommunication networks unless they manually override the system to a selected telecommunication network s or parameters have been set that automatically override the ranking system. For example if a sensor in communication with the mobile communication unit detects rain or high humidity a microwave network or a satellite network may be removed from the list or moved toward the bottom of the list with the communications transferred to a cellular based telecommunications network. As another example if a sensor in communication with the mobile communication unit detects a low temperature that is below a threshold level a microwave network or satellite network may be removed and the communications transferred to a cellular network. As another example if the mobile communication unit is in a geographical location that has a preferred telecommunication network identified by the user such as VERIZON 3G the preferred telecommunication network will be moved to the top of the list and used for the main communications. In addition the mobile communication unit may also be preset to only consider telecommunication networks that have a network score exceeding a threshold level i.e. a minimum network score . illustrates some sample scores provided for various types of networks and signal strength e.g. specific telecommunication networks can have a higher base score compared to other networks etc. .

The mobile communication unit communicates via one or more of the available telecommunication networks based upon the preset configuration. For example if four networks are available but the user has preset to only communicate via three networks the mobile communication unit will select the three best telecommunication networks based on the parameters set by the user and the factors present. The LAN devices in communication with the mobile communication unit maintain the same IP address while using or switching traffic between various communication channels and or VPN tunnels.

While a VPN connection is not required for the present invention it is preferable that at least one VPN connection be created between the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit . After one or more telecommunication networks have been identified and selected the mobile communication unit automatically creates the desired number of VPN connections between the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit as illustrated in of the drawings. The mobile communication unit may be set to establish a single VPN connection via each of the different telecommunication networks as shown in of the drawings. The mobile communication may also be set to establish multiple VPN connections via a preferred telecommunication network e.g. VERIZON 3G 4G LTE network as illustrated in FIG. of the drawings. While not required it is preferable that one or more or all of the VPN connections be comprised of secure sockets layer SSL VPN connections.

After the communication channels have been established between the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit data is transmitted between the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit via the preferred telecommunication network s . The mobile communication unit can be preset to attempt to use the best or the preferred telecommunication network for all data communications. In addition the mobile communication unit can be preset to offload a portion of the data communications to a second or more telecommunication network during load balancing with the heavier data traffic preferably going through the first ranked telecommunication network and the remaining data traffic going through the remaining telecommunication network s . If one of the telecommunication networks become unavailable or incurs a lower network score the mobile communication unit automatically adjusts the data traffic accordingly to ensure that the data communications from the mobile communication unit and the central communication unit are uninterrupted and continue along the best possible rate.

Before powering on the mobile communication unit the user checks that it is connected with multiple WAN uplink hardware such as USB based 3G 4G data cards modems on board or USB based Ethernet Wi Fi and the like. It is not mandatory to have multiple uplinks via multiple telecommunication networks for the operation however the IP mobility is only possible when more than one uplink is available. The user ensures that peripheral devices such as uplink devices are connected to the computer or the smart phone that is running the system. The user then powers on the hardware that powers the mobile communication unit and its peripherals. The USB based devices often get the power from the mobile communication unit or an external hub. The operating system comes up before the other main elements. The operating system runs on a CPU and the operating system can be mounted as a read only file system.

Once the interfaces that constitute the WAN IP uplinks are UP the interface monitor sub element starts monitoring the interface s to qualify them to be used by the other main and sub elements of the system. provides the details of the uplink monitor process and its interaction with the configuration module VPN module and mobility module as a part of the Qualification Layer. The uplink monitor process takes into account the user configuration and manual input regarding the uplink priority. The state of the uplinks can also be influenced by the manual intervention. For example if the user has decided to administratively shutdown the interface then that interface will not be qualified by the uplink monitor process Interface Monitor sub element for use by the other main and sub modules of the system. This dynamic intelligence is programmed in this process to track the real time states of all the connected interfaces.

The uplink monitor process also tracks the information and parameters such as signal strength uplink technology and related factors. The devices module along with the applications module as shown in shows the integration of the devices using device drivers Software Development Kits SDK or Application Programming Interfaces API . These software drivers SDK or API are built by either leveraging the specifications or software samples provided by the device vendors or specifically developed for the purpose of integration of devices in the system. The information from the Qualification Layer is passed within the application module to the Policy Conditioning Layer and Policy Action Layer using software controllers. The software controllers process and correlate the information using data correlation sub element. The processed information is then forwarded to the interface monitor sub element and the link score module network scoring for use by VPN module and mobility module.

The VPN manager gets uplink status notifications from the uplink monitor process. The VPN manager also creates IP table entries for each uplink. If a link up notification is received the VPN manager start a VPN tunnel to the central communication unit . Each tunnel is established using a unique source port and the same destination port for the central communication unit . Once the tunnel is established the VPN Manager creates IP routing rules for packets originating from each source port. The rule tells the OS to mark each packet appropriately and use the corresponding IP routing table when sending and receiving packets to the central communication unit thru that VPN tunnel. If a link down notification is received from the uplink monitor process the VPN manager stops the VPN tunnel. When a tunnel is established or destroyed the VPN manager reports the events to the mobility module and other processes.

The mobility module reads the user specified configuration to identify the priority and preference of each uplink. It waits for link notifications from the uplink monitor process and VPN manager. When any notification arrives the mobility module calculates the weighted score of each uplink to identify the best available uplink. If the current uplink is the best the further action is required but if current uplink is not the best the mobility module updates the default route to use the best link as the uplink. It then notifies the other processes about the change in the uplink. The mobility process also looks for user inputs if a user forces to switch to one of the available uplinks. In this case all other uplinks are given a score of zero and routing changes are done to use user specified link as the uplink. mobility module also looks for notifications form the tracking module. If a location change event arrives and it matches user preference for a geographical location the mobility module modifies the routing to use the best link based on the user s geographical location preference. Every change in uplink is broadcasted to the other modules so that various modules can update accordingly e.g. user interface updates the uplink LCD shows which link is in use logging module logs the switch in the uplink etc .

The application module covers the overall functionality of the system. The applications module comprises of various standalone modules which interact and control individual functionality and communicate with each other over message bus. The following is a non exhaustive list of some of the controllers LCD controller battery controller GSM controller CDMA controller fan controller Wi Fi controller GPS controller VPN manager mobility manager and the like. On boot up the system toggles the relay to turn ON the power for USB hub fan and LCD module. It also starts the various controller software as a service. If a device is available the controller starts communicating with it otherwise it waits for the device to be plugged in or become available.

The battery controller periodically checks the battery status for the mobile communication unit . As the battery charge goes low it notifies the user by glowing the status LEDs and showing the battery capacity left on the LCD.

The LCD controller looks for notifications about the VPN tunnels Uplinks GPS locations battery status and the like from various components and updates the status messages on the LCD. Along with this buttons on the LCD module are used to take user input. Appropriate action is taken by the LCD controller based on the buttons clicked by the user.

The CDMA GSM 4G LTE controllers leverage the SDKs provided by modem manufacturers to control the cellular devices. These controllers get cellular notifications related to signal strength technology change and notify other modules e.g. Uplink Monitor Process LCD Module etc. . These controllers also start up the the PPP call to establish the data channel over the cellular network.

The GPS controller reads the GPS locations from the GPS device and notifies other modules about the updated geographic location. The Wifi controller keeps track of the Wifi network connectivity. If pre configured Wifi Network becomes available it associates with it and notifies the Uplink Monitor Process and other processes. Similarly if a connected network goes down or out of range the Wifi controller goes back to search mode after notifying the other processes about the link down activity.

The configuration module covers the various user interfaces that allows user to set the system configurations and settings and get system status and notifications. The configuration can have various form factors like a web Interface computer resident application smart phone application or a command line interface.

The web interface is a standard web server running on the mobile communication unit communicating with various application modules over the message bus. This module provides a set of web pages to the user to get or set system configurations and a dashboard page which shows quick statistics of the system. A user can access this web page from the LAN side of the local kit or any mobile communication unit using a standard web browser on a laptop netbook or a smart phone.

The computer application is an application installed on a computer laptop netbook etc. . The computer application connects to the local system or a remote system over message bus using TCP IP sockets. The computer application provides system setup capabilities and dashboard capabilities to the user.

The smartphone application is a resident application on a smartphone which communicates to the system by making a TCP IP connection to the system from the LAN side. Similar to the computer application the smartphone application allows the user to configure the system and get various notifications.

The Command Line Interface CLI is a text based configuration which connects to the system over standard SSH telnet capability. This interface also allows the user to get and set system configurations.

The logging module listens to various events of the systems and logs then in one or more files. The events range from link notifications VPN up down events mobility events e.g. like change in uplink location based events e.g. like change in geographic location user events e.g. updating link priorities choosing an uplink from available uplinks changing policy actions related to geographic location etc. .

The mobile communication unit can be deployed as a tactical communications kit or a mobile kit that provides local hotspot using Wi Fi access point connected to the system using Ethernet port. The system can also provide Ethernet based local area network LAN connectivity . The sensors devices and systems can be connected to the mobile communication unit . The Voice over IP and Video Over IP devices can be also attached over IP network. Ethernet or USB based devices can also Video and Audio capability to the system. The Push To Talk Radios can also be attached to the remotely deployed system. The System modules enable the Communications capabilities Security Mobility and also allow the system to function as an Automation controller for the attached sensors. shows multiple systems deployed with Voice Video Data and Sensor capability. also shows multiple Wide Area Network WAN capability using 3G 4G cellular data cards that use GSM CDMA. The other WAN options are Satellite Wi Fi including the public Wi Fi hotspots . Satellite based uplinks can be connected to the system over Serial or Ethernet.

Most of the WAN uplinks provide dynamic address to the mobile communication unit . The CDMA and GSM uplinks use PPP establish IP connectivity. Each of these uplinks are represented as an interface on the Operating System. The interfaces corresponding to these 3G 4G IP uplinks are created on the operating system when the uplinks connect successfully to the Service Provider using PPP. The Ethernet and Wi Fi based uplink options use DHCP Client on the Operating System gateway module. The address assigned to the kits on the WAN interfaces can be public address a unique IP address that can be routed on internet or private address an address that are translated to public address by the service provider . The system modules such as VPN module sets up secure IPSec or SSL tunnel based on the security and crypto configuration. The secure tunnels originate at the system and terminate on central communication unit or VPN Aggregator. These tunnels are traverse the internet and securely carry the IP data from the system to the central communication unit VPN aggregator. The VPN tunnels are setup and maintained by the VPN module. The VPN tunnels terminate on new interfaces on the operating system.

The mobility module enables the mobility among the available uplinks. It has two main functions. It checks the quality of uplinks by tracking multiple parameters such as signal strength technology user defined priority and stability etc. and decides the best available uplink. The mobility module manipulates the IP routing using the gateway module and its routing sub module. The routing table is changed to ensure that the traffic from LAN and locally originated sensor and data traffic chooses the VPN tunnel that corresponds to the best available uplink. The switching between the multiple uplinks is done by dynamically changing the routing. This automated switching does not disrupt the traffic going to the central communication unit and thus maintains seamless mobility across multiple available uplinks.

The mobile communication unit unique implementation design and architecture method enables its use as a communications platform and as an automation controller with modularity and flexibility. The mobile communication unit can be used for various applications such as a home gateway industrial automation controller communications security gateway mobile gateway sensor aggregator data logger and many more user defined applications.

If the user prefers use the mobile communication unit just as a plain IP gateway without the mobility or security the mobile communication unit also offers the configuration ability to enable IP gateway mode that only enables simple routing over one of the WAN uplinks. This method is also very useful when setting up public Wi Fi hotspots WAN uplinks for the system. Typical Wi Fi hotspots require the users to interact with a flash page default page before opening access to the internet. These flash page could provide user an option to agree to their terms and conditions or have the user authenticate or pay for the services. Using the IP gateway mode user can connect to the desired Wi Fi network. The users from the LAN side can then use any standard web browser to get to the default flash page to enable internet access. The IP gateway mode enables IP Network Address Translation NAT between the local area network LAN and the Wide Area Network WAN uplink.

The mobile communication unit can be packaged in a rugged and environmentally resistant case based on the user requirements. Multiple mobile communication units can also be configured to scale up customizing the applications modules to leverage the devices module that are part of the other mobile communication unit reachable remotely or over LAN. shows an examples of one such system that leverages a middle ware message bus to communicate among the system. Such methods can be also used to offload some processing to another system and to optimize the resources based on the end to end solution requirements.
