Millions of users worldwide utilize a social network in order to communicate and share information with family members and friends. A social network for example Facebook LinkedIn or Google Plus may include a website or an Internet based service which allows users to create and maintain a personal profile or personal page to befriend or to like or to follow other users to share text and images with other users to perform blogging activities or the like.

A user of a social network may create a personal profile or a personal page in which he may store data intended for sharing with other users of the social network data which may be referred to as social information . Social information may include for example an image or photograph of the user a gender of the user an age or a date of birth of the user a marital status or family status of a user a profession or occupation of the user current and past employer s of the user current or past school s attended by the user a hobby or interest of the user a city or state or country in which the user lives or originates or the like.

The present invention may include for example devices systems methods computerized programs and computerized application for sharing social information among users. For example a user may access an airline website in order to reserve a flight. The user may consent to sharing his social information with other passengers on that flight and upon such consent the user may be able to view social information of fellow passengers on that particular flight. Furthermore when the user selects a seat on that flight the user may be presented with a seating chart or a seating map showing available and occupied seats augmented by social information of passengers in occupied seats.

In accordance with the present invention for example a method of sharing social information may include obtaining from a social network social information of passengers associated with a flight and presenting said social information to a prospective passenger of said flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the obtaining may include obtaining from the social network in bulk social information of at least two passengers associated with a flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the obtaining may include sending a query which includes an identifier of said flight and which excludes any identifier of any passenger on said flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the obtaining may include in response to a single query identifying only a particular flight obtaining a batch of social information items of at least two passengers on said particular flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the presenting may include presenting a seating map for said flight indicating available seats and occupied seats and for at least one occupied seat presenting social information of a passenger occupying said occupied seat.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include calculating a social relevance score for each one of said passengers associated with said flight and ranking said passengers based on said social relevance score.

In accordance with the present invention for example calculating the social relevance score may include identifying common traits among passengers of said flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include allocating a first weight to a first common trait of a pair of passengers and allocating a second different weight to a second common trait of said pair of passengers.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include based on said ranking matching between a first passenger of said flight and one or more other passengers of interest to said first passenger.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include receiving flight identification data from a flight booking system obtaining social information of passengers for said flight serving to said flight booking system said social information.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include establishing a first instance of Oauth protocol with a social network comprising assigning to the social network a role of a server and assigning to an intermediate module a role of a client and establishing a second separate instance of OAuth protocol with a flight booking system comprising assigning to the intermediate module a role of a server and assigning to the flight booking system a role of a client.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include displaying a flight search result page which comprises identifiers of one or more flights and social information of passengers in each one of said one or more flights.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include presenting a seating map for said flight indicating available seats and occupied seats and presenting near the seating map a social widget for displaying social information of passengers in said flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include presenting a mock widget to elicit a user to log in into a service which permits said user to share social information with other passengers on said flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include displaying a seat map of said flight the seat map indicating which one or more seats are available and which one or more seats are reserved and upon a user pointing at a reserved seat on said seat map displaying social information of a passenger that reserved said seat.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include displaying a seat map of said flight the seat map indicating which one or more seats are available and which one or more seats are reserved and for at least one seat that is reserved displaying at a location of said seat in the seat map an image of a passenger that reserved said seat.

In accordance with the present invention for example the obtaining may include obtaining social information of at least a first passenger and a second passenger on said flight wherein the first passenger is a passenger who booked the flight through a website of an airline that operates said flight and wherein the second passenger is a passenger who booked the flight through a website external to the website of said airline that operates said flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include suggesting to said prospective passenger a seat in said flight based on one or more common traits identified by matching between social information of said prospective passenger and social information of other one or more passengers on said flights.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include taking into account a feedback received from said prospective passenger regarding a previously performed seat selection that was based on social information in a previous flight.

In accordance with the present invention for example the method may include sending to said prospective passenger a notification indicating a change in seating assignment of another passenger on said flight the notification indicating a seat of said other passenger on said flight and further including social network information of said other passenger.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of some embodiments. However it will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art that some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components units and or circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the discussion.

The present invention may allow sharing of social information among prospective passengers who utilize an airline website or a flight reservation website. A user who considers or intends to reserve a particular flight or is in the process of reserving a particular flight may choose to share his social information with other passengers on that flight. The user may then be able to view the social information of other passengers on that flight who consented to share their social information with fellow passengers. Particularly in a seat selection process a seating chart may be augmented with social information of passengers thereby allowing the user to select a seat by taking into account the social information of other passengers in nearby seats. The present invention may be implemented for example within an airline booking system or website e.g. a website such as United.com or Delta.com within an Online Travel Agency OTA system or website e.g. a website such as Expedia.com or Orbitz.com or the like.

Reference is made to which is a schematic block diagram illustration of entities and modules which may participate in a demonstrative implementation of the present invention. As shown in a traveler may utilize an information sharing application ISA which may be able to communicate with an airline OTA system and with a social network .

Social network information of travelers may be shared among consenting travelers without requiring airline OTA system to provide any information and without requiring airline OTA system to pass to ISA any personal information of traveler e.g. the real life name of traveler or his passport number . Rather ISA may ask traveler for his permission or consent to obtain his social information directly from social network and to share his obtained social information with fellow travelers within the scope of airline OTA system .

ISA may request permissions obtain information and share information in accordance with a suitable protocol or standard for example OAuth standard OAuth 1.0 standard OAuth 2.0 or the like optionally utilizing also a suitable user authentication standard e.g. OpenID standard . In a demonstrative implementation ISA may utilize the OAuth standard which may assign four roles for example a resource owner a client a resource server and an authorization server. In interactions among ISA traveler and social network the role of resource owner may be assigned to traveler the role of the client may be assigned to ISA and the roles of resource server and authorization server may be assigned to social network . In interactions among ISA traveler and airline OTA system the role of the resource owner may still be assigned to traveler whereas the role of the client may be assigned to airline OTA system and whereas the roles of the resource server and authentication server may be assigned to ISA .

An end to end process of authenticating traveler and accessing his social information may be achieved for example by combining two separate OAuth like protocols. For example a first OAuth protocol may be implemented between ISA and social network and a second OAuth protocol may be implemented between ISA and airline OTA system . ISA may operate as the client when accessing social information of traveler on social network and ISA may operate as the resource server and authentication server when providing or serving the social information of traveler to airline OTA system .

Traveler may utilize a computer or mobile phone or other electronic device to access a website of airline OTA system for example in order to search for a flight or to book a flight. Traveler may be presented with an option to share and view social information. If traveler approves the website of airline OTA system may redirect traveler to an authentication page or module of ISA e.g. a user authentication URL of ISA thereby triggering a first OAuth flow between ISA and airline OTA system . Upon such redirection from airline OTA system to ISA user authentication may be performed by ISA in order to obtain user permission to access his social information. For example ISA may display to traveler a login screen with an option to log in to one of multiple social networks e.g. Facebook LinkedIn Google Plus . Accordingly ISA may request from traveler his permission to access his information in one of several social network by logging into a particular social network for example redirecting traveler to an authentication URL of a particular user selected social network thereby triggering a second OAuth flow between ISA and social network . Traveler may thus be presented with a login screen of social network or the login screen may be bypassed if traveler is already logged in to social network and then a form or question may be displayed to obtain approval of traveler for sharing his social information with ISA . Once traveler approves such sharing he may be redirected back to ISA where he may be presented with a form or a question to obtain approval of traveler for sharing his social information with airline OTA system . Once traveler approves he may be redirected back to airline OTA system thereby completing the authorization flow and allowing airline OTA system to access the social information of traveler indirectly through ISA . For example a token may be provided by ISA to airline OTA system upon successful authentication and airline OTA system may utilize that token in subsequent queries.

It would be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art that in the above described flow airline OTA system may not provide any data about traveler rather data about traveler may only be retrieved from social network after obtaining permission of traveler . Accordingly during user authentication and user authorization no user data is provided by airline OTA system or by a particular airline which operates airline OTA system . Once traveler is authenticated by ISA and once traveler authorizes airline OTA system to access the social information of traveler through ISA then airline OTA system may query ISA on behalf of traveler . The query may be for example a query for information about all travelers on a particular flight that traveler booked already or considers booking. The query may indicate the airline or carrier the fight number and the flight date whereas the query may not indicate the real life name or a passport number or a national ID card number of traveler or of other passengers on that flight. In response to such query ISA may provide to airline OTA system the social information of passengers on the queried flights such social information including for example a screen name or user name of each such passenger on social network an image of such passenger a gender of such passenger an age of such passenger or the like. Subsequently traveler may select a seat on the flight and airline OTA system may indicate to ISA the seat location and a token pointing to the social data of the seat holder the token then being used by ISA to obtain the social data of the seat holder from social network . ISA in turn may save or store links between seats and travelers that were already resolved and such data may be provided to airline OTA system in a subsequent query.

Traveler may search for flights through airline OTA system and may show interest in a particular flight. Airline OTA system may request from ISA social information of travelers on that particular flight. ISA may retrieve the list of travelers whose seats on this flight were already reported by airline OTA system to ISA and ISA may obtain the social information of such travelers from social network and may provide such social information back to airline OTA system which may display the social information to traveler . Upon flight selection and seat selection by traveler airline OTA system may notify ISA of such flight selection and seat selection and ISA may store this information to be used in a subsequent query from airline OTA system .

Optionally ISA may be integrated into a website of an airline or an OTA at one or more suitable web pages or place s within a web page. The interaction of traveler with ISA may include for example signing in by traveler into the service provided by ISA displaying social information of fellow travelers and optionally passenger list on flight search result page s and or on flight details page s and displaying social information of passengers and optionally passenger list on or with a seat map of a particular flight.

Reference is also made to which is a block diagram illustration of ISA and its components and modules in accordance with the present invention. ISA may include for example an OAuth control module a social information fetching module a social information serving module a sign in module sharing approval module a triggering module a mock social widget generator a flight details page augmenter a flight search results augmenter a flight seat map augmenter a ranking module a matching module social information merger privacy module a statistics module a reporting module a feedback module a seat map database a seat map updater and or other suitable hardware components and or software modules. Some components or modules may be implemented using a processor or a computer program or may be combined or integrated into one unit or into multiple sub units.

OAuth module may establish and operate the multiple sessions of OAuth which may be used by ISA as detailed above such that ISA may obtain the social information as a client from social network and may provide the social information as a server to airline OTA system . Social information fetching module may be responsible for fetching or obtaining the social information from social network whereas social information serving module may be responsible for serving or providing the obtained social information to airline OTA system .

Sign in module may handle signing in or logging in of traveler which may be required of traveler in order to provide and or receive social information. A user who browses an airline website or an OTA website without logging in to ISA may not be able to view social information of other travelers and may not be able to share his social information with other travelers.

Sharing approval module may handle the process of obtaining approval from traveler to share his social information with fellow travelers. For example once traveler logs in into ISA and provides user consent to share social information on an airline or OTA website the social information of fellow travelers may become available to traveler . Traveler may sign in and provide his consent through an OAuth authentication flow which may run in a main window or in a current window e.g. of a website of the airline or OTA or in a pop up window or pop up layer e.g. in response to a trigger on the website which opens such pop up.

Triggering module may generate or may present to the user one or more triggers to elicit the user to sign in to ISA and to add social information capabilities to a flight reservation web page that the user is browsing. For example a trigger for launching a sign in interface may be an explicit button or link on the airline OTA website which may read sign in with a social network to view social information of fellow passengers . Such button or link may be placed for example in a home page or a landing page of the airline OTA website thereby allowing the user to log in to social information sharing before even searching for flights. Additionally or alternatively the button or link may be placed in a search result page and optionally subsequent to user log in the airline OTA website may re render the search results to include the social information of fellow travelers. Additionally or alternatively the button or link may be placed in a seat map web page and optionally subsequent to user log in the airline OTA website may re render the seat map to include the social information of fellow travelers

Another trigger for launching a sign in interface may be a search button of a flight search interface of the airline OTA website. For example the user may fill out flight parameters e.g. flight date origin airport and destination airport and may click on a search flights button or link. In response the airline OTA website may display a search in progress page while the search is performed and such page may include the sign in interface or a link or button leading to the sign in interface for sharing and obtaining social information of fellow travelers.

Mock social widget generator may present to the user a mock social widget or a mock social network application or module as another trigger for signing in. For example a scrollable grid or list of empty images or grayed out images or blurred out images or anonymous images may be presented as a mock of a real seat map which includes real social information in order to capture the attention of a user who searches for flights. Upon hover or on click by the user on the mock item s the sign in interface may be displayed. In some implementations optionally the social widget may include incomplete social information e.g. passenger images but not passenger names passenger genders but not passenger names and complete information may be presented only upon signing in. Once the user signs in the relevant page may be re rendered to show the complete social information of fellow passengers.

Flight details page augmenter may include a module to augment a flight details page with social information of fellow passengers. For demonstrative purposes reference is made to which is a schematic illustration of a flight details page in accordance with the present invention. Flight details page may include for example an airline or carrier identifier a flight number a flight origin a flight destination flight date time information and a mock social widget showing anonymous images of passengers optionally accompanied by an invitation to sign in to see social information of fellow passengers on the flight and optionally accompanied by mock scrolling elements or other mock interface components.

Flight search results augmenter may include a module to augment a flight search results page with social information of fellow passengers. For demonstrative purposes reference is made to which is a schematic illustration of a flight search results page in accordance with the present invention. Flight search results page may include for example a search results pane having one or more flight search results items and a social widget pane showing multiple lists of passengers on each respective flight. Each list may include some passengers for example 3 or 4 or 5 passengers who consented to share their social information with fellow travelers. Passenger images in each list may be sorted for example based on social relevance to the current user e.g. based on geographic proximity gender profession age age group common interests having one or more common friends or the like . Each list may be scrollable allowing the user to scroll e.g. sideways to view additional list members. Optionally hovering over or clicking on or touching an image in each list may cause a pop up window or layer to be displayed showing additional or extended social information for the selected passenger e.g. passenger name title profession gender age marital status geographic location . For demonstrative purposes an image in list is shown in a clicked status such that an extended information panel is shown. Optionally extended information panel may include additional social information or social insights for example indicating a common interest or a common hobby or a common educational institution shared between the user and the selected fellow passenger. In a demonstrative embodiment of the present invention extended information panel may include for example social information common traits of the passenger with the current user passenger image and an indication of a flight seat allocated to that passenger. It is noted that extended information panel depicts only a few demonstrative fields and social information items which are shown for demonstrative purposes and other and or additional social information items may be presented in extended information panel for example location or residence of the user hobbies or interests of the user social buttons which may perform a social network action e.g. follow or add as a friend social links which may link to a user page or a user profile in a social network e.g. a button marked with f to link to a user s Facebook page a button marked with t to link to a user s Twitter page or the like.

Flight seat map augmenter may include a module to augment a flight seat map with social information of fellow passengers. For demonstrative purposes reference is made to which is a schematic illustration of a flight seat map incorporating therein social information of passengers in accordance with the present invention. Flight seat map may include multiple squares or other graphical elements representing seat assignment each one of squares being associated with a row number and a seat number e.g. seat A seat B or the like and may be associated with a color code or a symbol indicating whether the seat is already booked or available. A user that is signed in to ISA may be able to view flight seat map augmented with social information which may be presented in an overlay layer or a pop up panel or window optionally triggered by a hover on or mouse on or clicking or touching a particular seat. For example seat is shown with an extended information panel pertaining thereto which may be generally similar to extended information panel of . Optionally social information of passengers may be presented in other suitable ways for example as a list of passengers side by side near seat map or under or above seat map or in a separate layer or window.

Optionally flight seat map may include or may be accompanied by a social widget showing a full list or a scrollable list of images of passengers on that flight who consented to sharing their social information with fellow passengers. Each image in list may be selectable or clickable or may be hovered upon thereby causing an extended information panel e.g. similar to panel to be opened and display the extended social information for the selected passengers.

Seat map updater may be responsible for creating and updating a seat map for each particular flight the seat map being stored in seat map database . The seat map may include augmented information e.g. social information of passengers on each such particular flight information obtained from social network and or information regarding seat occupancy associated with a user related token received from airline OTA system .

Ranking module may execute a pre programmed ranking algorithm that given a current user who browses for flights or selected a flight and given a list of passengers on a flight who consented to share their social information may rank such passengers in a particular order. Ranking module may include one or more sub modules for example a social relevance score calculator a common traits identifier a weight allocator and a self learning algorithm updater .

Social relevance score calculator may calculate a social relevance score per each one of the passengers relative to the browsing user. The social relevance score may be used for one or more purposes for example for ordering of the passenger list displayed to the browsing user for suggesting a seat mate or a flight neighbor to the browsing user for suggesting to the browsing user one or more passengers as potential acquaintances or as candidates for befriending or the like.

Common traits identifier may search for and identify common traits between the browsing user and fellow passengers. A common trait may be for example attending the same high school or college or university or other educational institution working in the present or in the past for the same employer living now or in the past in the same town or city or state or country having a common age e.g. 37 or age group e.g. 36 to 40 having a common profession e.g. patent attorney or Cobol programmer having a common hobby or interest having performed a like operation to a common entity or item or other suitable traits.

Weight allocator may allocate different weights to various traits or may increase the social relevance score multiple times if the common trait repeats. For example given the current user and a passenger on the same flight the ranking algorithm may identify similar traits between the two passengers a social relevance score may be updated such that each trait holds a weight and for each common trait the relevancy score may be increased by the weight associated with that trait. For example if the two users have three common friends and the two users also attended the same university then the social relevance score may be calculated as three times the weight for a common friend plus one time the weight for a common university. Weights may differ among traits for example having a common friend may have a weight of five whereas attending the same university may have a weight of two. Other suitable weights and multipliers may be used.

Self learning algorithm updater may update or modify the ranking algorithm based on self learning or may update or modify the weights allocated to common traits by taking into account actions of the user. For example the user may select a flight seat neighboring another passenger and the ranking algorithm may compare their traits and may identify common traits. The algorithm may utilize an assumption that since the user chose to seat next to that particular passenger the common traits may be significant. Therefore the weight of these common traits may be increased with regard to this user or with regard to this user and the other particular passenger. For example the ranking algorithm may deduce that since Adam selected to seat next to Bob and their common trait is attendance in a common college then this trait may be significant to Adam and in a subsequent flight of Adam ranking of passengers may be performed by taking into account that Adam allocates a higher weight to attendance of a common college rather than for example having the same age . Similar calculations may be applied to all the users on the flight. Optionally if a user selects one flight over another flight it may be due to the social traits of people on this flight even ones that do not seat next to him. Therefore common traits with all the passengers on a flight may be increased in weight although in a smaller amount than in the case of two passengers who seat next to each other. Traits that appear in search results but were not acted upon may have their weights decreased upon each additional iteration of the ranking algorithm.

Ranking module may handle traits on two or more separate levels at a level of general traits e.g. two passengers attended the same university and at a level of instances of traits e.g. two passengers attended Harvard University . Each trait in each level may have its own weight and both weights on both levels may be taken into account when calculating the social relevancy score. Optionally more than two levels may be used for example a third level e.g. two passengers attended the Law School of Harvard University a fourth level e.g. they both attended the law school in 2005 or the like.

The calculated social relevancy score may be a number having relative significance when compared to another social relevancy score. Optionally the social relevancy score or a normalized or weighted version thereof may be displayed to the user for example the social relevance score divided by a maximum possible score may be presented to indicate to the user the level of relevancy of other passengers.

Feedback module may be used for gathering or obtaining feedback from passengers after they completed a flight e.g. the flight itself rather than the flight reservation process . After a user takes his flight feedback module may follow up with the user to obtain user feedback regarding the other passengers that the user sat with or chose to sit with. Such structured feedback may then be used in the calculation of social relevance score or match scores with other users. Furthermore feedback module may allow a user to provide feedback on his own preferences as to the passengers he seats next to and may take such feedback into account. For example if the feedback from one or more users is that passenger Adam is good at keeping a business conversation and user Bob states that he is interested in business conversation then the match score between these two users may be increased. The feedback that a first user may provide on a second user may further refer to the way that the second user behaved during the flight for example indicating that the second user was talking excessively was noisy was snoring was friendly was unfriendly had a positive or negative level of hygiene or odor or the like.

Matching module may provide to a prospective passenger recommendations for matched passengers on his flight e.g. showing to the user the social information of fellow passengers that may interest you or fellow passengers that may be the most interesting for you . Identification of matching users may be based on the social relevance score. For example after calculating the social relevance score of all the users on a flight a matching algorithm may choose and may display to the user the passengers having the top 3 or 5 or other suitable number of social relevance score or the passengers having the top 10 of other percentile of the social relevance score. Optionally users may be matched and displayed based on their connection levels for example direct friends friends of friends or second degree friends third degree friends people with multiple common traits or interests people with a single common trait or interest or other suitable levels of matching.

It is noted that feedback module may be able to operate bi directionally and may be able to send notifications to a passenger with regard to changes in the seat map of his flight. In a first example Adam may select seat D in a flight next to seat E which may be already occupied by Bob and next to seat C which may remain available. Subsequently seat C may be occupied e.g. reserved by Charles and feedback module may send a notification to Adam to alert him that seat C next to his seat D changed from available to occupied and augmenting such notification with the social information of Charles as obtained from social network . Similarly Bob may change his seat selection and a similar notification may be sent to Adam to alert Adam to the change in occupancy of seat E the notification including social information of the departing neighbor and or of a new neighbor that took his place. In another example Adam may request to receive hourly daily or weekly updates with regard to seat selection or seat selection modification in the entire flight and or in particular regions of the seat map the notification including social information of new passengers or of passengers who changed their selected seat s . Notifications may be delivered to passengers by electronic mail by text messages or SMS messages by voice messages e.g. using a text to speech converter or by other suitable ways.

Statistics module may perform statistical analysis on data including seat assignment and or social information associated with passengers on a particular flight or on a batch or set of flights e.g. all the instances of flight number in a particular week or month or all flights from Boston to Los Angeles in a particular day or week and may generate statistical insights and or statistical results e.g. demographic insights which may be reported to an airline or an OTA using reporting module . For example reporting module may allow an airline OTA to obtain demographic insights which may be shown as text numbers pie charts graphs or other suitable reporting elements or comparison elements. In a first example reporting module may report to airline OTA that on a monthly basis 78 percent of passengers from Boston to Miami are 60 years old or older and the airline OTA may utilize such insight for example for targeted advertising in magazines that cater to senior citizens in the Boston area. In a second example reporting module may report to airline OTA that in a certain month 68 percent of passengers on a particular flight e.g. morning flight from Dallas to Newark are females or that 55 percent of passengers in general are from a particular industry e.g. the legal industry or the medical industry and such insights may again be used for targeted marketing campaigns or for other suitable purposes.

Social information merger may allow ISA to receive social information from multiple social networks may merge or unify them and may provide the aggregated information in a uniform or normalized manner. Social information merger may utilize social network precedence rule s to resolve conflicts between social information obtained from two or more social networks. For example a user may be connected to several social networks as some parts of the social information about the user may be obtained from multiple social networks. When this information is singular or unique for example the user name or gender or age the information from several networks may be different and may present a conflict. ISA may resolve this by ordering the social networks and giving precedence to the data received from higher social networks based on pre defined rule s . In a demonstrative example a set of rules may be that LinkedIn social information prevails over Facebook social information that LinkedIn social information prevails over Google Plus social information and that Facebook social information prevails over Google Plus social information. Optionally the rules may be available for the user to inspect review and or modify and the user may optionally be able to delete rules add rules or modify rules e.g. a particular user may decide that Facebook information prevails over all other social networks information .

Privacy module may ensure that privacy settings of users are respected such that ISA may not present more information than social network allows according to the user s privacy settings at social network . However ISA may allow the user to narrow down the list of people who may view his social information on the context of ISA for example by defining user groups according to the social network semantics e.g. Facebook friends LinkedIn First Degree Contacts or the like . The user may then define which groups may or may not see his social information in a flight related context. The configuration may be set for the entirety of the user s social information according to a network specific group of users e.g. as defined using a social network specific terminology for example a group of friends on Facebook a group of contacts on LinkedIn .

ISA may connect between users in different social networks. ISA may allow users to see each other based on their privacy settings and may allow a user who is logged in with a first social network e.g. Facebook to see also users from a second social network e.g. LinkedIn as long as all such users consented to share their social information for flight related purposes. Optionally this may be allowed when the social network privacy settings of a user allow anonymous users to see the social information of that user on that social network and or when the relevant policies or settings of the social network permit sharing of social information with users who are not members of that social network and or with users who are not logged in into the social network.

ISA may allow the user to provide information about himself on top of the information retrieved from social networks for example by presenting the user a form in which he can fill in information about himself. This form may be presented immediately after signing into ISA with a particular social network and or by accessing the ISA user profile page and entering the details there. According to the social network s policy the form may be pre populated with details that the user provided in the social network. In the form the user may override details that he provided on the social network and may also add details that he did not provide in the social network. The information that the user entered in this form may be displayed as part of the user s shared social information similar to other social network information. Since the details entered in this form may differ from the details entered by the user in social networks ISA may use the network precedence mechanism or rules as described above to resolve possible conflicts. For example data entered in the ISA user information form may be treated as data obtained from an external social network and its precedence may be predetermined e.g. it may prevail over any other social network or may be configured by the user.

ISA may further allow sharing of information among two more airline websites or two more OTA websites or a combination of airline website s and OTA website s . For example some airlines may share flights between themselves e.g. known as code sharing and with OTAs and thus ISA may provide a way for such multiple clients to access and update the seating data on mutual flights. Since flight tickets may be sold in parallel by multiple clients ISA may allow placement of logged in users on a flight even if it was done by different clients or entities or websites. For example some users on a flight may purchase the tickets on the airline s website e.g. United.com whereas some users may purchase the tickets for the same flight on a first OTA website e.g. Expedia.com and whereas additional users may purchase the tickets for the same flight on another OTA website e.g. Orbitz.com . Still all these passengers may be able to see each other s images and social information based on their privacy settings.

Optionally ISA may be associated with or may include search Application Programming Interface API which may receive an input an airline or carrier identifier a flight number identifier and a date in which the flight is scheduled. Search API may provide output including for example social information and images of passengers on that flight. ISA may further utilize a service e.g. third party service to obtain a list of flights and to allow users to choose seats in flights. Any permitted client application may utilize the search API to get the flight object and to apply to it the seating social information. The carrier and flight number may differ in the case of airline code sharing and thus ISA may utilize a mapping or a lookup table or conversion table of code sharing information.

ISA may allow social information enhancements for example may allow a client to add social information to objects other than flights. For example ISA may be used for adding social information for hotel reservation options e.g. in an airline website an OTA website or a hotel booking website . A logged in user on an airline website may be presented with a social widget similar to the flight seating social widget at the area of the website dedicated for hotel reservation notifying the user about other users who chose to book a hotel through the website. Similarly ISA or a similar social information module or application may be used to show to a user the social information and images of other users who joined the frequent flier program of users who rented a car through the airline or OTA website of users who upgraded from coach to business class or the like. ISA may achieve this by leveraging a container model utilized for flight social information in which ISA regards each particular flight as a container of seated users. A similar model may apply to other object s in an airline or OTA website. For example ISA may treat the hotel reservation option as a container of users who book rooms in a particular hotel for a particular date. The container may be initiated by the airline or OTA website and may be populated by users who make their hotel reservation through such website. Once a new logged in user views this section he may view this information in the same way he would view the social information of other passengers in a flight.

In some embodiments of the present invention social information corresponding to two or more passengers of a particular flight may be obtained in bulk or as a batch by utilizing a single query rather than by using multiple queries which identifies the flight e.g. identifying the airline a flight number and a flight date . The query may not identify by his real name or by other real life identifier e.g. passport number or even by a virtual name e.g. a social network nickname or username any passenger s on said flight. The social information may be obtained in bulk from a source external to an airline OTA system or website rather than by building or creating from the ground up within the airline OTA system a list of passengers on a flight while associating between a real life name and a social network nickname of each passenger.

Although portions of the discussion herein may relate for demonstrative purposes to sharing of social information among users who book a flight on an airplane the present invention may be utilized in conjunction with other industries or applications for example sharing of social information among users who book a cruise on a boat e.g. on Carnival Cruise sharing of social information among users who book a hotel reservation e.g. on Hilton or at a vacation resort e.g. Club Med sharing of social information among users who book a vehicular trip e.g. Greyhound or a train grip e.g. Amtrac sharing of social information among users who book a reservation or purchase ticket s for a sporting event or a theater show or a movie sharing of social information among users who reserve a place at a restaurant or bar or the like.
