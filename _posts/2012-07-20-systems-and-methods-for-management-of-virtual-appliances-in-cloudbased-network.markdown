This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 128 233 filed on May 28 2008 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present teachings relate to management of virtual appliances in a cloud based network and more particularly to platforms and techniques for establishing a cloud based virtual appliance monitor to manage virtual appliances instantiated in a cloud.

Software appliances generally involve the encapsulation of a pre defined application or applications with a reduced version of an operating system OS such as the Linux operating system. Software appliances in one regard thereby represent a relatively compact ready to install application solution and can be distributed via media such as CD ROM discs or downloaded for installation. Software appliances can be distributed and installed in a variety of environments including stand alone and networked environments. A population of software appliances can be managed on a network from a centralized monitor or host including to track the software provisioning user authorizations execution states and other attributes of the deployed appliances.

In cases however a network administrator may wish to set up a set of software appliances specifically in a network cloud environment. In general a cloud based architecture deploys a set of hosted resources such as processors operating systems software and other components that can be combined or strung together to form virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of machines from those resources from a central server or management system to perform intended tasks or applications. For example a user may wish to set up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis. The user can lease or subscribe to the set of resources needed to build and run the set of instantiated virtual machines on a comparatively short term basis such as hours or days for their intended application. The advent of cloud based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores media outlets and other online sites or services.

In the context of a set of virtual appliances that are instantiated in a cloud environment issues in the configuration and deployment of the appliances can arise. For instance while on premise appliance monitors are known for the implementation of hardware based appliance installations in the case of virtual appliances a user may not have access to an on premise server or other platform to execute appliance monitoring and control. Even if the user had access to a regular appliance monitor platform that platform typically would be configured to connect to physical instances of the set of appliances as opposed to transient virtual appliances executing in the cloud. It may be desirable to provide methods and systems for the management of cloud based virtual appliances that themselves can be supported by the cloud as opposed to requiring on premise infrastructure.

Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for management of virtual appliances in cloud based network. More particularly embodiments relate to a network cloud environment in which a set of virtual appliances can be instantiated as one type of virtual machine or resource. In addition to populating the virtual appliances in the cloud in embodiments a virtual appliance monitor can also be instantiated in the cloud. The virtual appliance monitor can communicate with the set of virtual appliances and monitor those virtual appliances to detect monitor and update the provisioning configuration and execution state of the appliances. For example the set of instantiated virtual appliances can be monitored to update installed applications software or other license management to detect malicious software to manage user registrations meter and record subscription charges and other supervisory network tasks. The virtual appliance monitor can in embodiments store data reflecting the state of the virtual appliances to a permanent data store external to the cloud. In embodiments the image of the virtual appliance monitor can be migrated from a hardware installation performing the same or similar tasks which functions can then be supported in the cloud. These and other embodiments described herein address the various noted shortcomings in known appliance management technology and provide a user or network operator with enhanced capabilities including the configuration or migration of appliance management infrastructure to the cloud.

Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Where possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

Embodiments described herein can be implemented in or supported by a cloud network architecture. As used herein a cloud can comprise a collection of resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine process or other resource for a limited or defined duration. As shown for example in the collection of resources supporting a cloud can comprise a set of resource servers configured to deliver computing components needed to instantiate a virtual machine process or other resource. For example one group of resource servers can host and serve an operating system or components thereof to deliver to and instantiate a virtual machine. Another group of resource servers can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time to supply a defined level of processing power for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers can host and serve applications to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine such as an email client a browser application a messaging application or other applications or software. Other types of resource servers are possible.

In embodiments the entire set of resource servers or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud along with its instantiated virtual machines is managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and or other software hardware and network tools that communicate via network such as the Internet or other public or private network with all sets of resource servers to manage the cloud and its operation. To instantiate a new set of virtual machines a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system for the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email messaging or other applications from the cloud . The request can be received and processed by the cloud management system which identifies the type of virtual machine process or other resource being requested. The cloud management system can then identify the collection of resources necessary to instantiate that machine or resource. In embodiments the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can for example comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts or other transaction sites.

In embodiments the user s instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request for example can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated machine or process is needed. The period of time can be for example an hour a day or other increment of time. In embodiments the user s instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance a user could request resources until a software update is completed. The user s instantiation request can specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example the request can specify an amount of processing power or input output I O throughput the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement SLA acceptable for their application. Other parameters and settings can be used. One skilled in the art will realize that the user s request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters and others.

When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build that machine or resource have been identified the cloud management system can communicate with one or more set of resource servers to locate resources to supply the required components. The cloud management system can select providers from the diverse set of resource servers to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the set of resource servers available to the cloud management system since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments other hardware software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example other software services that are provided outside of the cloud and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in cloud virtual machines. For further example other non cloud hardware and or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the cloud either on an on demand or subscribed or decided basis.

With the resource requirements identified the cloud management system can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic or on demand basis. For example one set of resource servers may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further set of resource servers can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth for example on a guaranteed minimum or best efforts basis. In other embodiments the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example a set of resource servers may respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time such as the next 12 hours.

The cloud management system can select group of servers in the set of resource servers that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the virtual machine or other resource. The cloud management system can then coordinate the integration of the completed group of servers from the set of resource servers to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system can track the combined group of servers selected from the set of resource servers or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population or other resources.

In embodiments the cloud management system can generate a resource aggregation table that identifies the various sets of resource servers that will be used to supply the components of the virtual machine or process. The sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as for instance Internet protocol IP addresses or other addresses. The cloud management system can register the finalized group of servers in the set resource servers contributing to an instantiated machine or process.

The cloud management system can then set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines processes or other resources to be delivered from the cloud. The cloud management system can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in set of resource servers . The cloud management system can receive a confirmation message back from each participating server in set of resource servers indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various sets of resource servers may confirm for example the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles amounts of electronic memory communications bandwidth or applications or other software prepared to be served.

As shown for example in the cloud management system can then instantiate one or more than one set of virtual machines or other processes based on the resources supplied by the registered set of resource servers . In embodiments the cloud management system can instantiate a given number for example 10 500 1000 or other numbers of virtual machines to be made available to users on one or more networks such as the Internet or other public or private network. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table or other record or image of the instantiated population. Additionally the cloud management system can store the duration of each virtual machine and the collection of resources utilized by the complete set of instantiated virtual machines .

In embodiments the cloud management system can further store track and manage a user s identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software hardware and other resources. Each user that populates a set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system can track and configure specific actions that a user can perform such as provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking billing and auditing of the services consumed by the user. In embodiments the cloud management system can for example meter the usage and or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines to generate subscription billing records for a user that has launched those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.

The cloud management system can configure each virtual machine to be made available to users of the one or more networks via a browser interface or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine can communicate with the cloud management system and the underlying registered set of resource servers via a standard Web application programming interface API or via other calls or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines can likewise communicate with each other as well as other sites servers locations and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks whether within a given cloud or between clouds.

It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines from a client or terminal the processing memory communications storage and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the cloud . In embodiments the set of virtual machines or other resources may not depend on or require the user s own on premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off premise basis for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.

Because the cloud management system in one regard specifies builds operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines on a logical level the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real time or near real time basis without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The user s set of instantiated machines processes or other resources can be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on demand basis if desired. In embodiments the various sets of resource servers that are accessed by the cloud management system to support a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes can change or be substituted over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.

In terms of network management of the set of virtual machines that have been successfully configured and instantiated the cloud management system can perform various network management tasks including security maintenance and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system of a given cloud can for example install or terminate applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system can monitor operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines and for instance terminate the infected application or virtual machine. The cloud management system can likewise manage an entire set of instantiated clients or other resources on a collective basis for instance to push or delivery a software upgrade to all active virtual machines. Other management processes are possible.

In embodiments more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same overlapping or successive times. The cloud management system can in such implementations build launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers with populations of different instantiated virtual machines such as may be requested by different users. The cloud management system can institute and enforce security protocols in a cloud hosting multiple sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines can be hosted in a respective partition or sub cloud of the resources of the main cloud . The cloud management system of a cloud can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub clouds or isolate individual workloads processes within the cloud to a specific sub cloud. The subdivision of the cloud into distinct transient sub clouds or other sub components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple user scenario each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the overall cloud system. In further embodiments sub clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources if desired.

In embodiments and as also shown in the set of instantiated virtual machines generated in a first cloud can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes generated in a second third or further cloud . The cloud management system of a first cloud can interface with the cloud management system of a second cloud to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and or virtual machines or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system of a given cloud can track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that network cloud as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.

In the foregoing and other embodiments the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person customer subscriber administrator corporation organization or other entity. In embodiments the user can be or include another virtual machine application or process. In further embodiments multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.

The set of virtual appliances communicates with a virtual appliance monitor configured to monitor and manage the set of virtual appliances . Virtual appliance monitor can be instantiated in cloud by cloud management system . Virtual appliance monitor can communicate appliance state data to or from any of the appliances in set of virtual appliances .

In embodiments any one or more of the virtual appliances in set of virtual appliances can also or instead transmit or push appliance state data to virtual appliance monitor at regular periods or based on events or other criteria.

Virtual appliance monitor can receive appliance state data and perform monitoring and management of the set of virtual appliances . Virtual appliance monitor can for instance register and manage the software license or other entitlement status of the set of virtual appliances . Virtual appliance monitor can similarly manage the relationship between the set of virtual appliances and networks to which those appliances or their users are registered or subscribed such as Red Hat Network maintained by Red Hat Inc. of Raleigh N.C. or others. Virtual appliance monitor can also for example detect fault conditions in the set of applications or other software operating in the set of virtual appliances . In embodiments virtual appliance monitor can terminate or suspend faulted applications or other software. For further example virtual appliance monitor can detect the signature of a virus or other malicious process and for instance terminate any appliance identified to be affected by such infections. For yet further example virtual appliance monitor can manage the set of applications installed in set of virtual appliances and for example perform updates to versions of applications or other software provisioned to the set of virtual appliances . Virtual appliance monitor can still further manage user identity account and access privileges to the set of virtual appliances . Virtual appliance monitor can perform one or more control actions in response to conditions detected in appliance state data or otherwise for instance by issuing commands or instructions via network to one or more appliances in set of virtual appliances . Other management and administrative functions can be performed by virtual appliance monitor . In embodiments appliance management functions and protocols such as those described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 128 768 filed May 29 2008 entitled Systems and Methods for Identification and Management of Cloud Based Virtual Machines which application is incorporated herein by reference can also be used.

In embodiments virtual appliance monitor can store appliance state data and other information associated with set of virtual appliances in an appliance state table . Appliance state table can contain a virtual appliance ID field and a set of appliance state fields reflecting the execution state configuration state input output state or other information associated with set of virtual appliances . In embodiments appliance state table can be stored to external appliance store . In embodiments appliance state table can be built and populated without being committed to permanent storage.

In embodiments virtual appliance monitor can store information related to set of virtual appliances including appliance state data and a history or log of control actions to an external appliance store located outside cloud . External appliance store can be or include for example an on premise database operated by the user or operator of set of virtual appliances . In embodiments as shown virtual appliance monitor can itself be instantiated and managed by cloud management system using management engine cloud store and other resources to track and support the virtual appliance monitor . Virtual appliance monitor can for example be built instantiated and operated on a subscription or usage basis for which cloud management system records the execution time duration input output bandwidth or other operating parameters of virtual appliance monitor to accrue subscription charges or otherwise account for the use of virtual appliance monitor . In embodiments when the subscription period for set of virtual appliances and or virtual appliance monitor has expired or other termination events take place cloud management system can deactivate or terminate set of virtual appliances and or virtual appliance monitor as appropriate. It may be noted that in embodiments set of virtual appliances can interact with other appliances or other types of virtual machines or resources both inside the cloud in which set of virtual appliances were instantiated as well as outside cloud .

In step one or more appliance control action s can be generated by virtual appliance monitor based on appliance state data and or other information.

External appliance store can be a database or other storage facility located outside of or external to cloud . In step cloud management system can record usage information for virtual appliance monitor to cloud store as appropriate. For instance for users or operators who employ virtual appliance monitor on a subscription basis the time usage bandwidth usage or other metering of the usage of virtual appliance monitor can be recorded to accrue subscription charges or for other purposes.

In step the set of virtual appliances and or virtual appliance monitor can be deactivated or terminated upon the expiration of a subscription period or based upon other termination criteria. In step as understood by persons skilled in the art processing can repeat return to a prior processing point jump to a further processing point or end.

The foregoing description is illustrative and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example while embodiments have been described in which a set of virtual appliances are instantiated for use in one network cloud in embodiments the one or more sets of virtual appliances can be instantiated in multiple clouds. For further example while embodiments have been described in which a single appliance monitor supervises the execution state of a set of virtual appliances in embodiments multiple virtual appliance monitors can cooperate to manage one or more sets of virtual appliances. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined. The scope of the present teachings is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims.
