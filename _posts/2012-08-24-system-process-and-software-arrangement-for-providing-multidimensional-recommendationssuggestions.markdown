title: System, process and software arrangement for providing multidimensional recommendations/suggestions
abstract: A process, system and computer software are provided to facilitate at least one recommendation to one or more users and/or one or more applications using multidimensional data. In particular, a multidimensional space is defined, wherein each dimension is capable of providing variable information. At least one dimension corresponds to user profiles. The multidimensional space is filled with multidimensional data corresponding to dimensions of the multidimensional space. Then, information from the multidimensional space is retrieved. Further, the recommendation is generated based on the retrieved information. In addition, it is possible to generate a recommendation-specific query. This can be performed by generating the recommendation-specific query to access a multidimensional cube and retrieve data stored therein. Then, the recommendation can be issued based on the data retrieved from the multidimensional cube.

The present invention relates to a system process and software arrangement for providing multidimensional recommendations suggestions and more particularly to utilizing multiple dimensions along with comprehensive profiling and hierarchical aggregation in a recommendation model.

Recommendation systems have recently become important components of numerous computer applications e.g. in the e commerce space. In particular such systems enable a receipt of feedback from company s customers. Based on their customer s feedback the companies can better serve their customers by providing recommendations and suggestion thereto. Because the customers generally appreciate receiving informative and pertinent recommendations and suggestions from the companies that they deal with such interaction between the customers and companies allow these companies which utilize the recommendation systems to establish and further develop long lasting personalized relationships with their customers.

Research and development of systems and processes which provide recommendations and suggestions to users on a personal basis e.g. via e mail the Web and mobile communication devices has been significant in the past. Primarily however large portion of such research and development has concentrated on simple recommendations of items to the users or vice versa. For example a conventional recommendation system and process may provide a particular recommendation of a certain brand of a plasma television to a user based on the user s previous transactions and or entries of preferences. Also the users who have previously shown interest in the plasma televisions can be forwarded to a particular brand of the plasma television based on the characteristics of such television. Other exemplary applications of the conventional systems and processes provide e.g. movies to site visitors and vise versa book customers to books or vice versa etc. These conventional recommendation systems and processes are usually based on known two dimensional collaborative filtering techniques content based filtering techniques or a combination of both.

Exemplary collaborative filtering techniques are described in J. S. Breese et al. Empherical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering Technical Report MSR TR 98 12 Microsoft Research May 1998 W. Hill et al. Recommending and Evaluating Choices in a Virtual Community of Use Proceedings of CHI 95 Conference Denver Colo. 1995 pp. 194 201 and U. Shardanand et al. Social Information Filtering Algorithms for Automating Word of Mouth Proceedings of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems CHI 95 ACM Press 1995 pp. 210 217. Content based filtering techniques are described in the Breese publication F. R. J. Mooney et al Book Recommending using Text Categorization with Extracted Information Recommender Systems Papers from 1998 Workshop Tech. Report WS 98 08 AAAI Press 1998 and M. Pazzani et al. Syskill Webert Identifying Interesting Web Sites Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence 1996. Techniques that combine the corraborative filtering and content based techniques are described in A. Ansari et al. Internet Recommendations Systems Journal of Marketing Research August 2000 pp. 363 375 M. Balabanovic et al. Fab Content based Collaborative Recommendation Communications of the ACM 40 3 66 72 1997 and M. Pazzani et al. A Framework for Collaborative Content based and Demographic Filtering Artificial Intelligence Review December 1999 pp. 393 408. However in numerous applications e.g. recommending vacation packages restaurants or Web content to customers it may not be sufficient to recommend particular items to certain users or to suggest the users to the particular items.

For example certain customer s preferences for vacation packages may be dependent on the current time of the year or the time of the year that the vacation package is being offered. This is because such customer may prefer to vacation in the Caribbean in the winter but not in the summer or that the Caribbean vacation is only being offered at a low rate in the summer. In addition for certain applications and situations it may not be beneficial or appropriate to recommend individual items to individual users but instead provide certain categories of items to particular types of users. One example of such recommendation facilitation may be providing movies which fit into a category of action movies to college students. Moreover while some of the existing recommendation systems support limited profiles of the users and items it is preferable to utilize more extensive profiling capabilities such as the ones described in G. Adomavicius et al. Expert driven Validation of Rule based User Models in Personalization Applications Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 5 1 2 33 58 2001.

The traditional two dimensional recommendation systems and processes also provide the recommendations of at most two types by e.g. providing top N items to the user or top M users to the item. Further these types of recommendations are typically pre fixed into the recommendation software system by a company providing the software system without being able to dynamically change the predefined recommendation types. However in many multi dimensional applications it is exactly what would be necessary to be able to provide more extensive and flexible types of recommendations to be requested by the user. For example it may be preferable to recommend top three action movies that are not longer than 2 hours to individual users and to limit providing such movie recommendations to only those users whose favorite movie type list includes action movies.

Therefore it is one of the objects of the present invention to provide an ability to support and utilize multiple dimensions for generating recommendations and suggestions such the multiple dimension can include users items time place etc. Another object of the present invention is to support aggregation hierarchies for various dimensions and provide recommendation capabilities at different levels of aggregation. Yet another object of the present invention is to support extensive profiling capabilities in multi dimensional recommendation systems and processes.

In order to provide the above described recommendation capabilities a recommendation query language RQL can be provided to allow the users to obtain complex and flexible recommendations that may take into consideration multiple dimensions aggregation hierarchies and extensive profiling. The proposed approach can be based on e.g. a data warehouse paradigm as described in S. Chaudhuri et al. An Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP Technology ACM SIGMOD Record 26 1 65 74 1997 and R. Kimball The Data Warehouse Toolkit John Wiley Sons Inc. 1996.

Still another object of the present invention is to combine the above described features of the present invention as components of an integrated multi dimensional recommendation model based on the data warehouse paradigm. Such integrated model supports multiple dimensions and the hierarchies of the data warehouse facilitate certain recommendation capabilities at multiple aggregation levels e.g. On Line Analytical Processing OLAP enabled data warehousing systems .

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a language for the user s to express complex and extensive recommendations in a flexible manner.

Various embodiments of a process and system according to the present invention overcome the above described deficiencies of the conventional recommendation systems and processes.

In particular a process system and software arrangement according to the present invention are provided to provide multi dimensional recommendations. A process system and computer software are provided to facilitate at least one recommendation to one or more users and or one or more applications using multidimensional data. In particular the multidimensional data defining a multidimensional space is accessed. The multidimensional space can consist of more than two dimensions unlike the current recommendation systems that can handle only two dimensions each capable of providing variable information. Then information from the multidimensional space is retrieved. Further the recommendation is generated based on the retrieved information.

In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention the recommendation includes multidimensional suggestions which can be based on multiple factors associated with the at least one of the users and the applications. In addition the retrieved information can include manually entered ratings previously generated by the users and or the applications for goods services and or information. The recommendation may provide further data which relates to the goods the services and or the particular information.

The manually entered ratings can be provided by the one or more users. In addition prior to the information being retrieved the multidimensional space can be filled with the manually entered ratings. After the multidimensional space is filled and if the multidimensional space is not substantially or fully filled with the manually entered ratings estimated ratings can automatically be generated based on the manually entered ratings. Further after automatically generating the estimated ratings it is possible to fill at least one unfilled portion of the multidimensional space with the automatically generated ratings. The automatically generated ratings may relate to the goods the services and or the particular information and the multidimensional space can represent a set of all ratings for all possible goods services and or information.

In still another embodiment of the present invention at least one of the dimensions may have a hierarchy or profiles. The profiles may have static characteristics and can include factual information consisting of certain facts regarding the respective dimension. Each of the static profiles can be recorded in a data storage arrangement as one record per each dimension. The profiles may also have dynamic characteristics which can include at least one set of rules. The dynamic profiles may also contain include at least one set of sequences.

According to yet another embodiment of the present invention the recommendation can be provided to the users and or applications for a particular category of the goods services and or particular information. At least one of the dimensions may have a hierarchy associated with its elements the retrieved information can include manually entered ratings and if the multidimensional space is not filled with the manually entered ratings aggregate ratings can be calculated based on the hierarchy.

In a further embodiment of the present invention prior to the recommendation being generated a recommendation technique can be dynamically selected from a set of techniques to generate the recommendation. Also the recommendation can be generated by issuing a recommendation request type query which is translatable into a Structured Query Language SQL query. Further the multidimensional space may be represented as a multidimensional cube which stores the information to be retrieved therein.

In addition according to yet another embodiment of the present invention it is possible to generate a recommendation specific query. This can be performed by accessing a multidimensional cube which stores data therein and then generating such recommendation specific query to obtain at least one recommendation from the multidimensional cube based on the data thereof. The recommendation specific query is preferably translatable into the SQL query.

Unless otherwise defined all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same or substantially similar meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. Although processes systems and software arrangements similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention exemplary processes systems and software arrangements are described below in further detail. In addition the systems processes software arrangements and examples are provided for the purposes of illustration only and are in no way limiting. All cited references are incorporated herein by reference.

For a better understanding of the present invention together with other and further objects reference is made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and its scope will be pointed out in the appended claims.

The information products and or services may include shopping tips and information movie suggestions items to be purchased etc. Thus when the entities access the web arrangement they may request and the web arrangement can provide the information products and or services. In addition the web arrangement may forward recommendation and or suggestions for the products and or services or the categories thereof that the web arrangement may have obtained for the entities from other sources. As indicated above the web arrangement may be connected to a processing arrangement e.g. a personal computer a mini computer a mainframe or a combination plurality of each either via directly or via the communication network . The processing arrangement is preferably the device which generates the recommendations and or suggestions to the web arrangement and or the entities. The web arrangement can provide the data received from the entities regarding the entities characteristics profiles ratings etc. to the processing arrangement which can be used to generate recommendations and or suggestions for the entities and or other users and systems. It is also within the scope of the present invention to provide the data to the processing arrangement from sources other than or in addition to those described herein. Indeed the recommendation generation of the processing arrangement does not depend the source of the data. After these recommendations suggestions are received by the web arrangement from the processing arrangement they can preferably be transmitted by the web arrangement to the entities or other users systems. Alternatively or in addition the processing arrangement can forward the recommendations suggestions directly to the entities or other users systems upon the generation of the recommendations suggestions by the processing arrangement .

The entities may be individuals and business entities connecting to the web arrangement the processing arrangement and or the communication arrangement through their respective computing and communications devices. In addition external application may be able to gain access to the web arrangement and or the processing arrangement either directly or via the communication network . These entities and applications may avail themselves to the recommendations and or suggestions issued by the processing arrangement as well as providing certain data thereto e.g. the individual s preferences and or ratings for a particular product service type of product service or group thereof.

This processing arrangement can access the data from and provide new received and or generated data to an internal data storage source e.g. a CD ROM hard drive etc. or to an external data storage arrangement e.g. data tapes disk array database collection of databases etc. either directly or via the communication arrangement . Such data can preferably be recommendation data generated by the processing arrangement and may also include the profiles of the individual the business entity and the external application . It should be understood that the individual can be a person or a group of people receiving recommendations as well as being the source of the profiling information. In general they can be different. In another embodiment of the present invention the external data storage arrangement can record thereon preferences provided by the individuals and or business entities regarding the types of products and or services which interest them as well as the information regarding the particulars of the transactions previously performed thereby. Furthermore the processing arrangement preferably accesses its internal storage device or and or the external storage arrangement to gain access to the data from a multi dimensional data store which is recorded thereon. Using the information obtained from the multi dimensional data store the processing arrangement can generate and forward to the web arrangement the individuals business entities and or external applications particular recommendations which are relevant to the entities applications and or other users. As mentioned above the processing arrangement of the present invention is able to utilize aggregation hierarchies and extensive profiling information which can be stored on the multi dimensional data store for generating the above described recommendations and or suggestions.

In operation upon receipt of the data at the communication port from the individuals business entities external applications web arrangement and or other systems such data can be forwarded via e.g. a bus to a display device of the processing arrangement to be displayed thereon and or to a storage device of the processing arrangement to be stored thereon. The display device can be a monitor a liquid crystal display a printer and the like. The storage arrangement can include read only memory random access memory hard drive floppy disk drive compact disk Read Write device etc. The processing arrangement can also include an input device such as a keyboard pen based arrangement voice recognition system etc. which would allow the operator of the processing arrangement to enter information thereon enter queries and or select certain configuration and settings thereby sending a signal to the processing device via the bus to perform the requested procedure query and or to establish the entered configuration and settings for the processing arrangement .

In particular the recommendation processing arrangement can utilize the processing device to process the data received via the communication port the information entered using the input device along with the data retrieved from the relational database management system which can store data regarding previous recommendations suggestions and other user related information on the storage device and or the data storage arrangement . In addition the recommendation processing arrangement can forward the recommendations to entities and or web arrangement as described above.

As shall be described in further detail below the RQL processing arrangement may process query requests generated by the entities external applications web arrangement systems and the like. These queries can prompt the processing device of the processing arrangement to access the relational database management system so as to obtain ratings previous recommendations and other information which may be relevant to the entities applications and or other systems issuing the query. Then the retrieved data can be provided to the recommendation processing arrangement which uses the processing device to generate the recommendations and or suggestions to the entities applications and or other systems or other individuals or entities for which the recommendations suggestions may be pertinent. As described above these recommendations suggestions can then be transmitted to the entities and or external applications directly by the processing arrangement or via the web arrangement may be stored on the data storage arrangement in a manner described in further details below and or possibly displayed on the display device of the processing arrangement .

Conventional collaborative content based and hybrid recommendation systems generally operate with applications which have only two types of entities e.g. users and items users and movies users and Web pages etc. It should be understood that the term users is not limited to people persons individuals and can include computers robots software agents etc. In order to provide recommendations an initial set of ratings specifying how the users may have appreciated certain items can be explicitly specified by the users or implicitly inferred by such conventional system. The prior art recommendation systems have generally utilized ratings which were previously assigned to the items by the users to generate the recommendations. For example when a user John Doe accesses a website in which he would be requested to rate a particular movie Mr. Doe may assign a particular rating to such movie e.g. a rating of 7 out of 13 for one or more movies e.g. the movie Gladiator . Thus a rating set for Mr. Doe can be established as R John Doe Gladiator 7. Based on these initial ratings a prior art recommendation system may attempt to make a determination of the ratings of the items which have not yet been rated by the users. This can be done by estimating the rating function R Users ItemsRatings 1 for the user item pairs which have not yet been rated. Using the conventional two dimensional recommendation systems the above described rating function 1 can be implemented as a matrix that specifies the rating R i j of item j by user i.

The estimation of unknown ratings can be performed using different methods the details of which are known by those having ordinary skill in the art and described in the publications pointed to herein above. shows an exemplary diagram in which content based collaborative filtering approaches as well as a hybrid thereof are utilized by the system process and software arrangement according to the present invention for providing recommendations and or suggestions. In particular when utilized for the users items example the collaborative technique can fill in a ratings diagram i.e. users vs. items matrix by estimating a rating r u i which can preferably be performed by locating n users u who are similar to users u and by estimating rating r u i as a function f r u i r u i . . . r u i where f can be any extrapolation function known to a person having ordinary skill in the art e.g. an averaging function . The similarity distance between users can be computed with the techniques known to persons with ordinary skills in the art e.g. as a correlation coefficient between two rating vectors.

When the content based technique is utilized the ratings matrix users items can be filled by estimating rating r u i which may be performed by locating n items i . . . i which are similar to item i such that ratings r u i exist e.g. were manually specified by user u and by estimating the ratings r u i vector as a function f r u i r u i . . . r u i . The function f can be any extrapolation function known to a person having ordinary skill in the art such as e.g. a cosine similarity measure extensively used in information retrieval. According to the present invention it may be preferable to estimate the ratings r u i vector by 

In one exemplary embodiment of the above described distance computation technique according to the present invention a Euclidean or weighted Euclidean distance between the vectors can be estimated or determined. In particular let x x x . . . x and y y y . . . y be two vectors in a k dimensional space and assume that each dimension i has a weight wassigned thereto e.g. which specifies the importance of this dimension . For example for a 3 dimensional space having dimensions Customer Items Time x John Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone Jan. 12 2002 i.e. John bought Harry Potter s book on Jan. 12 2001. Thus the distance between the two vectors x and y can be defined as square root over 2 where wspecifies the weight or importance of the i th dimension with the sum of weights being 1 w 1. It should be understood that other techniques than the above described technique can be used to calculate the distance between the rating vectors which are within the scope of the present invention.

As described in further detail above certain applications e.g. travel recommendation and services applications restaurant systems and dynamic Web content presentation systems cannot be consolidated well into the conventional two dimensional user item approach since they require extra dimensions such as time to model their inherent additional complexities. Provided below are the details of the system process and software arrangement which utilizes multidimensional data to issue recommendations and or suggestions.

Accordingly the system process and software arrangement extends the conventional two dimensional data utilization technique to multiple dimensions of data e.g. recommendations ratings users items date time location etc. . In particular given dimensions D D . . . D a recommendation space can be define to be S D D . . . D. Ratings can be defined as a rating domain representing the set of all possible rating values. Thus the rating function R is defined as 12Ratings 3 

For example in a two dimensional space defined by the equation 1 the recommendation space can be defined as S Users Items. However it is possible for the recommendation space e.g. for a personalized web content application to be S Users Content Time where the user may assigns a score or rating to the content that was observed by the user at a particular time e.g. recommending what to show to the user when he or she visit a particular website . The user John Doe may assign a rating of 8 to the display of the latest NBA scores on Thursday evenings thus that particular rating can be filled into a multidimensional space defined by R John Doe Latest NBA scores Thursday evening 8. Other examples of using the space in multidimensional applications include recommending certain foods to customers in particular restaurants e.g. S Users Restaurant Food purchasing agent applications e.g. recommending certain food to be bought by particular customers which also depends on the time and place of the products and users etc. . In the above case the space for such multidimensional application is S Users Products Time Place e.g. recommending to John Doe what groceries and in which stores he should make purchases this weekend .

As described above most conventional recommendation systems provide recommendations only of one particular type e.g. recommend top N items to a user . However the multidimensional recommendation system process and software arrangement according to the present invention allows for a greater versatility and various possibilities. For example in the personalized Web content application described above it is possible to request to obtain the top N content items for each user time combination the top N times for each user item combination and or the top N user time combinations for each item. Therefore by utilizing the multiple dimensions e.g. more than two dimensions of various data it is possible to apply recommendation techniques in a much more diverse set of applications than was the case with the conventional two dimensional recommendation systems. It will thus also be possible to obtain new types of recommendations using the multidimensional model according to the present invention.

The OLAP capabilities of also allow for a use of multiple dimensions e.g. sales profits items sold etc. . However such multidimensional data stored by the system having only the traditional OLAP capabilities cannot be used to generate recommendations and or suggestions and may not be able to estimate other ratings so as to fill missing ratings for forming the necessary complete multidimensional data. In addition the conventional recommendations systems and processes did not integrate the functionality of the OLAP capable system therein and thus could not generate versatile recommendations and or suggestion.

Early recommendation systems as described in P. Resnick et al. GroupLens An Open Architecture for Collaborative Filtering of Netnews Proceedings of the 1994 Computer Supported Cooperative Work Conference 1994 operated on a two dimensional matrix of ratings and provided limited profiling capabilities. The reason for this deficiency is due to the fact that the unknown rating estimations were based only on known ratings and neither the user nor item profiles have been used for this purpose. Subsequent techniques used in the conventional recommendation systems used certain profiling capabilities. For example the Pazzani Publication describes how to utilize certain demographic information of the users in the collaborative setting. Also the Mooney Publication described a content based approach which utilized keyword based item profiles. Furthermore the Ansari Publication describes a hybrid approach to rating estimation that uses limited profiling information about both the users and the items.

According to the present invention the profiling capabilities of the recommendation system process and software arrangement can be significantly expanded. In particular a recommendation warehouse consisting of multidimensional i.e. more than two dimensions cubes can be utilized for storing the ratings as well as recording comprehensive profiles representing elements of each dimension therein. shows an exemplary illustration of the recommendation warehouse which includes data that may be filled and utilized by the multidimensional system and process that is executed by the processing arrangement . These profiles may contain a set of various attributes describing each dimension. For example for the user dimension the profile may include attributes such as the name address and phone number of each user as well as the user s preferences e.g. his her favorite food and behavioral characteristics e.g. the largest purchase made at a Web site . Similarly for a Web content dimension the profile may include information about the Web content type e.g. politics finance weather sports science the length of the content item e.g. how long is the news article and the presence or absence of the important keywords in the content item. One or more additional dimensions can be utilized for the recommendation warehouse according to the present invention. Such profiles can be stored as records in relational tables one record for each profile and a separate table for each dimension. Examples of the dimensions can be provided as follows 

The profiles described above allow the recommendation system process and software arrangement to generate complex recommendations. Instead of providing standard recommendation of e.g. top N items to a user the present invention makes it possible to utilize the available profiling information so as to provide more targeted recommendations such as recommending top 3 action movies with either Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger that were released within last 5 years. Each dimension may have a static simple profile e.g. demographic information regarding the user integers floating point numbers strings etc. or a complex profile e.g. sets of rules sequences etc. John Doe rents action movies only on weekends . U.S. Pat. No. 6 236 978 issued to Tuzhilin describes examples of rules profiling techniques and profiles which can be used with the system process and software arrangement of the present invention. Thus it is conceivable according to the present invention to utilized extensive profiles such as e.g. 

A second exemplary alternative embodiment of the query generation step of the process shown in according to the present invention is illustrated in . In this embodiment a query can be generated in step . Then in step one or more portions of the multidimensional cube to be filled are identified and in step the identified portions of the multidimensional cube are then filled. Further the query is executed using the data and or recommendations stored in the multidimensional cube . Exemplary implementation details are described below in Section V.

While OLAP like aggregation capabilities have been used in certain conventional e commerce applications including the storage and analysis of Web usage data as described in A. Buchner et al. Discovering Internet Marketing Intelligence through Online Analytical Web Usage Mining SIGMOD Record 27 4 54 61 1998 and J. Srivastava et al. Web Usage Mining Discovery and Applications of Usage Patterns from Web Data SIGKDD Explorations 1 2 12 23 2000 these capabilities have not been previously utilized in the recommendation systems and processes. The system and process according to the present invention takes conventional OLAP methods and extends them to the recommendation model by e.g. utilizing idiosyncrasies of the recommendation problem and of the rating estimation methods. Indeed various dimensions may have hierarchies associated with them so that they can be appropriately utilized for the present invention. For example a products dimension may include standard industrial product hierarchy and time dimension generally has a temporal hierarchy e.g. minutes hours days months seasons etc. .

Utilizing the above referenced hierarchies the recommendation system process and software arrangement according to the present invention can provide more complex and detailed recommendations which deal not only with individual items but also with groups or sets of items. For example it may be preferable to determine not only how the users enjoy individual movies e.g. R John Doe Gladiator 7 but also how they may appreciate certain categories of movies e.g. R John Doe action movies 5. In addition it may be preferable to also group the users and other dimensions. For example it may be desirable to know to what extent graduate students like Gladiator e.g. R graduate students Gladiator 9.

In general with the individual ratings in the multidimensional cube as shown in it may be preferable to utilize the hierarchies to compute aggregated ratings by knowing how the movies can be grouped based on their genres and it is known how John Doe likes each action movie individually. Particularly shows an exemplary computational diagram of which provides sample aggregation functions which can be performed by the system process and software arrangement of the present invention i.e. using the processing arrangement . With the initial diagram of it is possible to determine e.g. an overall rating of how John Doe likes action movies as a genre by aggregating his individual action movie ratings using the final aggregate diagram . This can be achieved with the following function John Doe action John Doe 3 

The conventional OLAP systems generally generate the aggregation using a simple summation function for all underlying elements. Such approach however is not applicable to the recommendation systems and processes because the ratings usually are not additive by nature. Therefore according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention it is preferable to aggregate the ratings by utilizing various other functions such as AVG MAX MIN and AVG of TOP k. For example the cumulative rating of action movies can be computed for John Doe as follows John Doe action AVG John Doe 4 

In this manner the aggregation based technique according to the present invention as described herein above allows a generation of more complex recommendations that facilitate recommending groups of items users and elements of other dimensions.

The following is a description of an exemplary embodiment of an estimation of unknown ratings for a recommendation system process and software arrangement in a multidimensional recommendation space.

More specifically the rating function R in the equation 3 can initially be defined as a partial function on the recommendation space S where domain Dom R H S which can be defined by explicit ratings specified by the users or obtained implicitly using various proxies to user ratings. See A. Caglayan et al. Learn Sesame a Learning Agent Engine Applied Artificial Intelligence 11 393 412 1997 J. A. Konstan et al. GroupLens Applying Collaborative Filtering to Usenet News Communications of the ACM 40 3 77 87 1997 and D. W. Oard et al. Implicit Feedback for Recommender Systems Recommender Systems. Papers from 1998 Workshop. Technical Report WS 98 08. AAAI Press 1998 . One of the challenges of the multidimensional systems and processes is the extrapolation of the rating function from the initial partial domain H to the whole recommendation space S i.e. the estimation of R x . . . x for the points x . . . x S H based on the initial recommendation ratings R as defined on domain H.

In particular the technique described in the Ansari Publication combines the information regarding the users and the items into a single hierarchical regression based Bayesian preference model that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for exact estimation and prediction. In particular this Bayesian preference model allows a statistical integration of the following types of information useful for making recommendations of items to users a person s expressed preferences e.g. ratings preferences of other consumers expert evaluations item characteristics and characteristics of individuals. For example in case of recommending movies this information may include known movie ratings gender and age of users movie genres movie reviews by critics. This technique of the present invention can be extended to combine information about more than two dimensions by allowing the regressions to include additional variables that describe certain characteristics of other dimensions and not only the items and users.

It should be understood that in addition to or instead of the above described rating estimation techniques which can be used in the process according to the present invention shown in FIG. step other estimation techniques can also be utilized. Indeed the domain expert may select a specific rating estimation function that is most suitable for the application at hand. This is achieved in our model by providing the DEFINE ESTIMATOR and the ESTIMATE commands as a part of the data definition component of the Recommendation Query Language RQL as shall be discussed in further detail below. These commands can preferably be specified by the user e.g. a system administrator and define a particular rating estimation function for an application at hand e.g. DEFINE ESTIMATOR command as well as compute actual ratings ESTIMATE command .

As discussed above the types of recommendations may need to be expressed directly by the users such as customers and business analysts and or by various e commerce systems e.g. shopping robots etc. rather than being hard wired into the recommendation system directly by the vendor. Thus a flexible query language such as RQL would allow the users to express the recommendations in a manner similar to the SQL would allows database queries to be expressed.

The purpose of the data definition language of the RQL is to define various components of the recommendation warehouse such as dimensions cubes and rating estimation methods. Dimensions of the recommendation warehouse such as User Product and Time can be defined in the RQL with a DEFINE DIMENSION command. Also the RQL command DEFINE CUBE can be used for defining multidimensional cubes of ratings. These commands are similar to the data cube definition commands in traditional data warehousing OLAP languages.

The warehouse for a movie recommendation application consisting of two dimensions and a cube of ratings 

It should be noted that each dimension can be represented by a different name and described using a list of attributes characterizing each element of the dimension. That is each element of a dimension can be represented by a profile as described in more detail below. The data cube can be defined by a DEFINE CUBE command that utilizes previously defined dimensions User and Movie in the above example and uses the Rating measure specified with the WITH MEASURES clause. Although most traditional recommendation systems use a single measure multiple measures can also be used according to the present invention as shall be described below. Indeed multiple recommendation criteria may be desired in certain applications such as recommending a restaurant. For example a popular restaurant guide rates restaurants according to four criteria food decor service and cost.

The following is an example of the data warehouse for a vacation recommendation system that may be described with more than two dimensions 

The DEFINE DIMENSION and DEFINE CUBE commands specify the structure of the recommendation warehouse. In addition it is preferable to populate the recommendation warehouse with the recommendation ratings. Therefore the recommendation warehouse should preferably support various rating insertion and estimation methods. User specified ratings are inserted into the warehouse using INSERT and LOAD commands. Functions for estimating the unknown ratings based on the initial user specified ratings are defined with the command 

where estimator name is the name of the rating estimation function defined by this statement and module name denotes a software module e.g. a program file that computes this function. In addition RQL may provide the ESTIMATE command as follows 

which can compute the unknown values for the measure measure name in the cube cube name using the estimation function estimator name previously defined with the DEFINE ESTIMATOR command.

Recommendation queries are preferably expressed in RQL with the RECOMMEND command. The query examples below to provide recommendations are based on the recommendation warehouses defined above in Examples 1 and 2. Example 1 shows the standard type of recommendation supported by most of the current recommendation systems.

This query retrieves all estimated i.e. new user movie ratings from cube MovieRecommender specified in the FROM clause groups them by the user and returns 5 highest ranked movies for each user as specified by the SHOW subclause. The BASED ON subclause specifies that the Rating measure should be used to rank movies.

It should be noted that the above query can be modified so as to recommend users to movies instead of movies to users. The next example illustrates certain selection capabilities of the RQL.

Query 2 For each user who is from New York recommend the top 3 movies including the previously seen ones that are longer than two hours 

Instead of retrieving ratings from the entire MovieRecommender cube it is preferable to utilize the WHERE clause to restrict the results to only include those movies that are longer than 2 hours i.e. 120 minutes and only those users who are from New York. Also the ALL keyword in the USING subclause specifies that all ratings from such restricted cube should be taken into consideration. If the USING subclause would be omitted only the estimated i.e. new ratings would be used when retrieving recommendations by default.

The next example illustrates the support of multiple measures in the RQL as well as the restrictions of the measure values.

Query 3 Recommend to each user the top three most profitable vacations which are also highly rated the rating of at least 8 

In this example both measures defined in VacationRecommender cube as described above in Example 2 are utilized. Rating is used in the WITH subclause to include only vacations that are highly rated i.e. having a rating that is greater than or equal to 8 and Profit is used to rank the alternatives before returning the results.

The next example describes the aggregation capabilities of the RQL and illustrates additional selection capabilities.

Query 4 Recommend movie genres to each user that has previously seen Gladiator but only if the rating for this genre is above 8 

The AGGR BY keyword specifies that movie genres should be recommended rather than the individual movies. Also the AVG average function is used in this query to aggregate and rank the ratings. Further the aggregate ratings can be restricted so that only the ratings that are greater than 8 are considered. The HAS operator allows to specify the restrictions based on what the users have previously done. In particular User HAS Movie.Title Gladiator statement restricts the set of all users to include only the user who have seen the movie Gladiator. Also it should be noted that the SHOW subclause is not utilized in the above exemplary query to include only top k movie genres for each user. Therefore this query retrieves all genres that satisfy all its restrictions.

The semantics of the RECOMMEND statement is as follows. First the cube cube name specified in the FROM clause is restricted using dimension restrictions from the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause is optional. The resulting sub cube is then processed by the RECOMMEND clause. The dimension list1 argument specifies the dimensions that should be recommended whereas dimension list2 specifies the dimensions that should receive the recommendations. These two dimension lists should preferably be disjoint. Also any dimension in these lists can be aggregated based on some of its attributes as illustrated in Query 4. The BASED ON subclause specifies the measure by which recommendations are to be ranked. The USING SHOW and WITH subclauses allow various restrictions to be placed on the measures prior to returning the recommendation query results as illustrated in exemplary Queries 1 4.

The preferred embodiment of the system process and software arrangement which execute the RQL queries enable the RECOMMEND statement to return the recommendations to the end user. In addition as described above it may be preferable to record the recommendation results in the recommendation warehouse as a new cube that can be subsequently queried. It is possible to perform this task using the SAVE CUBE statement. For example the sub cube from Query 2 i.e. containing only ratings of how the users from New York like long movies can be saved as follows 

In another embodiment of the present invention the above described RQL can be used either directly by the power users or as a query language embedded in general programming languages. It is preferable to utilize various GUI based tools e.g. Visual Basic etc. to allow the unsophisticated end users to express their queries using intuitive graphical means and display generated thereby.

With the use of the OLAP systems the multidimensional recommendation model can be implemented in the following manner. The proprietary data structures for cube storage and RQL query processing techniques the details of which are described above can be supported. Alternatively the multidimensional recommendation model can be implemented via the relational data model and the SQL. The main differences of implementing the proprietary e.g. RQL techniques for the data storage and operations as opposed to the use of the existing database technologies and languages e.g. SQL are the high efficiency and performance of the proprietary model and the extensibility as opposed to openness and standardization of the existing database techniques and languages model. See S. Chaudhuri et al. An Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP Technology ACM SIGMOD Record 26 1 65 74 1997 and A. Shoshani OLAP and Statistical Databases Similarities and Differences Proceedings of the Sixteenth ACM SIGACT SIGMOD SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems 1997 pp. 185 196 .

In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention it is possible to map a multidimensional recommendation model into the relational data model and convert the queries of the RQL into the corresponding syntax of the SQL. This exemplary implementation allows the system process and software arrangement according to the present invention to be easily integrated with the existing relational database management systems. Thus it is possible to map the multidimensional data model of the present invention into a specific relational design called the star schema . Each dimension thereof can represented by a single relational table which consists of columns that correspond to attributes of the dimension. Individual records in such table may represent the profiles of the elements of the dimension e.g. user profiles content profiles . The multidimensional cube of ratings can be represented by a single fact table where each record represents an entry in the multidimensional cube i.e. a record in the fact table contains pointers or foreign keys to the corresponding element of each dimension

Accordingly turning back to the high level functional and architectural diagram of performance capabilities which are able to be performed by the processing arrangement of in order to query the resulting relational data model the RQL processing arrangement translates the RQL queries into the corresponding SQL queries and executes the translated SQL query to obtain the requested data from the relational database. The results of SQL queries are then processed by the recommendation processing arrangement and or the processing arrangement and possibly returned to the user. It should be note that the RQL allows the recommendation queries to be expressed at a higher level of abstraction than the SQL and provides for a separation between the practical and conceptual aspects of the recommendation systems. For example considering Query 4 which is expressed in the RQL the translated SQL version of this query would be the following 

For example the WHERE clause of the RQL query is mapped into the SQL s WHERE statement. As illustrated above the use of the RQL is significantly easier to implement i.e. as opposed to the SQL for generating queries using multidimensional recommendation systems processes and software arrangements to provide recommendations to the users at least because the RQL allows the multidimensional recommendation data to be easily manipulated.

Also provided is a description of a technique which facilitates a determination of which ratings are to be computed for a given query. The ratings for the recommendation cube can be computed on the fly or dynamically. In particular given a particular RQL query the system process and software arrangement according to the present invention can determine which portions of the multidimensional recommendation cube are needed to generate the results for the query. Then the ratings can be computed for such portion of the multidimensional recommendation cube after the query is issued. One exemplary technique to determine which portions of the multidimensional recommendation cube are needed is provided as follows.

Similarly to the description above the WHERE clause of the RQL query is mapped into the SQL s WHERE statement. The constraints of the WHERE clause determine the dimensions of the recommendation sub cube in substantially the same manner as is the case for the multidimensional query languages and cubes e.g. as Microsoft s MDX OLAP extensions to SQL or as Microstrategy s ROLAP tool evaluates constraints on the star schema using pure SQL queries . Ratings for the resulting sub cube are calculated in substantially the same manner as for the main sub cube however the number of ratings to be calculated can be significantly smaller for the sub cube.

One having ordinary skill in the art would clearly recognize that many other applications of the embodiments of the system and process for handwriting recognition according to the present invention. Indeed the present invention is in no way limited to the exemplary applications and embodiments thereof described above.
