Next in box the logical network gateway may receive and authenticate credentials from the client device using the logical network user manager the user AAA service on a computing device or another authentication service. To this end the authentication may be carried out using TACACS RADIUS Diameter or other similar protocols as can be appreciated.

If in box the client authentication fails or no response is received within a timeout period in box the logical network gateway transmits a failure code to the client and execution of this portion of the logical network gateway ends as shown. Alternatively if the client authentication succeeds in box the logical network gateway may request permissions associated with the client using the logical network user manager the user AAA service on a computing device or another authorization service. To this end the authorization may be carried out using TACACS RADIUS Diameter or other similar protocols as can be appreciated.

If in box the client fails to have the necessary permissions or no response is received within a timeout period in box the logical network gateway transmits a failure code to the client and execution of this portion of the logical network gateway ends as shown. Alternatively in box if the computing resources currently allocated to the operation of the logical network and the logical network gateway have reached a maximum threshold then in box the logical network gateway or another service may allocate additional computing resources as needed.

Next in box the logical network gateway may begin or continue negotiating the establishment of the logical network tunnel using HTTPS SSL TLS or through other techniques as can be appreciated. If in box the logical network tunnel fails to establish the logical network gateway may in box transmit an appropriate return code to the client. Thereafter execution of this portion of the service offered by logical network gateway ends as shown.

To this end the authorization may be carried out using TACACS RADIUS Diameter or other similar protocols as can be appreciated.

Then in box the logical network configuration manager determines if the client possesses the necessary authorization to disable other user accounts. The authorization may at least in part be determined by the permissions associated with the client account as identified during the authorization action. If the client does not possesses the necessary authorization or if no response is received within a timeout period in box the logical network configuration manager transmits an appropriate failure code to the client and execution of this portion of the logical network configuration manager ends as shown. Alternatively in box if the client is authorized to disable a user account the logical network configuration manager may receive input associated with disabling a user account. Such input may be related to the account identifier for the account that is to be disabled duration for which the account is disabled time at which the account is to be disabled whether the account should be disconnected from a current logical network tunnel etc. Similarly more than one account and or groups may also be disabled using similar techniques.

Next in box the logical network configuration manager may transmit the information associated with disabling the account s group s to the logical network gateway the logical network user manager the user AAA service on a computing device and or another configured authentication authorization service in addition to potentially other actions that may be taken. Subsequently in box if the logical network configuration manager fails to receive a successful acknowledgement or any acknowledgement within a timeout period in box the logical network configuration manager transmits an appropriate failure code to the client and execution of this portion of the logical network configuration manager ends as shown.

Alternatively if the notifications sent are successfully acknowledged by the associated devices and or service then the logical network configuration manager may in box transmit an appropriate return code to the client and execution of this portion of the logical network configuration manager ends as shown.
