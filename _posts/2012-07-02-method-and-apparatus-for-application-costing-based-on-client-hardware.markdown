This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 504 018 filed Jul. 1 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to application costing and more particularly relate to a method apparatus and computer program product for application costing to improve delivery of services based on the hardware of a client device.

The computing industry over time has experienced a rapid growth and evolution. Not only have technological advancements led to new models of computing devices but they have also led to developments in the systems and networks in which the computing devices operate and interact. Each new model of computing device from mainframes and supercomputers to personal computers and mobile devices has brought its own share of advantages as well as challenges.

Over the past several decades computing has been transitioning from distributed systems e.g. mainframes to decentralized systems e.g. personal computers . While the new decentralized client oriented personal computer model provided enhanced flexibility and convenience to users it also resulted in inefficient usage of resources and unnecessary additional costs. For example each personal computer required the processing power and storage capacity necessary for maximum rather than typical loads. As a result the recent trend in computing has been to a centralized model where applications and data can be centrally managed stored and provisioned for the purpose of reducing costs and improving security and efficiency.

One emerging model known as the cloud relies on the delivery of computing resources via a distributed computer network. In such a model one or more servers in the cloud provide services to one or more distributed clients. Services provided by the cloud may range from individual software applications to the full functionality of an operating system. Cloud systems may have drawbacks however such as requiring specialty software to be installed on the client device to enable operation. Such specialty software may limit the availability of the cloud services due to lack of compatibility with the client device or a user lacking privileges for installing the software on the client device.

Additionally the cloud model faces serious challenges in providing these services to end users in a consistent and secure fashion particularly given the wide variety of devices hardware and operating systems that must be served. In many instances the configuration and capabilities of the device may not be considered prior to providing service. As a result some services may be provided that are not compatible with the particular device. For example a service may be provided to a client that requires more physical memory than the client has available.

Therefore a need exists in the art for a computing system that considers the capabilities and configuration of the receiving device when determining whether to provision a particular service.

In this regard the determined hardware information e.g. one or more hardware attributes may be included in the login request. The hardware information may be contained in a text string within the login request for example a serialized text string representing a JavaScript Object Notation JSON object.

In example embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to receive configuration information for the portal interface from the server . The configuration information may indicate one or more services to make available to the user. In this regard a service may refer to any service or application to which access is provided through the portal environment system whether located on the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry in the data center or on a remote entity. The one or more services indicated may be determined by the server based at least in part on the hardware information provided by the service access circuitry . In this regard if the hardware information of the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry does not meet the hardware requirements of a particular service that service may be restricted and therefore not made available to the user. In certain embodiments the configuration information may not restrict all services for which the hardware requirements are not met at login. In this regard the configuration information may initially restrict those services whose hardware requirements are related to hardware information of the terminal apparatus that remains static throughout a session such as video card type total installed memory or the like. The configuration information may not restrict those services whose hardware requirements are related to hardware information that may change during a session such as network connection type power source or the like.

According to various embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to provide for display of the portal interface to the user. In this regard the portal interface may comprise a representation of the one or more services indicated by the configuration information sent by the server . The portal interface may exclude services and applications restricted by the server based on the hardware information. For example in embodiments where the portal interface is embodied as a desktop in a browser restricted services and applications may not have associated icons displayed on the desktop or associated start menu.

In certain embodiments a user may select a service or application provided by the portal environment system for delivery for example by selecting a service from the portal interface. The service access circuitry may be configured to provide for transmission to the server of a request for access to the desired service in some instances via a relay apparatus . In some embodiments the desired service may be stored locally on the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry . In response the service access circuitry may receive one or more requirements associated with the service. The one or more requirements may be based at least in part on conditions related to the hardware of the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry . In example embodiments a requirement may indicate a hardware condition necessary to obtain access to the desired service for example the requirement may indicate that the terminal apparatus must have a wired connection to the Internet. In other embodiments a requirement may indicate a hardware condition that would lead to restriction of the desired service for example the requirement may indicate that the terminal apparatus must not be operating on battery power alone.

According to various embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to determine hardware information related to the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry . In this regard the service access circuitry may be configured to determine the particular hardware information necessary to evaluate the conditions of the one or more requirements of a service. For example if a condition for a particular service requires that the terminal apparatus must have a wired network connection the service access circuitry may be configured to determine the network connection status of the terminal apparatus .

In example embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to determine the hardware information of the terminal apparatus via one or more hardware information requests. In this regard the service access circuitry may be configured to communicate with one or more hardware devices associated with the terminal apparatus . The hardware request may occur via an application programming interface API provided by a software development kit SDK associated with one or more of the hardware devices. For example a hardware request may be made via a JavaScript function call for example from within an Internet browser or a desktop built in a browser portal interface. In some embodiments each hardware request corresponds to a single item of hardware information. In other embodiments a single hardware request may correspond to more than one item of hardware information. Various examples of the hardware information that may be obtained through a hardware request include current central processing unit CPU utilization maximum average CPU utilization chipset chip support for one time password OTP charging status power source i.e. battery or power cord battery charge percentage battery time remaining current memory usage current memory available total memory installed available hard drive space total hard drive space network bandwidth network connection type i.e. wired or wireless video card model current screen resolution maximum screen resolution supported screen resolutions mouse availability keyboard availability speaker availability microphone availability or the like.

According to example embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to evaluate the conditions of the one or more requirements of a service based at least in part on the determined hardware information. In this regard the service access circuitry may be configured to compare the hardware information of the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry with the conditions of the one or more requirements associated with a particular service. In some embodiments the service access circuitry may determine that the hardware of the terminal apparatus meets the requirements of the service. In these embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to provide access to the service. In other embodiments the service access circuitry may determine that the hardware of the terminal apparatus does not meet the requirements of the service. In these embodiments the service access circuitry may restrict access to the service.

In embodiments where the service access circuitry restricts access to a service the service access circuitry may be configured to provide for display of a notification to the user that the service is temporarily or permanently restricted due to the hardware of the terminal apparatus . The notification may indicate the hardware requirement not met by the terminal apparatus that led to the restriction.

According to certain embodiments a condition of the hardware requirement may be a static hardware condition that may not be altered during a session with the portal environment system. For example the hardware requirement may indicate that a particular chipset is necessary for access to the requested service. In this regard a user may not be able to resolve the issue by changing the chipset of the terminal apparatus during the session. To gain access to the requested service a user may be required to log out of the session resolve the issue and re attempt to log on. The user may also log out of the session and attempt to log on from a different terminal apparatus having the appropriate hardware required for the requested service.

In other embodiments a condition of the hardware requirement may not be a static hardware condition for example the service may require that the terminal apparatus have a wired network connection. In these instances the service access circuitry may be configured to cause display of a warning notification to the user indicating the non static condition of the hardware requirement that is preventing the user from accessing the service. The user may in response adjust the non static condition to meet the hardware requirement. In accordance with the example discussed above the user may establish a wired network connection to the terminal apparatus to meet the wired network connection requirement. The user may then provide an indication to the service access circuitry that the condition has been adjusted to meet the hardware requirement for example by selecting a retry option in the warning notification display. In some instances the user may be permitted to override the restriction for example by selecting an override option on a warning notification display.

According to various embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to provide for transmission of a report to the server indicating whether the terminal apparatus has met all of the conditions for the requirements associated with the service. In embodiments where the requirements have been met the report may request that the server allow access to the service. In other embodiments where one or more requirements have not been met the report may request that the server restrict access to the service.

In some example embodiments the service access circuitry may not be configured to evaluate the conditions of the one or more requirements of a service based at least in part on the determined hardware information. Rather in these embodiments the server may be configured to evaluate the requirements. In this regard the service access circuitry may be configured to provide for transmission of the determined hardware information to the server for the server to evaluate. The service access circuitry may be configured to receive an indication from the server identifying whether the hardware of the terminal apparatus associated with the service access circuitry meets the requirements for the service. In embodiments where the hardware of the terminal apparatus meets the requirements the service access circuitry may be configured to allow access to the requested service. In other embodiments where the hardware of the terminal apparatus does not meet the requirements the service access circuitry may be configured to restrict the service or provide a warning notification to the user regarding a temporary restriction as described above.

According to various embodiments the service access circuitry may be configured to evaluate the hardware information of the terminal apparatus at any time. In this regard the service access circuitry may not be limited to evaluating the hardware information of the terminal apparatus when logging on to a portal environment system or when selecting applications for delivery during a session. For example the service access circuitry may be configured to evaluate the hardware information of the terminal apparatus in response to an auditing event or other similar trigger.

The following provides a non limiting example of one embodiment and should not be construed to narrow the scope or spirit of the disclosure in any way. In this example a user attempts to open Skype video calling through a desktop in a browser portal environment system via a web browser running on the user s laptop. The web browser sends a request for delivery of the Skype service to a server in the portal environment system. The server has previously associated a hardware requirement with the Skype service namely the server requires that the user s laptop has a wired network connection due to the high network demands of video calling. Thus the server sends a message to the user s desktop in a browser indicating that a wired network connection is required for delivery of the Skype service. The desktop in a browser then determines the type of network connection currently established by the user s laptop. In this example the user s current network connection is wireless rather than wired. Therefore upon evaluating the network connection requirement sent by the server the desktop in a browser may determine that the laptop is not presently configured for the requested Skype video calling service.

According to this example the desktop in a browser may display an alert to the user explaining that a wired network connection is required for the requested service. In response the user may establish a wired connection on the laptop and repeat the process described above. Upon evaluating the requirement at this point the desktop in a browser may determine that the user s laptop now has a wired network connection which satisfies the requirement and deliver the requested Skype video calling service to the user.
