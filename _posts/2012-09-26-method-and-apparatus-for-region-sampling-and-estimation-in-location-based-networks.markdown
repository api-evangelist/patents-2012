title: Method and apparatus for region sampling and estimation in location based networks
abstract: Various embodiments provide a method and apparatus for obtaining a representative sample set of venues (i.e., places) within a geographic region in a location based network using a low cost and efficient sampling and estimating algorithm. In particular, a dynamic random region sampling algorithm randomly selects a target location within a geographic region and then determines a sub-region containing the target location within the geographic region based on venue density prediction. Venue density prediction is based on a weighted average of venue densities of two or more comparable locations within the geographic region.
