When content such as a movie or television show are presented on a device a user may indicate a request to pause playback of the content. Then the timing at which playback of the content is paused may be captured and stored. For instance the user may be viewing streaming content via the Internet and the playback of the content may be associated with a user account at a content provider. In this case the timing at which playback of the content is paused may be stored on a server configured to provide content management and or playback services. Then when the user resumes playback of the content later playback may be resumed at the point in time at which playback was previously paused.

Reference will now be made in detail to some specific examples of the invention including the best modes contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Examples of these specific embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention is described in conjunction with these specific embodiments it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments. On the contrary it is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

For example the techniques of the present invention will be described in the context of fragments particular servers and encoding mechanisms. However it should be noted that the techniques of the present invention apply to a wide variety of different fragments segments servers and encoding mechanisms. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. Particular example embodiments of the present invention may be implemented without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.

Various techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity. However it should be noted that some embodiments include multiple iterations of a technique or multiple instantiations of a mechanism unless noted otherwise. For example a system uses a processor in a variety of contexts. However it will be appreciated that a system can use multiple processors while remaining within the scope of the present invention unless otherwise noted. Furthermore the techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes describe a connection between two entities. It should be noted that a connection between two entities does not necessarily mean a direct unimpeded connection as a variety of other entities may reside between the two entities. For example a processor may be connected to memory but it will be appreciated that a variety of bridges and controllers may reside between the processor and memory. Consequently a connection does not necessarily mean a direct unimpeded connection unless otherwise noted.

A content management account may provide a unified way of viewing content on a variety of devices and from a variety of sources. In many cases a content management account may be shared by several users such as members of the same family. These users may sometimes view the same content either alone or in groups.

In some instances a user viewing content may wish to pause the content and resume playback later. Accordingly the system may identify a time at which content playback is paused so that content playback may later be resumed at the same time. However when several users share the same account different users may wish to pause and resume playback at different points for the same content item.

According to various embodiments more than one pause point may be created for a content item. Each pause point may be linked with a different profile associated with the content management account. When playback of the content item is initiated a user interface may provider viewers with the opportunity to select a particular pause point for resuming playback.

At content is presented at a playback device. According to various embodiments the content may be video content audio content and or any other type of content. For instance the content may be a movie a television program a music album or an audiobook.

According to various embodiments the content may be received from various sources. For example the content may be streamed or downloaded via a network such as the Internet from a content provider. As another example the content may be received from a local or network storage location. As yet another example the content may be received via a cable or satellite television network connection.

At pause event information for a content playback pause event is captured. According to various embodiments capturing pause event information may involve identifying various types of information. This information may include but is not limited to a time at which playback is paused one or more user profiles associated with the pause event one or more group profiles associated with the pause event and one or more devices associated with the pause event. Techniques for capturing pause event information for a content playback pause event are discussed in additional detail with respect to .

According to various embodiments information regarding more than one content playback pause event may be captured. For example content playback may be paused for one user while a second user continues watching. Later the second user may also pause playback. As another example two users associated with the same content management account may separately view content and separately pause playback at two different points in the content.

At a selection of a pause event for resuming playback is received. According to various embodiments the selection may be received from a user input device associated with the playback device. For instance the selection may be received via a touch screen a mouse a keyboard eye tracking or any other user input technique. Examples of user interfaces that may be used to display pause points and receive user input selecting a pause point are shown in .

According to various embodiments the selection of a pause event for resuming playback may be received at various times. For example a user may pause playback for a brief period of time and then quickly resume playback. As another example a user may pause playback and walk away from the device not returning to continue viewing the content for weeks or months.

At playback of the content is resumed at the pause point associated with the selected pause event. According to various embodiments resuming playback may involve loading the video into a video player from a local or network storage location presenting streaming video on demand received via a network activating an audio stream or any other content for presenting content. Techniques for resuming playback based on the selection of a pause point are discussed in additional detail with respect to .

The fragment system is one example of a system that may be used for viewing pausing and resuming content playback. According to various embodiments a fragment system may be used to encode content into fragments for streaming to a client device. While the content is being presented at the client device playback may be paused. Later when playback is resumed the next unplayed fragment may be transmitted to the client machine. In particular embodiments the application servers and or the HTTP proxy may be used to receive process and or store pause event information for resuming playback.

The fragment server provides the caching layer with fragments for clients. The design philosophy behind the client server application programming interface API minimizes round trips and reduces complexity as much as possible when it comes to delivery of the media data to the client . The fragment server provides live streams and or DVR configurations.

The fragment controller is connected to application servers and controls the fragmentation of live channel streams. The fragmentation controller optionally integrates guide data to drive the recordings for a global network DVR. In particular embodiments the fragment controller embeds logic around the recording to simplify the fragment writer component. According to various embodiments the fragment controller will run on the same host as the fragment writer . In particular embodiments the fragment controller instantiates instances of the fragment writer and manages high availability.

According to various embodiments the client uses a media component that requests fragmented MPEG 4 files allows trick play and manages bandwidth adaptation. The client communicates with the application services associated with HTTP proxy to get guides and present the user with the recorded content available.

At video content is presented on a playback device. According to various embodiments the content may be presented in association with a content management account. The content management account may be provided by a content management provider. The content management provider may facilitate the organization and transmission of content from a variety of sources to a variety of content playback devices. For example the content management account may be used to organize live or video on demand content streamed over a network such as the Internet content received via a cable or satellite television network. As another example the content management account may be used to transmit content to devices such as televisions computers and mobile devices. As yet another example the content management account may be used to manage the viewing of content stored on a local storage device or a network storage location.

Although the content is described in as video content in some instances other types of content may be presented. For example audio content such as an audio book a song or a music album may be presented for playback.

At an account associated with the video content playback is identified. According to various embodiments the account may be a content management account as discussed herein. In some cases a device may be linked with a content management account. In particular embodiments a user may provide login information identifying a content management account.

According to various embodiments the account may be used at least in part for identifying a pause event. For instance when watching a television show received via an on demand network a user may pause playback. Because the content playback is linked to a content management account the pause event may be recorded. Then when playback of the television show is resumed via the on demand network or via any other content source content playback may be resumed at the point at which it was paused.

At a pause event associated with the video content playback is identified. According to various embodiments the pause event may be any event that interrupts or terminates playback of the video content. For example the pause event may be the detection of user input such as a button press mouse click or touch screen input requesting to pause the video content. As another example the pause event may be the detection of a service interruption in a content stream received from a remote server when the video content is received by streaming. As yet another example the pause event may be the detection of the content playback device being powered off such as by a loss of battery power for a mobile device the activation of a power off button by the user or some other such occurrence.

In particular embodiments playback of the content need not actually be paused in order for a pause event to be detected. For instance in some situations several users may all be viewing content playback performed on a single device such as a television. If one of the users wishes to walk away from the television while the others wish to continue to view the content then the user may provide user input for indicating a pause event specific to the user. For example the user may provide user input on the content playback device by selecting a profile associated with the user.

According to various embodiments a pause event associated with the video content playback may be detected at a device other than the one on which content is being presented. For instance a group of users may be viewing content on a device such as a television while one user is using a personal device such as a tablet computer or a mobile phone. The personal device may be displaying a connected user interface that is linked to the television and the content presented on the television. The connected user interface may present information related to the content presented on the television. For example the information may include biographical information regarding cast or crew members social media information related to the content or suggestions regarding related content. In some instances a user may indicate a desire to pause playback of content by providing user input on the personal device.

At a pause time associated with the pause event is identified. According to various embodiments the time may be measured relative to the length of the content. For instance a time of 1 15 may indicate that the first one hour 15 minutes of the content item has already been presented when playback is paused. Alternately such a time may indicate that there is one hour 15 minutes remaining in the playback of the content item after the pause point. In particular embodiments an actual time associated with the pause event may also be identified. For instance a system may discard pause events that occurred far in the past and only store the most recent pause events.

At a user profile associated with the pause event is determined. According to various embodiments a user profile may be associated with any user or group of users who views content in association with the account identified in operation . The user profile may be identified by a name number avatar icon and or any other identification techniques.

According to various embodiments the user profile may be determined based on user input. For example a user may provide user input selecting a user profile from a list of profiles. As another example user input may be provided via a playback device connected with the presentation of content. For instance a group of users may be viewing content on a television. At the same time one user may be viewing a connected user interface on a personal device such as a mobile phone. The connected user interface may display information related to the content presented on the television. In this case the user of the personal device may indicate a desire to pause playback by providing user input at the personal device. When the user input is received the pause event may be captured without interrupting playback of the content on the television.

According to various embodiments the user profile may be determined automatically. For example a pause event may be captured at a personal playback device linked to a user account. For instance a group of users may be viewing content on a television while another user views a connected user interface on a personal device such as a mobile phone. The personal device may be linked with a user profile such that when a user of the device indicates a desire to pause playback the pause event is automatically associated with the user profile.

At a device profile associated with the pause event is determined According to various embodiments determining a device profile associated with the pause event may involve identifying a device on which the content is playing. For instance a device may provide an identifier or other information to a content management server when playback is initiated. In particular embodiments determining a device profile associated with the pause event may involve receiving user input selecting a device associated with the content management account identified in operation .

At the pause event information characterizing the pause event is stored. According to various embodiments the pause event information may be stored on a server in communication with the playback device. For instance the pause event information may be stored on a server configured to provide content management services to many different client machines and for many different content management accounts. In particular embodiments the pause event information may be stored on the playback device itself. For instance the playback device may not be in communication with a remote server when the pause event is detected.

According to various embodiments not all of the operations shown in need be performed. For example in some cases a pause event may be associated with a user profile as discussed with respect to operation but not a device profile as discussed with respect to operation . As another example in other cases the reverse may be true.

At a request to present video content on a playback device is received. According to various embodiments the request may be received at the playback device. The request may then be transmitted to a server configured to provide content management services. For example the user may navigate to the content via a content management interface presented on the playback device. As another example the user may select content via an electronic program guide.

At an account associated with content presentation is identified. According to various embodiments the presentation of video content may be associated with a content management account for managing the presentation of content received from various sources and presented on various devices. The content management account may be identified by receiving login information from a user or device by identifying a characteristic of the device from which the request is received or via any other identification technique.

At a determination is made as to whether the requested video content is associated with a pause event. According to various embodiments the determination may be made by analyzing pause event information associated with the content management account identified at operation .

In particular embodiments the content need not be requested from the same source as the source from which it was originally received. For example a user may have initially been watching a television program received via a cable television network. Then the user may have paused playback of the television program and information regarding the captured pause event may have been stored on a server. Next the user may resume watching the same television program at a later date but this time the user may elect to view the television program via an on demand content streaming service such as Netflix or Amazon. However because the pause event was associated with the content in conjunction with the content management account that can be used to manage content received from various services playback of the content may be resumed at the pause point.

At the pause event information characterizing the pause event is presented at the playback device. According to various embodiments various techniques may be used to present the pause event information. For example as is shown in a playback bar control element may be presented for displaying information related to content playback. Pause point markers designating different pause points may then be imposed on the playback bar. As another example as is shown in a list of pause points may be included in a user interface for initiating playback of the content. As yet another example a message may be displayed on a device that is associated with a particular pause point.

At a selection of a pause event for initiating playback of the requested video content is received. According to various embodiments the request may be received based on user input. For instance a user may activate a touch screen press a button or click a mouse to select one of the pause events displayed at operation . Alternately the selection may be made at least in part automatically. For instance the selection may be generated automatically when a pause point is linked to a particular playback device and when a request to resume content playback is received from that playback device.

According to various embodiments since several pause points may be associated with the same content item accessed via a content management account a technique or mechanism may be used to ensure that a user does not inadvertently select an incorrect pause point. Inadvertently selecting an incorrect pause point may lead to the pause point being lost and the user or device with whom the pause point is actually associated no longer being able to resume playback from the pause point. Accordingly a selection interface for pause points may require a personal identification number PIN or other such information in order to resume playback at a pause point. Alternately or additionally resuming playback from a pause point may require input provided from a personal playback device such as a mobile phone.

At playback of the requested video content is initiated. As discussed herein content may be received from a variety of sources and or may be presented for playback at a variety of devices. When content is received via a streaming source video content playback may be resumed by requesting the next unviewed segment of the video content for playback. When the video content is located on a local or remote storage device content playback may be resumed by loading the video content and navigating to the time associated with the selected pause point.

The fragment server provides the caching layer with fragments for clients. The design philosophy behind the client server API minimizes round trips and reduces complexity as much as possible when it comes to delivery of the media data to the client . The fragment server provides VoD content.

According to various embodiments the client uses a media component that requests fragmented MPEG 4 files allows trick play and manages bandwidth adaptation. The client communicates with the application services associated with HTTP proxy to get guides and present the user with the recorded content available.

The user interface shown in also includes a playback bar control element for showing information such as a total time length of the video content and a time marker corresponding to the current playback time relative to the total time length. In some user interfaces a user may navigate to different times during the playback of the video content by clicking on the playback bar and or dragging the time marker.

The playback bar in includes pause point markers for pause points associated with four different user profiles. In the pause point markers are labeled as User through User . According to various embodiments however pause point markers may be labeled with user or device names avatars icons or other such content. Each of the pause point markers is linked to a respective point on the playback bar. In this way a user viewing the playback bar may readily identify the time at which playback was paused for each pause point.

In the example shown in a user may select one of the four pause points by clicking it or by touching the display screen. According to various embodiments however various techniques may be used to select a pause point. For instance a list of pause points may be presented in a popup window and the user may select one of the listed pause points. When a pause point is selected playback of the video content may be resumed at the time associated with the selected pause point.

In a content navigation user interface is shown. In the user interface the movie Pan s Labyrinth is selected. In the selection interface for the movie a list of pause points is presented for resuming playback. As in the pause points are labeled as User through User . The user may select one of these pause points to resume playback at the time associated with the selected playback as discussed with respect to .

According to various embodiments a selection interface for pause points may be toggled on or off within the user interface. For instance in some situations a user may wish to initiate playback from the beginning of a video without viewing playback resumed from a pause point.

Particular examples of interfaces supported include Ethernet interfaces frame relay interfaces cable interfaces DSL interfaces token ring interfaces and the like. In addition various very high speed interfaces may be provided such as fast Ethernet interfaces Gigabit Ethernet interfaces ATM interfaces HSSI interfaces POS interfaces FDDI interfaces and the like. Generally these interfaces may include ports appropriate for communication with the appropriate media. In some cases they may also include an independent processor and in some instances volatile RAM. The independent processors may control communications intensive tasks such as packet switching media control and management.

According to various embodiments the system is a server that also includes a transceiver streaming buffers and a program guide database. The server may also be associated with subscription management logging and report generation and monitoring capabilities. In particular embodiments the server can be associated with functionality for allowing operation with mobile devices such as cellular phones operating in a particular cellular network and providing subscription management capabilities. According to various embodiments an authentication module verifies the identity of devices including mobile devices. A logging and report generation module tracks mobile device requests and associated responses. A monitor system allows an administrator to view usage patterns and system availability. According to various embodiments the server handles requests and responses for media content related transactions while a separate streaming server provides the actual media streams.

Although a particular server is described it should be recognized that a variety of alternative configurations are possible. For example some modules such as a report and logging module and a monitor may not be needed on every server. Alternatively the modules may be implemented on another device connected to the server. In another example the server may not include an interface to an abstract buy engine and may in fact include the abstract buy engine itself. A variety of configurations are possible.

In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims below. Accordingly the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of invention.
