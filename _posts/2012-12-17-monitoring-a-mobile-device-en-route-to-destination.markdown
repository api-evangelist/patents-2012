title: Monitoring a mobile device en route to destination
abstract: A system, method and apparatus are disclosed for monitoring a mobile device en route to a destination. A user of a monitored device specifies geo-fence regions along a route to the destination. Entry and exit of regions triggers the sending of event notifications to a monitoring device. Event notifications may be sent if an estimated time of arrival changes due to delay. Event notifications may be sent if the monitored device deviates from a planned route by a threshold distance. Event notifications may be sent through a direct communication link between the monitored device and monitoring device or through a location-based service.

Most people have experienced the anxiety of waiting for a loved one to arrive safely at a destination. Typically one knows the departure time destination and estimated time of arrival of a traveler. When the traveler arrives safely at the destination contact is made through telephone e mail or text messaging to confirm safe arrival.

There are instances however where a traveler s estimated time of arrival is delayed due to traffic severe weather flat tire or some other event. If the traveler is traveling on an airplane a flight tracker application may be used to determine when their plane is estimated to arrive at a destination airport. If the traveler is traveling in a car train boat bus or on foot there is often no convenient way to know whether the traveler will be delayed or is in need of assistance without the traveler initiating contact or without the concerned individual making many phone calls to track down the traveler s whereabouts.

A system method and apparatus are disclosed for monitoring a mobile device en route to a destination. A user of a monitored device specifies geo fence regions along a route to the destination. Entry and exit of regions triggers the sending of event notifications to a monitoring device. Event notifications may be sent if an estimated time of arrival changes due to delay. Event notifications may be sent if the monitored device deviates from a planned route by a threshold distance. Event notifications may be sent through a direct communication link between the monitored device and monitoring device or through a location based service.

In some implementations a method comprises receiving at a first device input specifying a route with a departure location a destination location and one or more intermediate locations receiving at the first device input specifying regions around the departure location the destination location and the one or more intermediate locations receiving a request to allow monitoring of the first device by a second device sending an acceptance of the request to the second device detecting at the first device an entry or exit event of the first device into or out of a specified region and sending a notification to the second device in response to the detecting.

In some implementations a method comprises sending from a first device a request to monitor a second device while the second device is en route to a destination receiving at the first device acceptance of the request receiving a first event notification that the second device has exited a departure region automatically initiating monitoring of the second device in response to the event notification and receiving during monitoring a second event notification indicating that the second device has entered or exited an intermediate region or a destination region.

Particular implementations disclosed herein provide one or more of the following advantages. A user may monitor the travel of an individual and receive notifications automatically when the individual is delayed or in need of assistance.

Other implementations are disclosed for systems methods and apparatus. The details of the disclosed implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Departure region is defined by a geo fence surrounding geographic location which in this example is a home of the user operating monitored device . Checkpoint region is defined by a geo fence surrounding geographic location which in this example is a departure train station. Destination region is defined by a geo fence surrounding geographic location which in this example is a destination train station. Geographic locations may be any desired location along a route including homes offices points of interest bus stations train stations airport terminals boat docks businesses etc. A route may include one or more route segments traversing land air sea or other water way.

In the example shown a user carrying monitored device is travelling from geographic location by car along route segment e.g. a highway to departure train station and then by train along route segment to destination train station . Monitored device can be any location aware device capable of communicating with other devices including but not limited to smart phones electronic tablets and personal computers. Monitored device may include one or more processors configured to monitor the entry and exit of regions based on data from onboard positioning systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems GNSS such as Global Positioning System GPS wireless positioning systems e.g. Wi Fi 3G 4G and cellular positioning systems e.g. cell ID .

In the example shown when monitored device exits departure region a timestamp is generated by monitored device and stored on monitored device e.g. in memory and or in database accessible by LBS . Monitored device may include an internal clock or timer configured to generate the timestamp. An estimated time of arrival ETA may be calculated by monitored device for checkpoint region . The ETA may be calculated based on the departure time distance to checkpoint region travel speed and traffic information. Travel speed and direction may be determined using sensor data from sensors e.g. accelerometers gyros magnetometer embedded in or coupled to monitored device . In some implementations ETA may be calculated by a vehicle navigation system e.g. portable or built in car navigation system and shared with monitored device through a wireless e.g. Bluetooth connection or wired connection. Traffic information may be provided by a server computer in LBS or by an independent traffic monitoring service. The ETA may be stored on monitored device or database .

When monitored device enters or exits checkpoint region a timestamp is generated by monitored device and stored on monitored device and or in database . In addition monitored device may also compute a dwell time by subtracting the entry timestamp from the exit timestamp for checkpoint region .

Upon exit of checkpoint region an ETA at destination region is calculated and stored on monitored device or database . In this example since the transportation mode is a train and route is a train track the ETA may be calculated from a train departure arrival schedule and any known delay information. In some implementations sensor data from sensors onboard monitored device can be used to calculated or update the ETA. When monitored device enters destination region an arrival timestamp is computed and stored on monitored device and or database .

In the example shown a user monitors the progress of monitored device using monitoring device . As described in reference to monitoring device can send a route sharing request to monitored device . If the user of monitored device accepts the request e.g. user accepts through a user interface monitoring device will receive event notifications from monitored device as monitored device traverses route segments and enters and exits regions . Event notifications may be any event that provides information regarding the status of monitored device while traveling en route including any deviations from the planned route segments by a threshold distance delays or change in device behavior. Some examples of status may include but are not limited to notifications when the monitored device has entered or exited a geo fence region and the corresponding entry or exit timestamps ETA updates dwell times exceeding maximum or minimum thresholds sensor readings indicating a deviation e.g. change in location speed or direction from the planned route or change in mode of transportation a lost communication link with the monitored device calls made to emergency services etc.

The user of monitoring device may begin monitoring of monitored device by entering a monitoring mode manually through a user interface presented on a display of monitoring device provided by a software application operating system or web service. In some implementations monitoring may be initiated using a voice command and speech recognition technology implemented on monitoring device . In some implementations monitoring may be initiated automatically after receiving a departure notification from monitored device . In this latter scenario the user of monitoring device can request route sharing and the request may be kept pending until accepted by the user of monitored device . Thus there is a pre negotiation between monitoring device and monitored device prior to the monitored device embarking en route to the destination. On a specified day and time of departure a notification may be sent from monitored device to monitoring device when monitored device exits departure region . The monitoring remains active until terminated by the users of devices or until the destination is reached which can be indicated by notification of an entry of monitored device into destination region .

Notifications may include a map or map data for generating a map on monitoring device using a mapping application installed on monitoring device . The map can be displayed on monitoring device and show through suitable visual markers regions route segments connecting regions traffic information e.g. color coded and overlaid on route segments and the current location of monitored device . In some implementations notifications may include dwell times e.g. to indicate delays alerts for unexplained change in location or direction e.g. may indicate an alternate route taken due to an accident speed e.g. may indicate new mode of transportation or an accident blocking route and any calls placed on monitored device to emergency services. In some implementations a click to call link to the monitored device can be presented on monitoring device to allow the user of monitoring device to call monitored device directly without searching through a call directory or contacts database for a number. Notifications can be presented on monitoring device as a graphic animation audio text or force feedback e.g. vibration .

User interface includes elements representing options for selecting contact sources. These contact sources include but are not limited to contact databases social networks buddy lists and manual specification of a contact. A contact is an individual that is to be tracked. In the example shown element is selected allowing the user to select a contact from a contact database on or accessible through monitoring device .

When the user touches element a request message is sent to monitored device and may be presented to the user in a user interface text message e mail or any other suitable mode of communication. The request may be kept pending for a predetermined amount of time. The request message may include the name and mobile number of the requestor. The request may be accepted by the user of monitored device or programmatically by an application or operating system running on monitored device . After acceptance of the request monitored device waits for the date and time of departure to arrive e.g. through a system clock or calendar event and within a predetermined amount of time after the time of departure waits for a geo fence exit event to be detected. When the exit event is detected e.g. by a hardware processor a departure event notification is sent to monitoring device which starts the monitoring process on monitoring device .

As shown in the user of monitored device can set a number of geo fence parameters. These parameters include Name Date Time Latitude Longitude Radius and Dwell Time. The Name field is used to name the geo fence region. In this example the user has specified names in Name fields for three geo fence regions Departure Checkpoint A and Destination. The Date and Time fields are used to specify when monitored device is expected to enter the region. The latitude and longitude fields allow the user to specify geographic locations which define the centers of the regions. The Radius field allows the user to specify the size of the geo fence. The Dwell Time field allows the user to specify how long monitored device is expected to stay in a given region. Adding the value in the Dwell Time field to the value in the Time field gives an expected maximum time of exit from the region. If this maximum time is exceeded a new ETA is computed and a notification of the event is sent to monitoring device along with the updated ETA.

The geo fence region settings may be stored on monitored device or in database . Controls may be used to add or delete geo fence regions. For example selecting the control adds a set of blank geo fence settings fields and selecting the control opens a list of geo fence regions with a delete button that allows the user to delete geo fence regions. The user can save geo fence region settings to a route file that may be uploaded with other route data generated by a mapping or routing application to database for sharing with other devices such as monitoring device . In some implementations user interface may be a web page provided by a web server in LBS .

In portion the user may specify e.g. though check boxes a mode of communication for event notifications e.g. e mail text message cellular and whether to include a map or map data as previously described in reference to . Other settings are also possible. For example date and time range fields may be provided for specifying a date and time range when notifications are sent to prevent false triggers at times when no monitoring is requested.

In some implementations process may begin by receiving at a first device input specifying a route with a departure location a destination location and one or more intermediate locations . An example user interface for implementing this step is shown in . Process may continue by receiving a request to allow monitoring of the first device by a second device and sending an acceptance of the request to the second device . An example user interface for sending a request from a monitoring device is shown in . During monitoring process may continue by detecting at the first device an entry or exit event of the first device into or out of a specified region and sending an event notification to the second device in response to the detecting . The event notifications may be sent by any suitable mode of communication such as e mail text message or cellular network.

In some implementations process may begin by sending from a first device a request to monitor a second device while the second device is en route to a destination . Process may continue by receiving at the first device acceptance of the request . Process may continue by receiving a first event notification that the second device has exited a departure region and automatically initiating monitoring of the second device in response to the event notification . Process may continue by receiving during monitoring a second event notification indicating that the second device has entered or exited an intermediate region or a destination region .
