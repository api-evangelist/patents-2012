This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 553 884 entitled Systems and Methods for Capturing Employee Time for Time Attendance Management filed on Oct. 31 2011 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This document relates to techniques and methods to capture employee work time as part of a time and attendance management solution.

Businesses can track the amount of time their employees spend at work using specially designed time clocks. Time clocks allow employees to enter the time they begin working and again enter the time when the employee ends working. Time clocks generally range from mechanical clocks that require an employee has to insert and punch a paper card to electronic time clocks that allow employees to swipe magnetic identification cards to register times. Time clocks can be standalone hardware devices that are installed on a business s premises. Time clocks typically interact with an electronic system that stores time entries that are submitted to the time clock. Such time clocks can require regular maintenance from qualified personnel.

Systems and methods relating to capturing employee data for time and attendance management are described. In general in one implementation a technique for capturing employee time and attendance includes using a multi touch tablet device as a time clock hereinafter Cloud Clock . Employees can interact with the multi touch table device to punch in e.g. record a time they begin working and to punch out e.g. record a time they stop working. In some implementations employees can punch in and punch out using the multi touch tablet device by standing in front of the Cloud Clock with a personal identification ID card. The Cloud Clock device can use a front facing video camera to identify employees and log their respective time records each time the employees punch in and punch out. In some implementations the Cloud Clock logs the times in a web based application that tracks employee work hours. In some implementations the Cloud Clock can be used as a self service station at which employees can access their schedules request time off or revise their schedules e.g. trade shifts with other employees . The Cloud Clocks can be loaded with management software that allows the Cloud Clocks to be remotely monitored for anomalies. The Cloud Clocks can also be updated remotely without requiring user intervention at the Cloud Clock.

The Cloud Clock can include a capacitive touch panel for multi touch user interaction a front facing video camera to capture digital images of employees and identification cards WiFi connectivity to an application cloud a Global Positioning System GPS for geo fencing an accelerometer for detecting unauthorized motion a configurable software platform on the device for easy customization an over the air remote management functionality and an on board battery to handle power outages.

Time entries can be synchronized between Cloud Clocks and application servers in real time over a network. In some implementations the data can be sent over authenticated and encrypted channels to the application servers. The Cloud Clocks can be sold along with a wireless access point that is pre configured to work with the Cloud Clocks . This enables customers to quickly setup the Cloud Clocks and establish connectivity with the application servers .

In some implementations the Cloud Clock can be remotely monitored by a service in the cloud for faults including power outages and network outages. Any loss of power or network connectivity to the Cloud Clock can be automatically detected by the server. Upon detection the appropriate personnel e.g. local administrators can be notified e.g. notified through email or text messages .

In some implementations the Cloud Clock can run a monitor client program in the background that continuously measures the wireless network strength the remaining power in the battery and the charging status. The monitor client program can send periodically in response to a trigger event or request heartbeats to a monitoring service. Each heartbeat can include measurements of the network power and charging state. The monitoring service can check the incoming heart beats of each clock against thresholds to determine if a Cloud Clock is losing power or has poor network connectivity.

In some implementations the Cloud Clock can be remotely monitored by a service for theft or unauthorized movement from an installed location. An accelerometer or other motion sensor and or on board GPS can be used to detect unauthorized movement of the Cloud Clock and local administrators will be notified. The Cloud Clock can be loaded with management software that allows the clocks to be remotely monitored for anomalies. The Cloud Clock can also be updated remotely without requiring user intervention at the Cloud Clock.

For example when a clock is accidentally or intentionally pulled or displaced from its mounting the on board accelerometer will detect the motion and send an alert to a monitoring service in the cloud. Managers can track these alerts and suitable action can be taken to restore the Cloud Clock to its original setting. In some cases the on board GPS receiver can be utilized to track the movement of the Cloud Clock from the point of its original setting. For example the GPS receiver can be used to track a person who is carrying the Cloud Clock away from its mounting location.

The Cloud Clock can be mounted on a powered pedestal or setup on a desktop or mounted securely on a wall. The Cloud Clock can be connected at all times wirelessly to application servers over a network e.g. Internet in a secure way e.g. using Secure Sockets Layer . A customer who purchases the Cloud Clock will be able to install and deploy the Cloud Clock in a few simple steps.

In some implementations the Cloud Clock is capable of restricting its operation within a geo fence. A geo fence can be a specified geographic boundary outside of which employees are not allowed to register time. The Cloud Clock can be configured to operate within a specified geo fence. The Cloud Clock includes an onboard Global Positioning System GPS that can be used to detect whether the Cloud Clock is or is not within the geo fence for authorized operation.

In some implementations the Cloud Clock can be used as a mobile check in and check out station that allows employees to punch in and punch out in cases where an employer requires its employees to punch in and out at an offsite location. For example road crews who need to meet at a job site can punch in at the Cloud Clock that is configured to operate within a geo fence encompassing the job site.

In an employee is shown as punching in or registering their time by presenting themselves in front of the camera and by flashing an identification ID card to the Cloud Clock . The display region displays a live video frame of the ID card that has been captured using the camera . Software running on the Cloud Clock can be configured to log in the employee by capturing a live video frame of the employee and the ID card using a front facing camera of the Cloud Clock and then processing the captured frame. The software and or hardware in the Cloud Clock can use a combination of image processing techniques and face recognition techniques to process the captured frame. As a result of the processing the Cloud Clock can read an ID code printed on the ID card . Further the Cloud Clock can identify the employee by recognizing the face of the employee . If the identified employee matches the employee associated with the ID code printed on the ID card the Cloud Clock can register the time entry for the employee as shown in .

The Cloud Clock is configured to read the ID card using a combination of image processing techniques. Once the ID card is read the Cloud Clock can process information printed on the ID e.g. a bar code or a QR code to register the time entry of an employee that presented the ID card . In the display region depicts a captured live video frame of an ID card . In some implementations the display region can display an authenticated icon indicating that the ID card has been authenticated.

In some implementations the image processing techniques include a bar code recognition process used to recognize one or two dimensional bar codes e.g. QR code printed on the ID card and captured in the video frame . As described in the employee can flash an ID card in front of the camera . The camera can capture a video frame of the face of the employee flashing the ID card . The image processing can be applied to at least a portion of the captured video frame that contains identifying information e.g. a code . One or more image processing operations can be performed to the captured video frame including but not limited to image binarization image tilt correction image orientation image geometric correction and image normalization. This image processing allows images to be collected under different illumination conditions different acquisition angles and allows employees to be quickly identified based on the ID codes printed on the ID cards.

The Cloud Clock is capable of capturing and storing an image of the employee that is registering their time. The captured image can be used for biometric employee authentication using various face recognition techniques. In some implementations face recognition processing can use one or more of the following face recognition verification processes Principal Component Analysis using eigenfaces Linear Discriminate Analysis Elastic Bunch Graph Matching using the Fisherface algorithm the Hidden Markov model and neuronal motivated dynamic link matching. In some implementations face recognition verification techniques e.g. supervised learning Viola Johns face detection can be used in a manner that adheres to the LFW Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark. The employee s captured image can be used in a photo audit trail as shown in .

The GUI also includes options for viewing time records e.g. timecards for a group of individuals in a team and also a timesheet dashboard for viewing multiple timesheets for a group of individuals in a team in one interface. The GUI also includes options for viewing items e.g. timesheets expenses time off requests that are pending approval. The GUI also includes options for viewing a history of items e.g. timesheets expenses time off requests .

The GUI displays photo audit trails for employees and . Each employee s photo audit trail includes respective time records e.g. times when the employee punched in or punched out and respective images of the employee that were taken at the time the employee punched in or punched out. For example a photo audit trail for employee William Jones displays time records 7 48 am 12 16 pm 12 44 pm and 5 00 pm and respective images taken of the employee at those times. Users can select e.g. using a mouse click or hover one of the respective images to view a larger version of the image as illustrated using the image for the time record

Users can select an option to select a time range for viewing time records e.g. times when the employee punched in or punched out within that time range. For example users can select a particular date as the time range and the GUI can display time records for employees for that particular date. The time range can be specified in other ways including a range within two times e.g. between 3 00 pm and 4 00 pm day of the week week month or year. Supervisors can review this photo audit trail as part of their routine to identify employees who have proxies punching in and out for them.

The name display field displays the name of the employee. The time display displays a time that will be used to register a time entry for the employee. The status display displays the employee s last time entry activity.

Using the interface the employee can select an option to punch in Clock In an option to view the employee s schedule View Schedule an option can be customized to perform a function to the employee s liking Custom an option to request time off Request Time Off and an option to view the hours the employee has worked View Hours Worked .

The timecard dashboard interface can also display one or more administrator options. In some implementations administrator options can include a check in option a check out option or a view history option. The check in option can be displayed when an employee that is scheduled for work on a given day has not punched in for the day. The check out option can be displayed when an employee has not punched out for the day. The view history option can be displayed when an employee that is scheduled for work on a given day has not punched in or punched out for the day. For example for employee the timecard dashboard interface displays a check out option Check out and a view history option History .

The timecard dashboard interface includes a button e.g. Previous and button e.g. Next for navigating the timecard dashboard interface . For example the button can be selected to view timecard information for a previous day e.g. Feb. 11 2011 and the button can be selected to view timecard information for a subsequent day e.g. Feb. 13 2011 . An administrator interacting with the timecard dashboard interface can scroll between timecard information for employees using scroll buttons and .
