Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to electromagnetic signal arrays and more particularly to apparatus for receiving and transmitting electromagnetic signals.

A Rotman lens may be used as a time delay beam former in an antenna array. Exemplary apparatus which may use a Rotman lens include electronically scanned antennas vehicle mounted satellite terminals or the like. Exemplary systems which may include such apparatus include radar systems satellite on the move or satellite on the go systems collision avoidance systems or the like. A conventional Rotman lens is large which can limit its use in portable equipment and may result in high losses due to high attenuation in the lens material and scattering in the lens structure.

Embodiments of the present invention include apparatus for receiving and transmitting electromagnetic signals. In some embodiments an apparatus includes a positive refractive index medium a negative refractive index medium having a first side and a second side disposed in the positive refractive index medium a plurality of first transmission lines each first transmission line having a first end extending toward the first side of the negative refractive index medium and a plurality of second transmission lines each second transmission line having a second end extending toward the second side of the negative refractive index medium wherein a plurality of electromagnetic signals each electromagnetic signal travelling in a first direction enters the positive refractive index medium and travels along the plurality of first transmissions lines and exits into the first side of the negative refractive index medium passes through the negative refractive index medium and exits through the second side of the negative refractive index medium into the positive refractive index medium along a first one of the plurality of second transmission lines.

In some embodiments an apparatus for receiving and transmitting signals includes a first plate a second plate a positive refractive index medium disposed between the first and second plates an negative refractive index medium having a first side and a second side disposed in the positive refractive index medium a electromagnetic bandgap material disposed in the positive refractive index medium on opposing ends of the negative refractive index medium to absorb stray electromagnetic signals which enter the negative refractive index medium through the first or second side of the negative refractive index medium a plurality of first transmission lines formed in the first plate each first transmission line having a first end extending toward the first side of the negative refractive index medium a plurality of first printed horns each first printed horn coupled to a corresponding first end of one of the plurality of first transmission lines a plurality of second transmission lines each second transmission line having a second end extending toward the second side of the negative refractive index medium a plurality of second printed horns each second printed horn coupled to a corresponding second end of one of the plurality of second transmission lines wherein a plurality of electromagnetic signals each electromagnetic signal travelling in a first direction enters the positive refractive index medium and travels along the pluralities of first transmissions lines and first printed horns and exits into the first side of the negative refractive index medium passes through the negative refractive index medium and exits through the second side of the negative refractive index medium into the positive refractive index medium along a first one of the plurality of second printed horns and a corresponding first one of the plurality of second transmission lines.

In some embodiments an electromagnetic bandgap material is disposed on opposing ends of the negative refractive index medium to absorb spilled electromagnetic signals that scatter in directions other than in the directions of the pluralities of first transmission lines and first printed horns and or the pluralities of second transmission lines and second printed horns respectively disposed adjacent to the first and second sides of the negative refractive index medium.

Embodiments of the present invention include apparatus for receiving and transmitting electromagnetic signals. Exemplary apparatus include an array for receiving and transmitting electromagnetic signals such as an array structure in the form of a Rotman lens or the like. The inventive apparatus advantageously reduces the size of the array for example by using a negative refractive index medium for at least a portion of the dielectric medium which may be used to form the lens. Further the reduced size of the array structure may reduce signal losses due to scattering along the path traversed by an electromagnetic signal such as through the lens material or through transmission lines of the array.

Inserted in the PRI medium may be a negative refractive index NRI medium having a first side and a second side . The NRI medium may operate as a lens portion of the apparatus . The NRI medium may comprise one or more artificial or engineered materials for example such as comprising one or more features disposed thereon or therein as illustrated in . Although drawn in as a one dimensional periodic pattern the one or more features may be distributed throughout the NRI medium in any suitable single or multi dimensional pattern than may be periodic or random. For example the one or more features may include one or more of printed loops printed probes printed metallic inserts or the like. Exemplary features may include one or more of split ring resonators capacitively coupled loops or lumped elements. For example the refractive index of the NRI medium may range between about 0.5 to about 4.0. In some embodiments the refractive index of the NRI medium can be greater than about 0.5 e.g. between about 0.5 to less than about 0.0. In some embodiment the refractive index of the NRI medium can be less than about 4.0. The refractive index of the negative refractive index medium may vary as a function of the dimensions of the one or more printed loops printed probes or printed metallic inserts. The negative refractive index medium may vary in thickness between the first side and second side . The negative refractive index medium may be constructed in any suitable manner such as using printed metallic inserts or the like or using nano structure inserts or the like to obtain a desired crystal structure.

The first side and the second side of the negative refractive index medium may have any desired radius of curvature such that in combination with other aspects of the apparatus a plurality of incident electromagnetic signals entering the phased array from the same direction are focused through the negative refractive index to a single outlet as discussed below and illustrated in . For example the first side and the second side of the negative refractive index medium may be a flat surface making the NRI medium a rectangular slab. Alternatively each side may have other radii.

The apparatus may include a plurality of first transmission lines wherein each first transmission line has a first end extending towards the first side of the negative refractive index medium as illustrated in . Each first end may be coupled to a printed antenna element or printed horn as discussed below and illustrated in . Each first transmission line may include a second end that may be connected to an element of the radiating phased array . The number of first transmission lines in the plurality may vary and their number represents the number of elements in the radiating phased array . Exemplary elements of the radiating phased array may include printed circuit elements patches dipoles or horns. The plurality of first transmission lines may vary in path length such that in combination with other aspects of the apparatus produce a phase front across the radiating phased array to radiate a beam in the direction corresponding to the beam position defined at an input of the apparatus at its opposite side defined by the beam ports .

A plurality of second transmission lines may be disposed adjacent to the second side of the negative refractive index medium . Each second transmission line may have a second end extending toward the second side of the negative refractive index medium as illustrated in . Each second transmission line may include an opposing end which may represent the beam port . As discussed below each second transmission line may include an antenna element or printed horn coupled to the second end as discussed below and illustrated in . The number of second transmission lines in the plurality may vary and may represent the number of beams formed by the apparatus . The path length may vary among the plurality of second transmission lines such that in combination with other aspects of the apparatus such as radius of curvature and the like discussed above that a plurality of electromagnetic signals that are being transmitted via a plurality of beam ports are incident on the plurality of second transmission lines from the same direction travel through the plurality of second transmission lines exiting at each second end and are refracted through the negative refractive index medium to produce a distribution across input elements connected at first ends of the plurality of first transmission lines . For example input elements may include antenna elements or printed horns coupled to each of the first ends of the first transmission lines as discussed below and illustrated in .

An electromagnetic bandgap material EBG may be disposed on opposing ends of the negative refractive index medium to absorb stray electromagnetic signals which enter the negative refractive index medium through the first or second sides of the negative refractive index medium . The electromagnetic bandgap material may be disposed in a cut out region of the PRI medium as illustrated in . For example stray electromagnetic signals may include any electromagnetic signals that enter the negative refractive index medium along the first or second transmission lines for example via printed antenna elements or printed horns coupled to the first or second transmission lines as discussed below that may not be directed towards a desired propagation direction. Stray electromagnetic signals from the plurality of electromagnetic signals that may not be directed towards the common second transmission line may be absorbed by the electromagnetic bandgap material . For example absorption by the electromagnetic bandgap material may limit stray electromagnetic signals from reaching the incorrect transmission line thus increasing signal noise and like. The electromagnetic bandgap material may comprise one or more sizes to operate over a wide bandwidth. Exemplary configurations that may be used for the electromagnetic bandgap structure include one or more of mushroom like patch array connected to a ground plane by conducting vias patch arrays without conducting vias or other suitable EBG configurations.

As illustrated in cross section view in the apparatus may include a first plate and a second plate wherein the PRI medium and the NRI medium are disposed between the first and second plates . Further as illustrated in the electromagnetic bandgap material may be disposed on opposing ends e.g. ends opposing the first and second transmission lines as illustrated in of the central region and at least partially between the first and second plates . The pluralities of first and second transmission lines and pluralities of first and second printed horns discussed below may be formed by the first plate . The first plate may be a continuous surface of metallic or conducting material having a geometry as described below. For example as illustrated in the first plate may be shaped in the form of first and second transmission lines . For example the first plate may include a plurality of first printed horns where each first printed horn may be coupled to a corresponding first end of one of the plurality of first transmission lines . Similarly the first plate may include a plurality of second printed horns where each second printed horn may be coupled to a corresponding second end of one of the plurality of second transmission lines . The first and second printed horns may be coupled to a central region of the first plate . For example the central region may be disposed above the NRI medium the PRI medium and coplanar with or slightly higher or lower than the upper surface of the electromagnetic bandgap material . The electromagnetic bandgap EBG material with an upper surface illustrated in may be utilized to absorb stray electromagnetic signals propagating through the NRI medium and PRI medium . As illustrated in the upper surface of the EBG material may be patterned for example such as including one or more printed patches situated above a ground plane e.g. second plate and connected to the ground plane with a pin or via . The printed patches may be patterned as squares as illustrated in hexagons or other shapes. Although illustrated in as having the same dimensions the one or more printed patches may have the same or varying dimensions. For example in some embodiments at least one of the one or more printed patches may have a different dimension than at least another of the one or more printed patches.

The second plate may be separated from the first plate by the PRI medium and NRI medium . The second plate may be a continuous surface of metallic or conducting material. The first and second plates may comprise one or more of aluminum Al gold Au copper Cu or the like. While illustrated as rectangular in the first and second plates may be any suitable outside shape such as square circular polyhedron irregularly shaped or the like.

The apparatus may be used to receive or transmit electromagnetic signals as illustrated in . For example illustrate embodiments of the apparatus where a plurality of electromagnetic signals is received by the plurality of first transmission lines connected to the receiving phased array . Similarly illustrate embodiments of the apparatus where an electromagnetic signal is transmitted by the plurality of first transmission lines connected to the radiating phased array . As used herein an electromagnetic signal may refer to continuous or modulated waves or wave packets or the like.

For example illustrates the apparatus having a plurality of electromagnetic signals incident on the plurality of first transmission lines . As illustrated each electromagnetic signal may be travelling in a first direction where the first direction may be defined by an angle between a signal front and a plane that contains the phased array . The signal collimates along a first one of the plurality of second transmission lines . As partially illustrated in the plurality of electromagnetic signals travels through the PRI medium along the plurality of first transmission lines and the plurality of first printed horns to the first side of the NRI medium . The plurality of electromagnetic signals passes through the negative refractive index medium and exits through the second side of the negative refractive index medium into the PRI medium along the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines and corresponding second printed horn to one beam port coupled to the opposing end of the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines .

For example in some embodiments the plurality of electromagnetic signals may comprise a first plurality of first electromagnetic signals and a second plurality of second electromagnetic signals wherein each first electromagnetic signal has a first frequency and is travelling in the first direction and each second electromagnetic signal has a second frequency different from the first frequency and is travelling in the first direction . In such embodiments both the first plurality of first electromagnetic signals and the second plurality of electromagnetic signals are focused through the negative refractive index medium to a common second transmission lines such as the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines as illustrated in .

In some embodiments a plurality of electromagnetic signals may be incident on the apparatus from a second direction different from the first direction . For example as illustrated in the apparatus may have a plurality of second electromagnetic signals incident on the apparatus from the second direction . As illustrated each second electromagnetic signal may be travelling in the second direction where the second direction may be defined by an angle between a signal front and the plane that contains the phased array . The signal collimates at a second one of the plurality of second transmission lines . As illustrated in the plurality of second electromagnetic signals enters the PRI medium along the plurality of first transmission lines and plurality of first printed horns to the first side of the negative refractive index medium . The plurality of electromagnetic signals passes through the negative refractive index medium and exits through the second side of the negative refractive index medium into the PRI medium along the second one of the plurality of second transmission lines and corresponding second printed horn to one beam port coupled to the opposing end of the second one of the plurality of second transmission lines .

For example in some embodiments because of the first direction may be different from the second direction the plurality of electromagnetic signals may be focused to the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines and the plurality of second electromagnetic signals may be focused to the second one different from the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines . For example focusing may be dependent on direction e.g. the first and second directions and independent of frequency. For example each electromagnetic signal and each second electromagnetic signal may have the same frequency or different frequencies and the behavior illustrated in and discussed above may still hold.

The apparatus may be used to transmit electromagnetic signals as illustrated in . For example as illustrated in a first electromagnetic signal may enter the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines at an end e.g. at a beam port or the like . The first electromagnetic signal may travel through the PRI medium along the first one of the plurality of second transmission lines and a corresponding one of the plurality of second printed horns and exits the PRI medium into the second side of the negative refractive index medium . The first electromagnetic signal may be dispersed by the NRI medium into the plurality of electromagnetic signals which exit through the first side of the NRI medium into the PRI medium along the plurality of first transmission lines and corresponding plurality of first printed horns . The plurality of electromagnetic signals can exit the array through the radiating phased array elements that may be coupled to each second end of each of the plurality of first transmission lines travelling in the first direction defined by the angle between the plane of the radiating phased array and the plane of the radiated signals.

In some embodiments the first electromagnetic signal may comprise a first electromagnetic signal at a first frequency and a second electromagnetic signal at a second frequency different from the first frequency and the plurality of electromagnetic signals may comprise a first plurality of electromagnetic signals at the first frequency and a second plurality of electromagnetic signals at the second frequency.

For example as illustrated in a second electromagnetic signal may enter the second one of the plurality of second transmission lines at an end . The second electromagnetic signal may travel through the PRI medium along the second one of the plurality of second transmission lines and corresponding one of the plurality of second printed horns and exit the PRI medium into the second side of the negative refractive index medium . The second electromagnetic signal may be dispersed by the NRI medium into the plurality of second electromagnetic signals which exit through the first side of the medium into the PRI medium along the plurality of first transmission lines and corresponding plurality of first printed horns . The plurality of second electromagnetic signals can exit the apparatus through the radiating phased array elements that terminate at each second end of each of the plurality of first transmission lines travelling in the second direction defined by the angle between the plane of the radiating phased array and the plane of the radiated signals. For example the first electromagnetic signal and the second electromagnetic signal may have the same frequency or different frequencies and the behavior illustrated in and discussed above may still hold.
