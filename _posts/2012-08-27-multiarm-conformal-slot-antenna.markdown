title: Multi-arm conformal slot antenna
abstract: An octave bandwidth conformal cavity-backed slot antenna includes a ground plane with a number of different length slits that come together at the central feedpoint. The slit length varies from one-half a wavelength at the highest frequency at which the antenna is to operate for the short side to one wavelength at the highest frequency for the long side, with the proximal ends of the slits having a common feedpoint. Such slot antennas may be arrayed in a quad configuration. Because the trapezoidal envelope of the antenna induces the phase-center to shift with frequency, when two are arrayed with short sides adjacent, the spacing between them results in a phase center from one antenna to the next that is effectively within half a wavelength at all frequencies.

This Application claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 527 760 filed Aug. 26 2011 the contents of which are incorporate herein by reference.

The invention claimed in this patent application was made with U.S. Government support under contract no. F33657 91 C 0006 awarded by the Aeronautical Systems Center. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to conformal antennas slot antennas antenna arrays and more specifically to a quad array of multi arm slot antennas.

Aircraft and other vehicles are commonly provided with cavity backed slot antennas which in general involve a slot through a ground plane. These cavity backed slot antennas are by their very nature narrow banded and it is only with difficulty that one can increase the bandwidth of the slot antenna so that it may be used over a wide frequency range for detection of multiple transmitters. Wide bandwidth slots support for instance direction finding involving angle of arrivals AOA determinations and radar warning systems. Unlike horn and spiral antennas slots can be spaced within a half wavelength to allow unambiguous phase determination beamforming and sidelobe control.

Moreover it is desirable to provide an S band or an L band conformal slot antenna for high power communications. In general slots may be scaled dimensionally to support systems of various mission needs. Combining ultra wide bandwidth with the scalability and phase control of slot arrays allows them to be used with the most demanding radar and communications signal receiving electronic warfare receivers and transmitters.

The slot is cut or etched into a metallic ground plane which may be shaped to conform to the smoothly curving surface of an aircraft or other platform thus being described as conformal.

In the past one way to obtain greater bandwidth was to attempt to increase the width of the slot. However the result is a wide open wave guide cavity. The problem with such a wide slot is an intolerable radar cross section that would cause a stealthy platform to be susceptible to illumination by enemy radars.

Another application that was attempted was to create an array of four slots in a square arrangement so that the resulting antenna would not only have a broader bandwidth but also would behave like a monopole extending out of the surface of the ground plane. If the four slots were fed together in phase while one would achieve a monopole behavior the bandwidth would nonetheless be limited by the bandwidth associated with the slots. Other feed arrangements for the square array allow diversity of polarization or direction finding. However these also would be of limited application if the slot bandwidth could not be extended.

The challenge was to come up with a way to make a fat slot but with the fat slot mostly covered up so as not to present a large structural radar cross section. Moreover there needed to be a way to fit the slots in a square array without the wide fat slots overlapping.

In short a topology needed to be developed that would provide a 2 1 or 3 1 bandwidth without significantly increasing the platform s radar cross section and to do so with conformal antenna apertures usable on the skin of aircraft or other vehicles.

In summary there is a conflict between close spacing and minimum length and width for slot antennas in a quad array. Close half wavelength spacing or less is required element to element at highest frequencies i.e. short wavelengths but the length of elements must be half wavelength at low frequencies long wavelengths for efficient performance. Also each element must be wide enough to achieve bandwidth. Additionally the radar cross section of the conformal aperture must be minimized. A need therefore exists for wide instantaneous bandwidth 3 1 conformal slot apertures capable of handling high power and of being arrayed in a quad configuration for 360 degree azimuthal coverage.

According to the present invention a wide bandwidth conformal cavity backed slot antenna is comprised of multiple arms in the form of slits that connect at a feedpoint to form a multi armed slot that behaves as a single slot antenna. In one embodiment each multi arm slot antenna includes two opposed multi slit back to back pitchforked shapes with each pitchfork having at least three slits of decreasing length with the proximal ends of the slits connected at a feedpoint. The ends of the slits define a trapezoidal envelope due to their decreasing lengths across the width of the antenna. The slits loosely resemble either a spider or pitchfork tines that extend from a lateral support.

It has been found that the width of the pitchfork antenna from short slit to long slit must be no greater than 4 at the highest frequency for which the antenna is designed. If this width is over 4 then the performance is severely degraded to point of inoperability. Moreover for a 2 1 bandwidth the overall length of the shortest slits is 2 for the highest frequency whereas the overall length of the longest slits are one wavelength at the highest frequency. Thus the ratio of the lengths of the short side to the long side is 2 1.

In summary the pitchfork embodiment the slits or arms increase in length from one side of the antenna element to the other with the overall length of the longest slits corresponding to one wavelength at the highest frequency at which the antenna is to operate and with the overall length of the shortest slits corresponding to one half wavelength at the highest frequency. The multi arm slot is designed to have a phase center that moves toward the shortest arms with increasing frequency. Without loading this multi arm slot configuration achieves a 2 1 bandwidth.

According to an improved embodiment of the multi arm slot antenna the distal ends of the slits are loaded in order to prevent higher level modes and the slits are tapered wider toward the distal ends. Further a balun feed structure is added within the cavity to match or offset reactive impedances inherent to the slot. This combination of enhancements enables extension of the RF bandwidth to 3 1.

To establish monopole like performance four multi arm slot antennas are arrayed at 90 degrees relative to each other in a square to form a quad slot array. This square arrangement made possible due to the trapezoidal envelope of the antenna elements may be altered into a rhombus to reduce the tendency of the square array to reflect higher frequency incoming radar signals back to their source. The trapezoidal envelope of the array element slit lengths may be canted to better fit into the rhombus array configuration to align with platform edges of an aircraft.

In summary an octave bandwidth conformal cavity backed slot antenna includes a ground plane with a number of different length slits that come together at the central feedpoint. The slit length varies from one half a wavelength at the highest frequency at which the antenna is to operate for the short side to one wavelength at the highest frequency for the long side with the proximal ends of the slits having a common feedpoint. Such slot antennas may be arrayed in a quad configuration. Because the trapezoidal envelope of the antenna induces the phase center to shift with frequency when two are arrayed with short sides adjacent the spacing between them results in a phase center from one antenna to the next that is effectively within half a wavelength at all frequencies. Furthermore also due to the trapezoidal envelope four multi arm slots may be arrayed in a square configuration without exceeding the half wavelength array spacing requirement for the phase centers. Extended low frequency bandwidth is provided by either magnetically or resistively loading the distal ends of selected slits and the use of an ultra wideband balun.

A multi arm slot implementation is disclosed that can achieve wide instantaneous bandwidth 3 1 using conformal antenna apertures. These conformed multi arm antenna are capable of handling high power and of being arrayed in a quad configuration for 360 degree azimuthal coverage. This coverage can support Electronic Warfare Direction Finding DF Communications and other applications. The conformal surface is particularly useful for airborne and other mobile platforms. According to one embodiment the multi arm slot may result in high effective radiated power in a transmit configuration and increased electronic surveillance measurement sensitivity while being compatible with low complexity arctangent DF implementations. In other embodiments the slots may be arrayed for increased gain beam forming and side lobe control.

According to one embodiment the array uses multiple narrow slits fed in parallel to broaden bandwidth relative to a single narrowband slot design. The multi arm geometry is chosen such that the radiating portion of the antenna is close to half wavelength for efficient operation maintaining a nominal cosine radiation pattern. Narrow slits minimize structural scattering of incident radar signals. Each multi arm slot in a quad array may optionally have its own cavity backing thus allowing greater structural support.

Referring now to the prior art a typical cavity backed slot antenna includes a slot through the surface of for instance the skin of an aircraft. It is noted that a cavity shown in dotted outline is placed in back of the slot for containing radiation that is projected into the aircraft or behind the skin of the vehicle and controlling the slot s electrical parameter of input impedance. It will be appreciated that the slot antenna shown in is a narrow band antenna. The bandwidth is proportional to the width of the slot shown by double ended arrow . As mentioned hereinbefore while the slot may be fattened the problem for some platforms is intolerable radar cross section which exposes a low observable aircraft or other vehicle to detection by enemy radar.

Referring now to in order for the provision of a slot antenna of for instance a 2 1 bandwidth the slot antenna of is converted into a multi armed slot antenna in which antenna is composed of a ground plane with connecting slits with the slits forming multiple arms all fitting within a trapezoidal envelope afforded by the decreasing length of the slits in the illustrated embodiment.

As illustrated the longest arms and have an overall length of one wavelength at the highest frequency. Alternatively for a 2 1 bandwidth the overall length of the longest arms can be set to one half wavelength at the lowest frequency of operation. Intermediate arms and are shorter than arms and corresponding to an intermediate frequency. In order to accommodate the highest frequency arms and are shortened such that their overall length corresponds to a half the wavelength at the highest frequency.

It will be seen that all of the arms are connected together by backbone slits and with a feedpoint being in the form of a slit that runs between slits and . It is this feedpoint slit that is driven diagrammatically by a coaxial cable which has its center conductor coupled to one side of slit and with its exterior shield grounded to the ground plane here illustrated at .

What will be appreciated from viewing antenna is that the cavity backed slot antenna is formed within a ground plane by slits and . These slits are interconnected by slits and . Moreover it will be appreciated that the slits that form the arms may be tapered wider towards the ends of the arms to provide for better input impedance versus frequency.

Importantly the width of the antenna from short slits to long slits is shown by arrow which must be kept under 4 at the highest frequency. This is a critical dimension over which the antenna ceases to operate effectively due to higher order modes.

The antenna shown in is capable of providing a 2 1 bandwidth for a receiver or transmitter. However by adding magnetic loading strips to the distal ends of the shorter arms and resistive loading strips at the distal ends of the longer arms a 3 1 bandwidth is achievable with this multi arm structure assisted by the addition of a customized balun which may feed the slot from within the cavity below it.

Note also that the bandwidth is increased markedly over the slot antenna of without having to utilize fat slots or open ended waveguide that increase the structural radar cross section.

The antenna of is shown diagrammatically in oriented in a vertical plane which is typically located on the side of an aircraft on the skin thereof and when arrayed can provide the equivalent of a monopole antenna extending outwardly from plane with the arms indicated by the associated reference characters.

In order to provide for the aforementioned monopole performance in one embodiment a quad slot array is shown in in which four multi arm slot antennas of the type described in are set into ground plane with feedpoints opposed as illustrated. The result is a quad arrangement of four cavity backed slot antennas that fit into a square. The first antenna shown here at is opposed to antenna with antenna opposed to antenna . For convenience the coaxial cable feed may come to the center of the array where its outer shield is connected to the ground plane . The center conductor is connected in parallel to the feedpoints in parallel using strip lines which run under the ground plane and are connected to respective feedpoints using vias .

It will be seen that antennas are contained within a square area such that the length across any square dimension is equal to or less than one half wavelength at the lowest frequency at which the antenna is to operate.

Referring again to one embodiment of a multi arm slot geometry is shown. This geometry utilizes three slit radiators with end loading applied to extend the basic frequency range lower to achieve a nominal 3 1 bandwidth. Thus the geometry can be selected such that the radiating portion is no more than half wavelength for good radiation efficiency. The element loading may be incorporated across the longest and shortest arms prevents higher order modes that would be present otherwise in the extended frequency range. The higher order modes can cause poor radiation efficiency within a 3 1 bandwidth and distort the nominal cosine pattern impacting the broadband gain and phase and thus increasing DF error. However 2 1 bandwidth may be achieved without loading. In the embodiment shown in the shortest arms are magnetically loaded while the longest arms are resistively loaded.

Referring to the elevation and azimuth patterns for an L band multi arm slot are shown respectively. These monopole radiation patterns are produced by the quad slot array when all elements are fed in phase. The weaker patterns of are cross polarized.

Referring now to the mean swept gain over 360 degrees azimuth at 80 10 degrees above the horizon is shown. This mean swept gain is for an L band and S band multi arm quad slot aperture demonstrating the gain response. In one embodiment utilizing 50 W capable terminations within the longest arms one S band multi arm element was successfully tested to 50 W Average 100 W Peak. Thus the quad aperture is capable of 200 W Avg 400 W Peak.

Referring to the vertical polarization V pol azimuth angle of arrival can be found with a 90 degree ambiguity using a simple Arctangent algorithm by computing 

If the elements are ideal cosine patterns this yields AOA vs. with a Sin 2 function. Practically there is pattern distortion which can be calibrated using a simple look up table. The measured element and sum patterns and their phase response vs. AOA for the L Band quad slot antenna at 1 GHz are shown in .

Referring to the calibrated and uncalibrated AOA error is shown at 0 10 and 20 degrees elevation using 10 degree elevation data as the calibration data. This graph demonstrates both a 3 1 DF bandwidth and minimal sensitivity to calibration in elevation for near grazing angle incidence.

Many different configurations of the multi arm conformal slot antenna are possible. Referring to one possible configuration is shown. Here two of the multi arm conformal slot antennas of Figure N are skewed or canted on their own separate ground planes as illustrated by antennas and . These face a pair of oppositely skewed antennas on their own ground plane. The antennas are fed in parallel as illustrated.

Referring to another configuration shows slot antennas skewed with respect to each other and fed in parallel.

Referring to rather than using the pitchfork configuration for the arms previously illustrated a spider pattern for the slits may be used revealing design flexibility within the trapezoidal envelope. Here a 2 1 bandwidth is achievable with the length of the long side being twice that of the short side .

Referring to a quad array of spider cavity backed slot antennas is shown. These pairs of spider antennas are shown opposed with the feedpoints fed from the center conductor of the coaxial feed as shown by strip lines .

For the slot embodiment of improved bandwidth is accomplished through applying a slot line balun feed to the multi arm conformal antenna and optimizing slot geometry. Referring now to an ultra wideband balun is shown having an extension from a 50 ohm coaxial input transmission line . The center conductor of the coaxial cable extends up through extension to a junction between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines.

This junction is located in a dielectric substrate with a stripline on the inside not shown and a metallic slab or plating on the outside of the substrate.

At junction wire lead connects to the center strip of the stripline at which an open circuited quarter wave stripline stub exists that is connected in series with a short circuited transmission line and a tapered balanced transmission line of balun . It is noted that short circuited transmission line comprises two slabs extending from junction down to a metal end wall with dielectric material removed from the gap. Short circuited transmission line presents a high impedance as connected in parallel to tapered balanced transmission line causing greater signal power to flow on the tapered slotline . It is noted that transmission line leads up to a connection point that gets affixed to the feedpoint of the slot which is on a separate stripline board perpendicular to this balun. The tapered slot balanced transmission line smoothly transfers the characteristic impedance from a nominal 100 ohms to approximately 200 ohms.

It is noted that the impedance of the slot feedpoint is nominal and actually varies with frequency. The off center frequency reactance of the balun is designed to match that of the slot at the extremes of the 3 1 band. As a result balun serves to provide an ultra wideband impedance matching element for the subject antennas.

While the present invention is described in connection with preferred embodiments it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiments for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment.
