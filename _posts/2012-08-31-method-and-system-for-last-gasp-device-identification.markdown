The present invention generally relates to network device support and more particularly to a method and system for last gasp device identification.

Wireless communications systems are used in a variety of telecommunications systems television radio and other media systems data communication networks and other systems to convey information between remote points using wireless transmitters and wireless receivers. A transmitter is an electronic device that usually with the aid of an antenna propagates an electromagnetic signal modulated with information such as radio television or other signals. A receiver is an electronic device that receives a wireless electromagnetic signal and processes the information modulated thereon. A transmitter and receiver may be combined into a single device called a transceiver.

Machine to machine M2M communications in large industrial networks may require the connection of over 30 000 machine User Equipment UE devices per cell. Long Term Evolution LTE and or Long Term Evolution Advanced LTE A networks may be used for fourth generation 4G wireless technology communication used to provide communication between and or among all UEs and a base station e.g. Evolved Node B eNB .

The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of at least the features elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to of the drawings like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.

As used herein base station may refer to a transmission site a remote transmission site a Radio Element Control an Evolved Node B eNB a Baseband Unit a Radio Element and or a Remote Radio Head RRH . Base station may include any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for wired or wireless exchange of information in network . Base station may be operable to send control signals and data traffic to endpoints . Base station may use any suitable technologies or protocols e.g. Common Public Radio Interface CPRI to communicate with other base stations .

Base station may also be coupled to any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals data and or messages including signals data or messages transmitted through WebPages e mail text chat voice over IP VoIP and instant messaging in order to provide services and data to endpoints . For example base station may be coupled to one or more local area networks LANs wide area networks WANs metropolitan area networks MANs public switched telephone networks PSTNs worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX networks global distributed networks such as the Internet or any other form of wireless or wired networking. As an example base station may be coupled to a core infrastructure network which may include server via a LAN .

Base station may communicate with endpoints using wireless communication via one or more ports not expressly shown . Base station may communicate with endpoints using any suitable wireless technology including but not limited to Long Term Evolution LTE or Long Term Evolution Advanced LTE A protocols. In some embodiments base station may coordinate with other base stations to communicate jointly with endpoint .

Endpoint may be any type of wireless device able to send and receive data and or signals to and from other endpoints base station directly and or base station via one or more other base stations . Some examples of endpoints include desktop computers PDAs cell phones laptops VoIP phones wireless measurement devices wireless sensors and or Machine User Equipment UE . Endpoints may provide data or network services to a human and or machine user through any suitable combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium real time processing system and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . Endpoints may also include unattended or automated systems gateways other intermediate components or other devices that may send or receive data and or signals. Various types of information may be sent to or from endpoints . As an example endpoint may send identification data and status data to base station .

Network may have been initially designated for human use. However M2M communications also known as Machine Type Communications MTC may have emerged as market driven class of applications. M2M traffic patterns may be significantly different from human mobile traffic. During M2M mass event scenarios e.g. after a power outage scenario impacting most or all endpoints connected to base station the related network may be overloaded when the mass event resolves e.g. power is returned. Additionally network may be unable to identify particular endpoints that are involved in the mass event. In order to allow network to properly process mass triggered machine events last gasp function may be employed for some endpoints as the capability of endpoints to emit one last message when it loses power.

Further network and base station may be required to accommodate large numbers of endpoints in the form of machine UE devices e.g. up to more than approximately 30 000 devices per cell . For example sensor networks in industrial applications smart grid meters in residential utility applications and or smart home networks may include large numbers of endpoints . Network may include only machine UE devices in the case of a M2M network or network may be a mix of human UE devices and machine UE devices in a human machine network. During power outages or other mass event scenarios endpoints may be impacted and may lose power. Endpoints may generate transmission of a last message e.g. last gasp message LGM . The LGM may be sent immediately after a power loss or other mass scale event. The LGM may be transmitted within a last gasp LG interval of approximately 50 ms to 500 ms immediately after the power outage or other mass scale event occurs. The LGM may include information indicating that the power outage or other mass scale event has occurred e.g. that endpoint has experienced a power loss or other mass scale event.

The LGM transmitted by endpoint may be sent using a Random Access Channel RACH and or a Physical Random Access Channel PRACH . A PRACH may be a shared channel used for initial communication between endpoint and base station and for communication of unscheduled messages such as when endpoint exits sleep mode loses power or executes a handover. Thus for example a PRACH may be used to transmit a LGM from endpoint to base station across and or utilizing an LTE or LTE A network. If endpoint is unable to transmit a LGM following a power outage or other mass scale event base station may be unaware that a particular endpoint is no longer connected to the network and possibly not operating. Additionally when recovering from mass event scenarios involving large numbers of endpoints the access channel including a RACH or PRACH may be overloaded e.g. when power returns due to a large number of LGM endpoints which in turn will be attempting to contact base station simultaneously . If the PRACH becomes overloaded when power is restored to endpoints then signals sent from endpoints attempting to reconnect to base station may collide and some or most endpoints may be unable to connect to network .

In some embodiments predefined endpoints may communicate and transmit signals to a primary endpoint also called a PRACH group candidate. The communication between predefined endpoints and the PRACH group candidate may occur using a different wireless technology and or network than the technology and or network designed to communicate between endpoints and base station . The PRACH group candidate may utilize the PRACH to communicate information regarding all predefined endpoints to base station . While this group access may reduce traffic across the PRACH between endpoints and base station endpoints may have a higher cost because they may be required to support multiple communication technologies e.g. support for communication with the PRACH group candidate and communication with base station .

System may allow for multiple input multiple output MIMO transmission where multiple antennas are used for transmitting and receiving wireless signals. Additionally system may be configured to perform Coordinated Multi point Processing CoMP to coordinate and combine the transmission of signals used in MIMO transmission. The CoMP processing may perform down link DL CoMP transmission in which multiple base units jointly communicate with endpoints and or multiple endpoints communicate with base unit .

Endpoints may communicate with base station using wireless communication via one or more antenna ports . For example endpoint may communicate with base station via antenna ports and . Endpoint may communicate with base station via antenna ports and . Endpoints may communicate with base station using any of a variety of different wireless technologies including but not limited to orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA LTE and LTE A protocol as defined in the Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Release 11 or beyond. In some embodiments of the present disclosure endpoint may coordinate with one more other endpoints to communicate jointly with base station . In such embodiments endpoints may coordinate with each other to communicate with base station using a MIMO transmission scheme where multiple transmitting antenna ports are placed at different endpoints while one or more receiving antenna port are located at the base station .

For example endpoints may communicate with base station using a DL CoMP MIMO transmission as defined in 3GPP Release 11 or beyond. During such a MIMO transmission endpoint may wirelessly communicate a portion of a data stream to base station via one or more wireless connections between antenna ports and one or more antenna port of base station .

Accordingly the above mentioned components of endpoints and base station may enable endpoints and base station to perform operations such as joint DL transmission according to the present disclosure. Modifications additions or omissions may be made to without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example any of the options or features described herein may be utilized in combination with the illustrated embodiments of and or any number of the other options or features also described herein as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. As another example base station may include a real time physical PHY layer processor coupled to a fast access RAM and a permanent ROM memory. The real time PHY processor may be configured to process a plurality of signals stored into one or more subframes received from one or more endpoints .

In embodiments of the present disclosure antenna system may be a M2M sensor network e.g. a smart grid . The M2M network may have the characteristics of being fixed or portable such that some endpoints may have no mobility attributes. The M2M network may be AC powered and may exhibit infrequent and or bursty communication and traffic patterns. As signals are sent across channels the expected Time of Arrival ToA may be less than 5 seconds. As more endpoints are added to an M2M network a dedicated LTE or LTE A network may be necessitated. When a mass scale event occurs e.g. power outage many endpoints may be disconnected from system . As endpoint loses AC power endpoint may send a LGM during the LG interval between approximately 20 and 500 ms after power loss or other mass scale event. The LG interval may also be called LGM duration or indicated by LGM. The LG interval may average 200 ms.

As a consequence base station may employ a system and method triggered by the LGM to detect that endpoints have experienced an event causing a LGM and then further identify the number location and or type of endpoints affected by the mass scale event in order to take any appropriate remedial steps. A power outage or other mass scale event with a longer duration may allow base station to identify more accurately aspects of endpoint . A short duration of a mass event such a power outage may limit base station identification of all aspects of endpoint . Remedial steps taken by base station may include preparing for recovery rerouting signals and or any other appropriate remedial measure. Thus as discussed in detail below and in embodiments of the present disclosure a load cognitive PRACH algorithm may be employed that includes LGM detection LGM device identification and M2M LGM PRACH access optimization upon recovery. Specifically LGM detection will be described in more detail in association with and LGM device identification will be described in more detail in association with .

In some embodiments following detection of an LGM the M2M network may further identify the LGM devices utilizing the LGM time and corresponding Time Advancing TA zones that may be based on the locations of the LGM devices. The selection of TA zones may depend on the power outage or other mass event duration. When the LGM devices may be ready to reconnect to the network the network may schedule and perform a contention free random access targeting procedure. In this procedure the LGM devices may attempt to access the network and may be unsuccessful. If the LGM device is unsuccessful it may utilize a scheduled contention free opportunity.

Generally M2M devices e.g. endpoints operating in a dedicated LTE M2M network may execute two types of access to an eNB e.g. base station . A first type of access may be termed random access RA procedure including a random access channel RACH backed by a PRACH based access on the physical PHY layer. An RA procedure may be utilized when endpoint connects to the base station . Transmissions may include for example scheduled transmissions of data following the exit of isle or sleep mode or powering on by a user or after an accidental power failure. Thus the RA procedure may target initial access synchronization following idle sleep mode and or handover HO procedures. Before the RA procedure begins endpoints may be in an initial status that may be either RRC IDLE status e.g. when endpoint may be in sleep mode to conserve power or NOT CONNECTED status e.g. when endpoint may be powered down or removed from the network temporarily. Endpoints subject to an RA procedure may migrate from either RRC IDLE status or NOT CONNECTED status to RRC CONNECTED status e.g. when endpoint may be connected and or transmitting information from the LTE network perspective. The second type of access may be termed LGM PRACH access. When a LGM enabled device is subject to a power outage or other mass scale event a LGM PRACH access procedure may be triggered. Devices starting a LGM PRACH access procedure may be in an RRC IDLE state. In some embodiments as endpoints communicate with base station 64 preamble signatures may be processed by base station within one PRACH subframe.

While RA procedure may include a complete four step procedure ending with a contention resolution signal resolution the LGM PRACH access procedure may not include all four steps due to the expected short duration of the LG interval average of 200 ms. For example the LG interval may end before the RA procedure completes. Thus endpoint may not be able to connect to base station or re synchronize with base station . In some embodiments endpoint may not complete resolution and or may not be able to complete any steps beyond transmission . Thus the LGM PRACH access procedure may include endpoints that may not complete the full RA procedure.

Accordingly illustrate example LGM PRACH access procedures that may enable detection of endpoints that may have experienced a power loss or other mass scale event. Hence illustrates an example LGM PRACH procedure utilizing new preamble Group C in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. LGM PRACH procedure may occur immediately after a power loss or other mass scale event for all or a subset of endpoints in network shown in . In some embodiments LGM PRACH procedure may start with endpoint to send a LGM as endpoint powers down immediately following a power loss or other mass scale event. In LGM PRACH procedure a new Group C of preamble signatures may be defined to support a LGM. In one embodiment Group C signatures may be allocated from the same 64 signatures discussed with respect to Groups A and B in . Group C signatures may not affect the underlying PRACH PHY or L preamble signals from endpoint . LGM PRACH procedure may be suited for M2M networks mixed machine human networks and or other suitable network configurations and protocols.

LGM PRACH procedure may begin with transmission that may include a PRACH Group C Preamble L signal communicated from endpoint to base station immediately after a power loss or other mass scale event experienced by endpoint . Group C signatures may originate from the overall pool of preamble signatures which in one embodiment is 64 signatures. Group C signatures may include a minimum of two signatures leaving a maximum of 62 signatures for distribution between Groups A and B. However the number of signatures in Groups A B and C may vary up to a combined total of 64 signatures.

Base station may respond to endpoint with response . Response may include an RAR backed by L L signaling. Endpoint may utilize a reduced BI in LGM PRACH procedure . In some embodiments the reduced BI may be approximately 128 ms or less. The reduced BI may apply only to Group C preambles which may be the LGM dedicated signatures. The reduced BI may be employed to accommodate the average LGM duration of 200 ms. This reduced BI may increase the chances a LGM device e.g. endpoint may access the PRACH for a second time using Group C of preambles. Additionally the BI interval may allow base station to increase the amount of dedicated Group C signatures. Following a positive RAR transmitted by bases station to endpoint endpoint may respond back to base station with message . Message may also be called Message . Message may include a Scheduled Transmission Message. Message may also include L L and L signaling. Message may include the identification e.g. a random network temporary identifier C RNTI of endpoint . The C RNTI information may allow base station to recognize endpoint . In some embodiments message may include a LGM status.

While RA procedure shown in may include four steps ending with resolution LGM PRACH procedure may not complete four steps due to the expected short duration of the LG interval average of 200 ms. In one embodiment endpoint may not complete contention resolution with resolution . Moreover in heavy contention cases endpoint may not be identified by base station following a successful reception of message by base station .

Accordingly in some embodiments due to limited time constraints a successful transmission of message may not occur. If message is received but not decoded and the amount of collisions computed over PRACH Group C exceeds a certain threshold the network may conclude that a power outage or other mass scale event occurred and at least some of endpoints may no longer be connected to the wireless network e.g. network of . In the illustrated embodiment transmission may have been detected and received by base station . The received information may be transmitted to a server such as server of and or other suitable device for subsequent processing and or transmission information may be processed locally at base station .

In some embodiments in order to increase the chances one or more endpoints may be detected and or identified the allocation of signatures to the PRACH Group C may be dynamically adjusted. Dynamic adjustment of PRACH Group C signatures may allow base station to detect and or identify as many possible endpoints . As noted above the BI e.g. the predefined time delay before endpoint sends an additional PRACH transmission following receipt of a negative RAR may be reduced to approximately 128 ms or less to allow up to two PRACH Group C preamble transmissions from endpoint to base station during the LG interval. Multiple PRACH Group C preamble transmissions based on multiple transmissions from multiple endpoints may result in signal collisions at base station . Signal collisions may occur if a signal is transmitted from endpoint but cannot be properly decoded because multiple endpoints may have selected the same preamble signature at the same time. If base station determines the PRACH Group C collision rate defined as P Group C is above a predefined allowable collision rate defined as base station may conclude that a power outage or other mass scale event impacting one or more endpoints from the coverage area e.g. cell shown in may have occurred. As a result base station may attempt to increase the size of PRACH Group C preamble opportunities as quickly as possible to the allowed maximum size and or within the maximum allowed time. In some embodiments the time allowed for PRACH Group C expansion defined as T may be a function of the LGM duration. For example T

Further in some embodiments a timer T may be inserted following the PRACH Group C size being increased to the maximum. T may be employed before base station may reduce Preamble Group C back to normal size and or after the collision rate of Preamble Group C is below the predefined allowable collision rate. The duration of T may be established according to demands of a specific implementation and or may be determined experimentally. In one embodiment utilizing a timer may avoid multiple variations of collision rates due to possible inaccuracies in measuring the collision rate of Group C signals.

 i Base station detects that the rate of PRACH Group C collisions is below a predefined allowable rate of collisions P Group C 

The rate of PRACH Group C collisions may be determined by the ratio of the number of PRACH Group C collisions and the PRACH Group C capacity 

LGM PRACH procedure may begin with transmission that may include a LGM Group B Preamble L signal communicated from endpoint to base station immediately after a power loss or other mass scale event experienced by endpoint . Group B signatures may originate from the overall pool of preamble signatures which in one embodiment includes 64 signatures. Group B may include a minimum of two signatures of the overall signatures of the PRACH subframe which may leave a maximum of 62 signatures for Group A. However the number of signatures in Groups A and B may vary up to the combined total of 64 signatures.

Base station may respond to endpoint with response that may include a RAR backed by L L signaling. Endpoint may utilize a reduced BI in LGM PRACH procedure of maximum approximately 128 ms. After a preselected or scheduled passage of time e.g. the reduced BI endpoint may re transmit message to base station . Following receipt of a positive RAR from base station endpoint may proceed with message . Message may also be called Message . Message may include a Scheduled Transmission Message. Further message may include L L and L3 signaling. Message may also include endpoint identification e.g. C RNTI. The C RNTI may allow base station to uniquely recognize endpoint and may indicate within message that endpoint may be a LGM device. In some embodiments message may include a LGM status

While RA procedure shown in may include four steps ending with resolution LGM PRACH procedure may not complete all four steps due to the expected short duration of the LG interval average of 200 ms. In one embodiment endpoint may not complete contention resolution with resolution . In heavy contention cases endpoint may not be identified by base station because endpoint may not be able to transmit message .

Accordingly in some embodiments due to limited time constraints a successful transmission of message may not occur. If message may not be transmitted and a high collision rate was detected on Preamble Group B possibly as a result of the collision measurements executed on message the network may conclude that a power outage or other mass scale event has occurred and at least some of endpoints may no longer be connected to the wireless network e.g. network of without being able to identify any of the LGM devices. In the illustrated embodiment the transmission may have been received but not properly detected by base station . The information such as measured preamble Group B collision rate may be transmitted to a server such as server of and or other suitable device for subsequent processing and or transmission information may be processed locally at base station .

Similar to LGM PRACH procedure shown in in order to increase the chances one or more endpoints may be detected and or identified the allocation of signatures to the PRACH Group B may be dynamically adjusted. Thus dynamic adjustment of PRACH Group B signatures may allow base station to detect and or identify as many possible endpoints transmitting a LGM. As noted above the BI e.g. the predefined time delay before endpoint sends an additional PRACH transmission if the first transmission is not successful may be reduced to maximum approximately 128 ms. The reduced BI may allow maximum two PRACH Group B preamble transmissions from endpoint to base station given the LGM duration. Multiple PRACH Group B preamble transmissions based on multiple transmissions from multiple endpoints may cause signal collisions at base station when received at base station if the same preamble Group B signatures are selected. Signal collisions may occur if a signal is transmitted from multiple endpoints and received at base station but cannot be properly decoded. If base station computes that PRACH Group B collision rate defined as P Group B is above a predefined allowable collision rate defined as base station may conclude that a power outage or other mass scale event has occurred. As a result base station may attempt to increase PRACH preamble Group B as quickly as possible to the allowed maximum size and or within the maximum allowed time. In some embodiments the time allowed for PRACH Group B expansion defined as T may be a function of the LGM duration. For example T

Further in some embodiments a timer T may be inserted following PRACH Group B size being increased to the maximum. T may be employed before base station may reduce Preamble Group B back to normal size and or after the collision rate of Preamble Group B is below the predefined allowable collision rate. The duration of T may be established according to demands of a specific implementation and or may be determined experimentally. In one embodiment utilizing a timer may avoid multiple instances of high variations of the measured collision rates due to possible inaccuracies in reading the collision rate of Group B signals.

 i Base station detects that the rate of PRACH Group B collisions is below a predefined allowable rate of collisions P Group B 

The rate of PRACH Group B collisions may be determined by the ratio of the number of PRACH Group B collisions and the PRACH Group B capacity 

LGM PRACH procedure may begin with transmission that may include a Regular Random Access Preamble L signal communicated from endpoint to base station during or immediately after a power loss or other mass scale event experienced by endpoint . Base station may respond to endpoint with response that may include an RAR. Response may include L L signaling. Endpoint may utilize a reduced BI in LGM PRACH procedure of maximum approximately 128 ms following the reception of a negative RAR. Following a positive RAR endpoint may send message also called Message . Message may include a Scheduled Transmission Message. Message may include L1 L2 L signaling. In some embodiments message may include a LGM status signal. The LGM status signal may indicate that message is from a LGM device.

While RA procedure shown in may include four steps ending with resolution LGM PRACH procedure may not complete all four steps due to the expected short duration of the LG interval average of 200 ms. In one embodiment endpoint may not complete contention resolution step with resolution . In heavy contention cases endpoint may not be identified by base station following a successful reception of message by base station . Further base station may not be able to identify all endpoints attempting to transmit message and it may be sufficient to decode oat least one message in order to trigger LGM Device Identification stages.

In some embodiments LGM PRACH procedure may allow base station to detect a LGM sent by endpoint utilizing an enhanced message . Message may correspond to endpoint that selected a Group A signature. In order to increase the chances that one or more endpoints may be detected and or identified the allocation of the PRACH Group A signatures may be dynamically adjusted. Dynamic adjustment of PRACH Group A signatures may allow base station to detect and or identify as many possible endpoints utilizing message . Further PRACH Group A maximum subframe allocation may be established according to demands of a specific implementation and or may be determined experimentally. In some embodiments PRACH Group A maximum size increase may be determined by a base station scheduler policy. As noted above the BI e.g. the predefined time delay before endpoint sends an additional PRACH L transmission may be reduced to maximum approximately 128 ms to allow one endpoint to access PRACH multiple times within the LGM duration. Notably in some embodiments LGM PRACH procedure that identifies a modification of message may not require any changes to L and or L messages.

 i Base station detects that the rate of PRACH Group A collisions is below a predefined allowable rate of collisions P Group A 

The rate of PRACH Group A collisions may be determined by the ratio of the number of PRACH Group A collisions and the PRACH Group A capacity 

Method may start and at step base station may receive signals for connection of endpoints . Endpoints may subsequently enter idle status or sleep status. At step a base station may receive Group X L signals over a PRACH from endpoints. Group X may be Group A B or C depending on the implementation selected. For example base station may receive signals from endpoints . As discussed previously a PRACH may be a shared channel used for initial communication between endpoint and base station for communication between multiple endpoints and for communication of unscheduled messages such as when endpoint goes into idle status or loses power. Thus endpoints may send LGMs to base station by utilizing the PRACH. Further Group X in step and throughout method may represent any group of preambles and or signatures for example Group C of Group B of or Group A of .

At step base station may determine if the rate of PRACH Group X collisions defined as P Group X exceeds a predefined allowable rate of collisions defined as . Thus base station may determine P Group X . As discussed with respect to base station may determine if PRACH Group C collision rate is above a predefined threshold of allowable rate of collisions.

If the rate of PRACH Group X collisions exceeds the predefined allowable rate of collisions then multiple LGMs may be transmitting and a power outage or other mass scale event may be indicated and method may proceed to step . If the rate of PRACH Group X collisions does not exceed the predefined allowable rate of collisions then a power outage or other mass scale event may not have occurred and method may return to step .

At step base station may increase the PRACH Group X allocation by a predetermined factor such as a factor of 4. If a power outage or other mass scale event has occurred and multiple LGMs are being transmitted to base station then rapidly increasing the PRACH Group X size may provide more opportunities for endpoints affected by a power outage or mass scale event to be successfully detected following a L1 PRACH transmission. For example with respect to the signatures allocated to Group C preambles may be increased.

At step base station may again determine if the rate of PRACH Group X collisions defined as P Group X exceeds a predefined allowable rate of collisions defined as . Thus base station may again determine P Group X . If the rate of PRACH Group X collisions still exceeds the predefined allowable rate of collisions then multiple LGMs may be transmitting a power outage or other mass scale event may still be indicated and method may proceed to step . If the rate of PRACH Group X collisions does not exceed the predefined allowable rate of collisions then method may return to step .

At step base station may determine if the elapsed time for PRACH Group X expansion has exceed 0.75 times or other implementation dependent duration the LGM Duration T

At step base station may determine if the PRACH Group X is at the maximum size. The maximum size for a PRACH may be preset and may be established according to demands of a specific implementation. If PRACH Group X is at the maximum allowed size then method may proceed to step . If PRACH Group X is not yet at the maximum allowed size then method may return to step .

At step base station may execute a delay. Such execution may include determining whether a previously user defined or default timer T has expired. T may be set in order to avoid possible inaccuracies and or variations on measuring the collision rate. In one embodiment T may be started when PRACH size is first increased step .

At step base station may again determine if the rate of PRACH Group X collisions defined as P Group X exceeds a predefined allowable rate of collisions defined as . Thus base station may again determine P Group X . If the rate of PRACH Group X collisions still exceeds the predefined allowable rate of collisions then multiple LGMs may be transmitting over Preamble Group X a power outage or other mass scale event may still be indicated and method may return to step . If the rate of PRACH Group X collisions does not exceed the predefined allowable rate of collisions CH then method may return to step .

At step base station may revert the PRACH back to the original size such as the size before the mass event occurred. At step base station may identify endpoints that may have transmitted an LGM. At step base station may begin to receive signals from endpoints that may have previously transmitted an LGM. These signals may be transmitted after power is restored to endpoints and may require a scheduling method based upon how many endpoints attempt to access network at a particular time. Method may then return to step .

In one embodiment base station may include modules for zone mapping LGM detection zone identification device identification multiplexer and optimized access . Such modules may be implemented in any suitable manner such as in software hardware instructions functions applications shared libraries code sections data structures or any combination thereof.

In another embodiment zone mapping LGM detection zone identification device identification multiplexer and optimized access may represent elements of a method for performing last gasp device identification. Such a method may be performed by various computer programs models or any combination thereof configured to simulate and design systems for last gasp detection. The programs and models may include instructions stored on computer readable medium and operable to perform when executed one or more of the steps described below. The computer readable media may include any system apparatus or device configured to store and retrieve programs or instructions such as a hard disk drive a compact disc flash memory or any other suitable device. The programs and models may be configured to direct a processor or other suitable unit to retrieve and execute the instructions from the computer readable media. For illustrative purposes zone mapping LGM detection zone identification device identification multiplexer and optimized access may be described with respect to network of however these may be used for last gasp identification in any suitable network.

Zone mapping may be configured to enumerate endpoints such as endpoints in communication with base station and to assign endpoints to a zone in which such endpoints are located. Zone mapping may use an algorithm such as a time advancing TA Zone Mapping algorithm. The zone to which an endpoint is assigned may include an ideal zone representation of the coverage area of base station . In one embodiment endpoints may be resident within a defined TA zone. In another embodiment endpoints may be relatively statically located providing consistency of information with regards to the TA zone associated with a given endpoint . Zone mapping may assign all endpoints connected to base station to specific zones positioned inside the geographical coverage of base station . Zone mapping may use any suitable method or mechanism of identifying endpoints as they are connected to system and of identifying the associated TA zone. For example zone mapping may record the status update of an endpoint as it migrates to an RRC IDLE status or an RRC CONNECTED status. Zone mapping may record the status in any suitable manner such as in a database file or other data structure. Furthermore zone mapping may determine the strength of the endpoint signal or triangulate the endpoint signal to determine the associated TA zone. Zone mapping may be repeated as necessary until a mass event is detected with LGM detection .

LGM detection may be configured to determine that one or more LGMs have been received from endpoints . In one embodiment LGM detection may be configured to determine whether a mass event such as a power failure has occurred based on received LGMs. LGM detection may provide a flag or other indication that a mass event has occurred. LGM detection may be implemented in any suitable method or mechanism such as by comparing LGMs received or determining that a threshold rate or number of collisions have been detected as illustrated in . In addition LGM detection may determine how long the mass event has lasted. For example LGM detection may be configured to determine the duration of a power outage affecting endpoints . In one embodiment LGM detection may be configured to continuously update such a duration. In another embodiment LGM detection may be configured to report such a duration upon conclusion of the mass event. In yet another embodiment LGM detection may provide a flag or other indicator that the mass event has concluded. LGM detection may be configured to continuously monitor for arriving LGMs.

LGM detection may be configured to output information in any suitable manner. In one embodiment LGM detection may be configured to provide notification of a mass event upon conclusion of receiving multiple LGMs. In another embodiment after LGM detection has detected a mass event and additional LGMs arrive LGM detection may be configured to notify other modules to reevaluate analysis conducted thus far. LGM detection may be configured to store information regarding endpoints in any suitable manner such as in a file database or data structure that may be shared with other modules.

In one embodiment LGM detection may be configured to perform mass event duration control and monitoring. For example given a mass event such as a power outage LGM detection may be configured to determine whether the power outage is ongoing or how long the power outage lasted. LGM detection may be configured to provide such information to for example multiplexer . Such a determination may be represented by T LGM .

Zone identification may be configured to estimate which zones such as TA zones associated with endpoints are affected by the mass event. In one embodiment zone identification may be based upon received LGMs from endpoints . However LGMs may be issued by endpoints from a given zone but may not be received by base station . Thus in another embodiment zone identification may be initialized by received LGMs and then subsequently applied to the identification of the endpoints located in the entire coverage area for base station . If some zones contained no endpoints as identified in zone mapping then zone identification may be skipped for such zones. Upon completion of zone identification an identification of zones by the mass event may be available. Zone identification may be completed in a shorter amount of time than individually polling or sampling every endpoint identified in zone mapping to determine whether such endpoint is connected or whether it has turned off in response to the mass event.

Zone identification may be configured to perform in any suitable manner such as in the steps illustrated in and in conjunction with . In one embodiment zone identification may be configured to sample known endpoints within a given zone. Such sample endpoints may be indicated by for example message of . The known endpoints within a given zone from which zone identification may sample may have been determined by zone mapping . Such sampling may include polling a given endpoint to determine whether it has turned off when it was expected to be on from zone mapping . In a further embodiment zone identification may sample subsections of a given zone. In yet another further embodiment zone identification may apply sampling weights to the sampling of zones or zone subsections. The weight may be based on for example relative size of the zone or zone subsection or upon received LGMs from a given zone or subzone.

Zone identification may be configured to output information related to zone sampling in any suitable manner. Zone identification may output a listing of zones or zone subsections associated with base station that include endpoints that are non responsive. Furthermore zone identification may output a list of zones or zone subsections from which LGMs were received. Zone identification may be configured to store the results of its analysis in any suitable manner for use by other entities such as in a database file or other data structure.

Device identification may be configured to individually poll or contact endpoints identified in enumeration as connected to system . Device identification may be performed in any suitable manner and at any suitable time. In one embodiment device identification may be performed upon completion of zone identification . In another embodiment device identification may be performed in parallel with zone identification dependent upon the available resources of base station . Device identification may require significantly longer operation than zone identification . Device identification may require a longer time to fully page or poll all endpoints than the time of a mass event itself. By polling each endpoint device identification may be more accurate in identifying endpoints associated with the mass event than zone identification .

Device identification may be configured to time its operation. In one embodiment device identification may be configured to keep a running total of the time used in execution. In another embodiment device identification may be configured to estimate the total time necessary to execute the polling of all endpoints based on the number of endpoints known through enumeration. If a mass event such as a power outage has terminated before completion of device identification then device identification may be configured to stop operation and output the analysis results to optimized access .

Device identification may be configured to output its results in any suitable manner such as with a database file record or data structure. Device identification may indicate which of endpoints are connected and which of endpoints are non responsive. In one embodiment device identification may be configured to output partial results of polling endpoints upon termination of the mass event. In another embodiment device identification may be configured to only output full results of polling endpoints . Device identification may be configured to poll endpoints in an order priority or selective basis based upon the results of zone identification . For example device identification may prioritize polling of endpoints in zones identified as experiencing the mass event.

In one embodiment device identification may be performed wholly or in part by base station . In another embodiment device identification may be performed wholly or in part by server .

Multiplexer may be configured to select from results of zone identification and device identification to output to waiting entities such as optimized access or server which may use the information to take corrective action in response to the mass event. Multiplexer may make such a selection using any suitable criteria. Multiplexer may take into account the time spent or to be spent on each of zone identification and device identification as well as the length of the mass event triggering LGM detection . Multiplexer may receive information concerning the status of a mass event such as a power outage from a suitable entity such as LGM detection that a mass event has terminated. Such an indication may be denoted as for example T LGM . Time required or elapsed for operation of device identification may be indicated as for example T LGM DEVICE ID . Time required or elapsed for operation of zone identification may be indicated as for example T LGM ZONE ID .

In one embodiment multiplexer may determine whether device identification has completed or will be completed by the time the mass event is complete. If device identification has not completed then multiplexer may select the output of zone identification to pass to entities such as optimized access . If device identification has completed then multiplexer may select the output of device identification to pass to entities such as optimized access . In another embodiment if the mass event is not over multiplexer may output interim results from device identification or zone identification . In yet another embodiment if neither device identification nor zone identification has been completed multiplexer may output a null signal. In an additional embodiment if the mass event has not terminated multiplexer may output a null signal.

For example in table given the condition that the time for completion of device identification is longer than the time of the mass event multiplexer may output the zone list from zone identification . Given the condition that the time for completion of device identification is longer than the time of the mass event and that the time of the mass event is longer than the time for completion of zone identification multiplexer may output the set of results such as a device list produced by TA device identification algorithm device identification . In any other case such as wherein the time of the mass event is not known because it has not terminated or wherein device identification has not completed multiplexer may output a null signal indicating that results are not yet ready.

In another example in table given the condition that the time for completion of device identification is shorter than the time of the mass event multiplexer may output the partial set of results listed in the device list from device identification . The output of partial results may be implementation dependent. Such a determination may be made if for example device identification has completed but the mass event has not. If such a condition is not met then given the condition that the time for completion of zone identification is shorter than the time of the mass event multiplexer may output the zone list from zone identification . Such a determination may be made if for example zone identification has completed but the mass event has not. In any other case such as wherein zone identification has not completed multiplexer may output a null signal indicating that no results are ready. Table may indicate that output may change over time from null to a zone list to a device list depending upon what is available. The recipient of such information such as optimized access may require notification from multiplexer that a given output is possibly an interim or final output.

In yet another example in table given the condition that the time for completion of device identification is shorter than the time of the mass event multiplexer may output the partial set of results provided by device list from device identification . Such a determination may be made if for example device identification has completed but the mass event has not. If such a condition is not met then given the condition that the time for completion of zone identification is shorter than the time of the mass event multiplexer may output the zone list from zone identification and whatever partial results from device identification are available. Such a determination may be made if for example zone identification has completed but the mass event has not. In any other case such as wherein zone identification has not completed multiplexer may output a null signal indicating that no results are ready. Table may indicate that output may change over time from null to a zone list to a zone list with a partial device list and to a device list depending upon what is available. The recipient of such information such as optimized access may require notification from multiplexer that a partial or final set of results is available.

Returning to optimized access may be configured to take any suitable remedial steps. Such steps may include remedial steps to be taken by base station or server to correct problems created by the mass event or to efficiently reconnect endpoints to system . Optimized access which may present an orderly PRACH procedure with reduced or no collisions may be performed wholly or in part by for example base station or server .

In operation zone mapping may identify endpoints as they are connected to system . Zone mapping may identify a location such as a TA zone associated with each endpoint and store the information. Zone mapping may repeat such actions until LGM detection determines that a mass event has occurred. In some embodiments zone mapping may repeat such actions on a continuous basis. Zone identification may use the determinations of LGM detection to inform a sampling of zones in which endpoints were residing as they were connected to system . The sampling may include polling or paging a subset of endpoints recorded as resident within a given zone. Zone identification may determine which zones have unresponsive endpoints and determine that such endpoints are associated with the mass event. Sequentially or in parallel with such operations of zone identification device identification may poll or otherwise contact each endpoint enumerated by zone mapping to determine whether the endpoint is connected to system or not.

Multiplexer may monitor whether the mass event has ended. Based on the time of the mass event the time to conduct zone identification and the time to conduct device identification multiplexer may selectively choose the output of zone identification or device identification to describe which of endpoints experienced the mass event and may have issued an LGM. Such an LGM may or may not have been received by base station . Multiplexer may provide the selected output to an entity that may take remedial action such as optimized access or server .

Method may be performed in association with a base station such as base station of . Method may be repeated or performed in parallel for each one of the co located base stations using a sectorization as illustrated in . Each such sector may correspond to a given base station.

At endpoints each designated as UE may be activated and connected to a wireless system such as system . At the status for each endpoint may be assigned as connected and at the status of each such endpoint may be assigned as idle. At it may be determined that the endpoint has successfully connected to the system and an entry for TA zone tracking may be created for the endpoint along with a determination of the TA zone in which the endpoint resides. For a given zone the endpoints determined to be connected may be grouped into a TA zone group. The TA zones may be created in one embodiment based on the TA information processed by base station for each one of the connected endpoints A real time record of the endpoints may be stored into a database file or other suitable entity. In one embodiment the endpoint may include a mobile device that moves from one zone to another. In such a case may be repeated as necessary to update the location of the endpoint. In another embodiment the endpoint may include a fixed point as part of an M2M network and thus may not require such repetition of . and may be implemented fully or in part by zone mapping of .

In a mass event may be detected. The mass event may be detected for example as a result of increased collisions in a group as shown in . Such a mass event may include reception of LGMs. may be implemented fully or in part by LGM detection of may be repeated as additional LGMs are received causing a repeat of subsequent actions of method .

In the circular subsections such as a b and c of a row k of TA zones may be sampled. Such sampling may include polling a subset of the endpoints recorded as resident within the subsection to determine whether a given endpoint is not connected. The sampling may be assigned weights such as d e and f for each subsection. The weights which may be determined empirically may be used to increase or decrease sampling based on for example radial or angular size of the subsection or previously received LGM rate from various subsections. Any disconnected endpoints from the samples may be recorded as associated with the sector TA and subsection.

In the row k may be incremented. If the row number k is still within the number of maximum TA zones m then may be repeated for the new row. Otherwise method may proceed to .

In sectors TA zones or subsections associated with disconnected endpoints and thus possibly the mass event may be reported as ZFi. Such sectors TA zones or subsections may be used to conduct remedial action if such information is reported by for example multiplexer of .

In additional sampling may be performed upon ZFi to provide additional information regarding the mass event. For each ZFi x samples may be taken. Such samples may resemble the operation of wherein x number of endpoints known to have resided with the sector TA zone or subsection may be polled to determine whether the endpoints are connected or not. The results may be used to construct a TA zone list in indicating sectors TA zones or subsections possibly affected by the mass event and further to what degree such a sector TA zone or subsection is affected. The zone list may be a modified version of the TA zone group determined in . The zone list may be stored in a database file or other suitable entity.

In order to increase the accuracy of the TA Zone ID algorithm method may be repeated until a desired LGM device identification per zone has been achieved.
