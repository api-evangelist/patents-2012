Satellite navigation systems such as a global positioning system GPS enable a receiver to determine a location from ranging signals received from a plurality of satellites. The GPS can include three major segments a space segment SS a control segment CS and a user segment US . The United States Air Force develops maintains and operates the space and control segments. GPS satellites broadcast signals from space and each GPS receiver uses these signals to calculate a three dimensional location latitude longitude and altitude of the GPS receiver and a current time at each GPS satellite. The space segment can include 24 to 32 satellites in a medium Earth orbit MEO . The control segment can include a master control station an alternate master control station and a host of dedicated and shared ground antennas and monitor stations. The user segment can include military civil commercial and scientific users.

A ground location inertial navigation geopositioning system GROUNDLINGS can be used to provide a timely backup or restoration to GPS capability and functionality in a case when the GPS system is disabled or disrupted or when insufficient GPS satellites are in view of a GPS receiver. In an example GROUNDLINGS can provide users with adequate position and or navigation information when a GPS receiver is jammed spoofed or insufficient GPS satellites are in view of the GPS receiver.

GROUNDLINGS can include a ground located transceiver GLT a GROUNDLINGS satellite GRS and a GROUNDLINGS end receiver GER . The GLT can transmit at least one uplink pseudo random noise PRN signal and at least one uplink tone signal to a GRS in an uplink transmission. In an example the GLT can sequentially transmit a first uplink PRN signal and a first tone PRN signal to a GRS on a first frequency carrier e.g. a common frequency carrier and sequentially transmit a second uplink PRN signal and a second uplink tone signal to a GRS on a second frequency carrier. The PRN signal e.g. the uplink PRN signal and a downlink PRN signal can include a time at the GLT a GLT location and ephemeris information of a plurality of GRS.

In an example the GRS can receive the uplink transmission may delay the transmission when a same frequency carrier is used for the uplink UL and downlink DL transmission e.g. time division duplexing TDD or time division multiplexing TDM then retransmit a copy of the uplink transmission e.g. the uplink PRN signal and the uplink tone signal as a downlink transmission e.g. the downlink PRN signal and the downlink tone signal . As used herein a copy of the uplink transmission can refer to a relayed copied on a same frequency carrier using TDD or a transponded copy on a different frequency carrier using frequency division duplexing FDD . The delay may be used to avoid collisions in transmitting a downlink signal and receiving an uplink signal at the GRS. In an example the uplink signal or the downlink signal may be amplified by the GRS before the downlink transmission.

The downlink signal can be received by the GLT or the GER. At the GLT the GLT can compute an ionospheric corrected Doppler shift of the downlink signal to correct for any delays to ionosphere when at least two downlink signals on different frequency carriers are used. The GLT can calculate a range using the GLT location and a time of flight TOF of the combined uplink and downlink PRN signal. The GLT can update the ephemeris information of the GRS using the corrected Doppler shift and the range. The updated ephemeris information can be encoded in subsequent uplink PRN signals.

At the GER the GER can include a GROUNDLINGS module configured to generate a GER position using a TOF of the combined uplink and downlink PRN signal and the Doppler shift of at least one of the downlink PRN signal and a downlink tone signal on a common frequency carrier. The GER can decode the downlink PRN signal. The downlink PRN signal sent from the GRS to the GER can include a copy of an uplink PRN signal from the GLT to the GRS. The GER can extract from the PRN signal the time at the GLT a GLT location or ephemeris information of the GRS. In an example the GROUNDLINGS module can generate the GER position using the TOF of the combined uplink and downlink PRN signal and the Doppler shift of the downlink tone signal. In another example the GROUNDLINGS module can include a Doppler shift module a range estimator and a receiver location estimator. The Doppler shift module can be configured to measure a Doppler shift in at least one of the downlink PRN signal and the downlink tone signal. The range estimator can be configured to calculate a GLT range from the GLT to the GRS using GRS ephemeris information and a GLT location included in the downlink PRN signal. The range estimator can also be configured to calculate a super range measurement from the timing of the combined uplink and downlink PRN signal. The super range measurement can represent a distance from the GLT to the GER via the GRS. The receiver location estimator can be configured to estimate a GER position using the ephemeris of the GRS the position of the GLT from which the portion of the super range that is the GLT to the GRS is computed the super range measurement and the measured the Doppler shift in at least one of the downlink PRN signal and the downlink tone signal. The receiver location estimator can determine an initial GER position from a GER range from the GRS to the GER and from a Doppler shift magnitude and a Doppler trend over time of at least one of the downlink PRN signal and the downlink tone signal. In an example the receiver location estimator can trend a range in a plurality of the downlink PRN signals. The receiver location estimator can also trend a Doppler shift in a plurality of the downlink PRN signals or downlink tone signals to generate the GER position. In another example the uplink and downlink can use only PRN signals. The GER can compute the Doppler shift of each PRN signal as well as decode the signal to determine TOF GRS ephemeris GLT location and any other encoded information. In another example the receiver location estimator can include an altimeter a barometer sensor or an altitude sensor for determining an altitude of the GER. The receiver location estimator can include an inertial measurement unit IMU an inertial navigation system INS a motion sensor a velocity sensor an accelerometer a magnetometer a barometer a rotation sensor a gyroscope a wheel counter an odometer or a pedometer for determining movement of the GER.

In another configuration the GROUNDLINGS module can receive a second downlink PRN signal on a second frequency carrier and correct for ionospheric errors in the GER position using the downlink PRN signal and second downlink PRN signal. In another example the GROUNDLINGS module can be configured to reset the clock bias by comparing the GLT range generated from the ephemeris of the GRS and the location of the GLT and the GLT range generated from the super range or the Doppler shift in at least one of the downlink PRN signal and the downlink tone signal.

In another configuration a method can be used for global positioning using a GER. The method can include the operation of generating a global position using a TOF of a downlink PRN signal and a Doppler shift of at least one of the downlink PRN signal and a downlink tone signal on a common frequency carrier. A computer program product can also be provided which computer program product can comprise a non transitory computer readable storage medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein the computer readable program code being adapted to be executed to implement the method discussed above.

In another example GROUNDLINGS can use other transmission stations e.g. a known transmitter KT with a standard broadcast signal to generate a global position of a GER. GROUNDLINGS can include a known transmitter KT a GROUNDLINGS satellite GRS and a GROUNDLINGS end receiver GER . In an example the KT can be owned or operated by an entity not associated with the GRS or GER. The KT can transmit a broadcast signal e.g. for another purpose . The GRS can receive the broadcast signal in an uplink transmission and transpond on a different frequency the same waveform as the broadcast signal in a downlink transmission to the GER. The GER can receive the original signal from the KT and a copy of the broadcast signal relayed through the GRS. The GER can include a GROUNDLINGS module configured to generate a global position using a TOF computed by correlating the broadcast signal from the KT and the transponded version and a Doppler shift of a copy of the broadcast signal relayed through the GRS. The GROUNDLINGS module can include a Doppler shift module a range estimator and a receiver location estimator. In an example the GROUNDLINGS module can also include a KT module and a GRS ephemeris module. The KT module can be configured to store a KT location and at least one modulation frequency transmitted by the KT. The GRS ephemeris module configured to store ephemeris information from at least one GRS. The KT module and the GRS ephemeris can be configured to update information from a GRS signal or a ground station signal. The GRS signal can be transmitted by the GRS and can include a KT location a modulation frequency transmitted by the KT or GRS ephemeris information. The ground station signal can be transmitted by a ground station e.g. the GLT or other transmission station and can include a KT location a modulation frequency transmitted by the KT or GRS ephemeris information.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The global positioning system GPS is a space based global navigation satellite system GNSS that can provide location and time information in various types of weather anywhere on or near the Earth where a GPS receiver has an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The GPS ranging signals can be broadcasted on frequencies such as the L signal 1.57542 gigahertz GHz and or L signal 1.2276 GHz . Position can be determined from matching codes in the transmitted signal and the receiver to determine the difference in time between transmission and reception. A code division multiple access CDMA code is transmitted by the GPS satellites to the receiver and correlated with replica codes to determine ranges to different satellites which can be used to determine the position of a GPS receiver on or near the Earth. Generally a GPS receiver receives signals from multiple GPS satellites e.g. four to find its position.

When a GPS satellite is blocked from the GPS receiver so too few GPS satellites are in view of the GPS receiver the GPS receiver can provide no positioning information or it can generate inaccurate or incorrect positioning information. Alternatively the GPS signal on known GPS frequencies may be jammed by an external jamming source or other electronic equipment preventing the GPS receiver from receiving a valid GPS signal. Alternatively an external spoofing source may generate a false GPS signal on known GPS frequencies in an attempt to spoof the GPS receiver to generate inaccurate or incorrect positioning information.

A ground location inertial navigation geopositioning system GROUNDLINGS can be used to provide a timely backup or restoration to GPS capability and functionality in a case when the GPS system is lost disabled disrupted or when insufficient GPS satellites are in view of a GPS receiver. In an example GROUNDLINGS can provide users with adequate position and or navigation information when a GPS receiver is jammed spoofed or insufficient GPS satellites are in view of the GPS receiver. GROUNDLINGS can be independent of the GPS three dimensional 3 D positioning. In another example the GROUNDLINGS can augment GPS e.g. in urban environment where obtaining a line of sight LOS to at least 4 GPS satellites can be difficult from time to time.

The downlink signal A E and can be a repeated signal a transponded signal or an augmented signal. A repeated signal can be a copy of the original signal repeated from the different location. A transponded signal can be frequency shifted copy of an original signal transponded from a different location. An augmented signal can be a repeated signal or a transponded signal with additional information added by a relay e.g. GRS . In an example the first uplink signal can be repeated in a first downlink signal on a same common frequency carrier or carrier frequency . In another example the first uplink signal transmitted on a first uplink frequency carrier can be transponded in a first downlink signal on a first downlink frequency carrier different from the first uplink frequency carrier and the second uplink signal transmitted on a second uplink frequency carrier can be transponded in a second downlink signal on a second downlink frequency carrier different from the second uplink frequency carrier. The first uplink frequency carrier the first downlink frequency carrier the second uplink frequency carrier and the second downlink frequency carrier can use a different frequency carrier from each other. In another example the uplink signal can include PRN signal generated by the GLT and the downlink signal can be augmented with a tone signal generated by the GRS so the downlink signal includes both the PRN signal and the tone signal. The tone signal can be a sinusoidal wave or other periodic wave form.

When a repeated signal is used in the downlink transmission a delay may be applied at the GRS to separate the downlink transmissions from the uplink transmissions to allow for time division duplexing TDD . TDD is an application of time division multiplexing TDM to separate transmission signals and received signals on a same carrier frequency. In TDD the transmission signals and the received signals e.g. the transmitted signals and the transponded signals may be carried on the same frequency carrier or carrier frequency where the transmission signals use a different time interval from the received signals so the transmission signals and the received signals do not generate interference for each other. TDM is a type of digital multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals such as transmission signals and received signals are transferred sequentially as sub channels in one communication channel and physically taking turns on the channel. When a transponded signal is used in the downlink transmission the GRS may use a frequency shifter to shift the downlink transmission to a different frequency carrier from the uplink transmission using frequency division duplexing FDD . In FDD a transmitter and a receiver can operate using different frequency carriers or carrier frequencies . In FDD interference can be avoided because the transmission signals use a different carrier frequency from the received signals.

As illustrated in GROUNDLINGS can include a constellation of low Earth orbit LEO satellites or a plurality of GRS A H to provide downlink signals that the GER can use to determine a three dimensional 3 D position of the GER. LEO can generally be defined as an orbit within the locus extending from the Earth s surface up to an altitude of approximately 2 000 kilometers km . The GRS can comprise a LEO satellite. For illustration a GPS can operate with a constellation of 24 GPS satellites. The GPS satellites can be medium Earth orbit MEO satellites. MEO also known as an intermediate circular orbit ICO can be a region of space around the Earth above the LEO altitude of approximately 2 000 km or 1 243 miles mi and below geostationary orbit altitude of 35 786 km or 22 236 mi . The geostationary orbit also known as the geostationary Earth orbit GEO can have a period equal to the Earth s rotational period and an orbital eccentricity of approximately zero. An object in the GEO can appear motionless at a fixed position in the sky relative to ground observers. In an example the GRS may be in an orbit between a GPS satellite and a surface of the Earth.

The number of GRS A H in the GRS constellation may be greater than the number of GPS satellites in the GPS constellation to provide global coverage or near global coverage. For example 66 GRS in the GRS constellation can provide global coverage from 800 km. Fewer GRS can be used for non polar coverage or if gaps can be tolerated. Each GRS can operate independently of other GRS.

In an example the GROUNDLINGS can include a ground network of interconnected GLT A C. The GLT can transmit information between each other such as updated ephemeris information of a plurality of GRS A H in GROUNDLINGS so each GLT can have updated information of the GLT in the system. In an example the interconnected GLT can operate using a master clock. In another example each GLT can be independent and can update the ephemeris information of the GRS when the GRS passes by the GLT. When the GRS are in an orbit approximately 500 km from the Earth s surface the GLT can be spaced approximately 1000 km apart to provide continuous coverage. In an example each GLT C can communicate D E and D E simultaneously with a plurality GRS C D. In another example each GRS H can communicate B C and B C simultaneously with a plurality GLT A B. In another example not shown the GER can receive and process downlink signals simultaneously from a plurality of GRS. Using the GRS in LEO instead of a GRS in MEO can reduce the power consumed to transmit the downlink signals by placing the GRS closer to the GER and generating a stronger downlink signal reception at the GER. The GRS can have a much lower cost simpler design and fewer components than a GPS. For example a GRS may be configured so as to not include an atomic clock.

Given the close range of the GRS in LEO to the GDER the signal strength for the downlink signals can be less than 10 watts W in an example. In an example the transmission of the downlink signal can be transmitted as a quasi continuous wave quasi CW . In another example the transmission of the downlink signal can be transmitted intermittently at regular intervals to save power at the GRS. In another example the GRS can be a satellite with a stable orbit within the LEO or MEO.

Although not to be limiting in any way in some exemplary embodiments the GRS A H in the GROUNDLINGS can be a CUBESAT or other similar type of small or inexpensive type satellite such as a picosatellite or a nanosatellite. The CUBESAT can be a type of miniaturized satellite that can have a volume of approximately a liter 10 centimeter cm cube with a weight less than 2 kilograms kg . The CUBESAT can use commercial off the shelf electronics components. The picosatellite or picosat can refer to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between 0.1 and 1 kg 0.22 and 2.2 lb . The nanosatellite or nanosat can refer to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between 1 and 10 kilograms kg 2.2 and 22 pounds lb . A microsatellite or microsat can refer to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between 10 and 100 kg 22 and 220 lb . These satellites e.g. the GRS can include various components capable of providing various functions such a power source or a power generation mechanism a mechanism to control heating and cooling of the satellite and or a mechanism to point a transmitter or antenna to the Earth. The power generation mechanism can include solar cells or panels. The power source can include a battery or capacitive device. The mechanism to control the heating and cooling of the satellite may control the heating and cooling of the satellite passively so the mechanism does not require a power source to function properly. The mechanism to point the transmitter or antenna to the Earth may steer or rotate the position of the satellite passively. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these several descriptions are merely exemplary and are not intended to be limiting in any way.

The GER can measure a trend in a Doppler shift of the downlink link signal e.g. the downlink tone signal and measure a TOF from the GLT to the GER via the GRS e.g. a GLT to GRS to GER range or a super range . The Doppler shift trend of the downlink signal and super range can be combined with a decoded GLT location and GRS ephemeris information within a downlink PRN signal from which the GER can compute a trend of range values from the GRS to the GER to locate the GER in a 3 D position. The GER or the GLT can be located on or near the surface of the Earth. The GER can measure the time difference between the generation of the uplink PRN signal by a GLT and the reception of the downlink PRN signal to generate a super range measurement representing the distance from the GLT to the GER via the GRS e.g. a GPS to GRS to GER range . A super range measurement can include two legs of a bent pipe that can include a GLT to GRS range represented by a time of flight TOF of the uplink PRN signal and a GRS to GER range represented by the TOF of the downlink PRN signal . The uplink PRN signal and the downlink PRN signal can encode the position or location of the GLT and or the ephemeris information of the GRS. The GER can receive the downlink PRN signal and determine the time elapsed between the signal origin and the receiver s time. The GLT to GRS range can be determined by the difference between the known location of the GLT and the known position of the GRS which can be determined from the GRS ephemeris information. The GRS to GER range can be determined by subtracting the GLT to GRS range from the super range measurement allowing for the delay in the signal at the GRS which can be known by the GER.

The ephemeris or ephemeris information can include a table various information such as the positions or orbits of a heavenly body e.g. a satellite on a number of dates and times in a regular sequence. Satellites e.g. the GRS can be described by their motions in three dimensions e.g their orbital elements ephemerides or ephemeris information . The ephemeris can include a set of elements e.g. six or fewer enscripters that can describe to a very high fidelity what the satellite s location is going to be and what the satellite s motion or orbit is going to be at any given time. An orbit can be a very specific type of circular motion that can be predicted until some outside force acts on the satellite. The ephemeris information may be updated to account for unforeseen forces on the satellite e.g. GRS such as atmospheric drag or the gravitation pull by the sun or moon.

The GER can also generate positional information of the GER location relative to the GRS by measuring a Doppler shift of the downlink signal either a downlink tone signal or a downlink PRN signal. Measuring the Doppler shift of the downlink tone signal can be more straight forward than measuring the downlink PRN signal but measuring the Doppler shift of the downlink PRN signal can be performed with additional processing. In a FDD example the downlink signal can include a Doppler shift of the GLT to GRS path on the uplink signal and a Doppler shift of the GRS to GER path on the downlink signal e.g. a double Doppler shift . Additional processing may be used in the FDD example to account for the two different frequency carriers e.g. the uplink frequency carrier and the downlink frequency carrier . Measuring a trend in Doppler shift of the downlink signal can allow the GER to determine the location of the GER with greater accuracy over time. The GRS to GER range or the Doppler shift may have some error if a timing offset between a time on a GLT clock and a GER clock occurs.

For illustration a GEO satellite can have a velocity of approximately 3 km second sec to match the velocity of the Earth with an apparent velocity of approximately 0 km sec. The apparent velocity can be an object s velocity such as a satellite e.g. GRS relative to another object such as the GLT or the GER at a fixed point on the Earth. A GRS in the LEO or other LEO satellite can have an orbit with a velocity of an approximately 7 km sec or an apparent velocity of approximately 6.5 7.5 km sec relative to the fixed point on the Earth. Measuring the speed of the GRS using the Doppler shift of an uplink signal transmitted by the GLT and downlink signal transmitted by the GRS can be used to generate global positioning of the GER.

A Doppler shift can be a change in a frequency or a change in a wavelength of a wave for an observer such as a receiver moving relative to the source of the wave such as a transmitter on a satellite. The motion of the observer the source or both can generate a change of the measured frequency. The relative changes in frequency due to the Doppler effect can be explained as follows. When the source of the waves is moving toward the observer each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave. Therefore each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Thus the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced causing an increase in the frequency. While the waves are traveling the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced so the waves bunch together . Conversely if the source of waves is moving away from the observer each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave so the arrival time between successive waves is increased reducing the frequency. The distance between successive wave fronts is increased so the waves spread out .

The Doppler shift can be proportional to the carrier frequency e.g. frequency carrier . Higher frequencies can provide more accuracy in Doppler measurements than lower frequencies but generating higher frequencies can consume more power in the satellite e.g. GRS than lower frequencies. Objects moving at greater velocities relative to each other can provide more accuracy in Doppler measurements than objects moving at slower velocities relative to each other. Objects at closer distances to each other can provide more accuracy in Doppler measurements than objects at farther distances to each other. The satellite operating in LEO can impose a greater amount of Doppler shift on the uplink and downlink signals than a satellite operating in MEO which can have a slower apparent velocity. The Doppler shift of a downlink signal from the GRS at a known position to an unknown point such as the GER can uniquely determine the location of the GER based on orbital parameters of the GRS.

On a reception side of the GLT the GLT can include at least one downlink receiving antenna a downlink signal receiver and a GRS ephemeris updater . The downlink signal receiver can be configured to receive the downlink signals from a GRS or other transmission station via the at least one downlink receiving antenna. In an example the uplink transmitting antenna and the downlink receiving antenna may be integrated into a single antenna unit. The GRS ephemeris updater can be used to determine and refine GRS ephemeris using the received downlink signals. When the first uplink signal and the second uplink signal are received the GRS ephemeris updater can correct a Doppler shift due to ionospheric interference and delay or refraction in the downlink signals and compute a corrected Doppler shift of the downlink signals. Using the downlink signals e.g. corrected Doppler shift of the downlink signals the GRS ephemeris updater can compute a GLT to GRS range e.g. GLT range using the TOF of the downlink PRN signals. The GLT may have no clock bias since the originating signal e.g. uplink signal and the return signal e.g. the downlink signal use a same clock. In an example the GRS ephemeris updater can update the precision of the GRS ephemeris using the corrected Doppler shift of the downlink signals and the GLT range. In another example the GRS ephemeris updater can determine an ephemeris to better than a 1 meter m and 10 centimeter second cm sec resolution.

A second set of signals e.g. the first uplink and downlink signals and the second uplink and downlink signals can be transmitted by the GLT and received by the GLT to at least partially compensate for various factors and occurrences such as atmospheric delays and refraction in the transmitted signals and in the transponded signals.

Atmospheric delays can include ionospheric delays and tropospheric delays. Ionospheric delay occurs in the ionosphere which is a part of the upper atmosphere comprising portions of the mesosphere thermosphere and exosphere distinguished because the upper atmosphere can be ionized by solar radiation. The ionosphere can play a part in atmospheric electricity and forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere and can influence radio propagation to distant places on the Earth. Tropospheric delay occurs in the troposphere which includes the lowest portion of the Earth s atmosphere.

Refraction can be the change in direction of a wave due to a change in the index of refraction of the medium through which the signal passes. Although atmospheric refraction may not be measured the second set of signals can be used to estimate for atmospheric refraction and account for the estimate in final range estimates. Atmospheric refraction can include the deviation of light or other electromagnetic wave such as a RF signal from a straight line as the light or other electromagnetic wave passes through the atmosphere. Refraction can occur due to the variation in air density as a function of altitude. Refraction can cause an extra path to be introduced into flight and can generate a small error in range measurements.

In essence atmospheric delays and refraction can vary the TOF and the Doppler shift of signals which variances can be accounted or compensated for by the second set of signals. The frequency carrier can be selected to minimize the atmospheric delays and refraction effects on the signal. For example the atmospheric delays e.g. ionospheric delays can be a function of the inverse of the frequency squared. Using the relationship between the atmospheric delays and the frequency can enable correction of ionospheric delays using two or more carriers. For frequency carriers with a frequency band between 1 2 gigahertz GHz the effects due to ionospheric delays can be very small. For frequency carriers with a frequency band greater than 2 GHz the effects due to ionospheric delays can be negligible. For frequency carriers with a frequency band less than 1 GHz the effects due to ionospheric delays can be more significant. The ultra high frequency UHF band is the radio frequency range from 300 megahertz MHz to 3 GHz. A frequency carrier with a frequency band greater than the UHF band can minimize the effects of the ionospheric delays so a single set of uplink and downlink signals may be used with high resolution.

The frequency carrier of the uplink and downlink signals can be selected to minimize and avoid jammed portions of the radio spectrum reduce ionosphere interference or delays improve the Doppler shift resolution or reduce the power drain on the GRS due to transmitting the downlink signals. The uplink signals and the downlink signal can operate in a frequency band e.g. a GRS frequency band between a very high frequency VHF band to a K under K band. The VHF band is the radio frequency range from 30 megahertz MHz to 300 MHz and the Kband is the radio frequency range from 10.95 gigahertz GHz to 14.5 GHz or the band directly below the K band. The K band is the radio frequency range from 18 GHz to 27 GHz. The GRS frequency band can include the VHF an ultra high frequency UHF and portions of a super high frequency SHF band such as the Kband.

In another example when the GRS ephemeris information is not initially known e.g. stored on the GLT the ephemeris or orbit of the GRS can be determined using various methods for determining the orbit of a satellite e.g. GRS . In an example the ephemeris information of the GRS can be obtained using the methods and systems described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 463 522 filed May 3 2012 May 2 2012 entitled Position and Elevation Acquisition for Orbit Determination which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

Referring back to a GROUNDLINGS satellite GRS can receive the uplink signals from the GLT . In an example the GRS can include at least one uplink receiving antenna an uplink signal receiver for receiving the uplink signals a frequency shifter or delay module for generating the downlink signals from the uplink signals at least one downlink transmitting antenna and or a downlink signal transmitter for transmitting the downlink signals on selected frequency carriers to the GER . In an example the downlink transmitting antenna and the uplink receiving antenna may be integrated into a single antenna unit. The downlink transmitting antenna or the uplink receiving antenna can be a wide angle antenna to cover the Earth from a low orbit. An amplifier may be use to increase or boost the power of the downlink signals. In an example the frequency shifter or delay module can provide a delay so both uplink transmissions and downlink transmissions can operate on a same frequency carrier without signal collisions when TDD is used. In another example the frequency shifter or delay module can provide a frequency shifter to shift an uplink signal from the uplink frequency carrier to a different downlink frequency carrier when FDD is used. In another example the GRS can include an ephemeris updater which can extract the GRS ephemeris information and or the GLT location or other transmission station locations from the uplink signal and store the information in a storage medium e.g. a database . In another configuration the GRS can augment the downlink signal with the GRS ephemeris information or the GLT location which can be used to generate a range or super range. In another configuration not shown the GRS can include a tone generator to generate a downlink tone signal from the GRS which can be used to measure a Doppler shift.

The GROUNDLINGS end receiver GER can include at least one downlink receiver antenna a downlink signal receiver a signal despreader and a GROUNDLINGS module . The GER can determine a GER location based on a timing or TOF of the downlink PRN signal and a Doppler shift in the downlink signal e.g. a downlink tone signal or a downlink PRN signal which can be processed by one of the modules of the GER. The GROUNDLINGS module can generate a global 3 D position of the GER using the GLT location the GRS ephemeris a TOF super range measurement and a Doppler shift in downlink signals. The downlink signal receiver can detect the analog radio frequency RF downlink signals received. The signal despreader can demodulate despread and or decode the downlink signals. The signal despreader can extract the time at a GLT and or a GRS location based on GRS ephemeris from the downlink signal. In an example the signal despreader can be used to determine the TOF e.g. super range measurement of the combined uplink and downlink signal with known processing delays at the GRS .

The GROUNDLINGS module can include a Doppler shift module a range estimator and a receiver location estimator . In an example the range estimator can compute a super range from a timing or TOF of the PRN signal and estimate a range to the GRS using the GLT location and the GRS ephemeris. From the super range and the estimated GLT to GRS range the GRS to GER range can be estimated. The Doppler shift can generate a corrected shift of the downlink signal when at least two sets of downlink signals are used. The Doppler shift e.g. corrected shift of the downlink signal can be used obtain an initial bearing to the GER. The receiver location estimator can determine an initial position of the GER from a Doppler shift magnitude a Doppler slope e.g. or integrated Doppler measurement the GRS to GER range and the GRS position. The Doppler shift magnitude can provide a bearing of the GRS relative to the GER. In an example the receiver location estimator can iterate e.g. repeat measurements and estimation the 3 D position of the GER using a GER linear model the ranges the Doppler shift and Doppler measurements trended over time to generate additional precision in the GER location. In an example the position and velocity of a GER can be displayed on an output device not shown such a display or screen. A comparison of the ranges derived from the super range and the Doppler shift of the downlink signals can be used to reset GER clock bias.

In an example with a nearly stationary GER or a GER with a known velocity the GER can compute a range and a bearing within 20 meters within one second. Initially a range error can be dominated by clock bias which can provide an initial resolution of 300 m or greater. Within 5 seconds of an initial Doppler measurement the dominant errors can include range in bearing errors and clock error in range measurements. Multiple measurements including multiple angles can reduce error due to clock bias and can be used to track GER movement or motion.

A GER using a more accurate oscillator can have less clock error. The GER clock error can be substantial e.g. 1 microsecond sec can corresponds to a 300 meter error and can adversely affect an estimated volume in which the GER is located. The estimated volume can be a long thin cylinder whose long dimension is centered on the line between the GRS and GER. As the GRS moves rapidly across the sky a series of error cylinders can be generated with a long axis of each error cylinder pointing towards the GRS. The GER can compute the intersections of the long cylinders to determine a 3 D position of the GER. Once a 3 D position of the GER is known the GER can correct clock errors and update its position very precisely in 3 D coordinates. Alternatively signals from two or more GRS may be received in parallel or sequentially to refine the position estimate and reduce and or remove the effects of clock bias. A trend in the Doppler shift of the downlink signals combined with range measurements can be used to precisely determine the location of the GER within a small circular error at a known altitude or with a stable altitude. When a prior knowledge of the GER s altitude is not known an altimeter can be used to provide an altitude of the GER. The altimeter can be used to initialize the altitude of the GER. The altimeter can be a pressure altimeter or a barometric altimeter but other types of altimeters can also be used such as a sonic altimeter or a RADAR radio detection and ranging altimeter. When altitude is not known the GER may occupy a cylindrical region of uncertainty.

In another example the receiver location estimator can include an altimeter a barometer sensor or an altitude sensor for determining an altitude of the GER. The receiver location estimator can include an inertial measurement unit IMU an inertial navigation system INS a motion sensor a velocity sensor an accelerometer a magnetometer a barometer a rotation sensor a gyroscope a wheel counter an odometer or a pedometer for determining movement of the GER.

In another example the GER can include a GPS receiver not shown to provide a dual global positioning in an end receiver using GSP and GROUNDLINGS. The GPS receiver can include a GPS signal receiver and a GPS signal processor for obtaining a global positioning of the GER using standard GPS processing. The GER position determined by GPS can be compared to the GER position determined by the GROUNDLINGS module which can be used to verify that the GPS has not been spoofed.

Another example provides a method for global positioning using a ground location inertial navigation geopositioning system GROUNDLINGS end receiver GER as shown in the flow chart in . The method includes the operation of generating a global position using a time of flight TOF of a downlink pseudo random noise PRN signal and a Doppler shift of at least one of the downlink PRN signal and a downlink tone signal on a common frequency carrier wherein the downlink PRN signal sent from a GROUNDLINGS satellite GRS to the GER comprises a copy of an uplink PRN signal from a ground located transceiver GLT to the GRS and the downlink tone signal is received from the GRS as in block .

The operation of generating a GER position can include extracting GRS ephemeris information and a GLT location from the downlink PRN signal determining a GLT range from the GLT to the GRS using the ephemeris of the GRS and the location of the GLT calculating a super range measurement from a timing of the downlink PRN signal wherein the super range measurement represents a distance from the GLT to the GER via the GRS measuring a Doppler shift of at least one of the downlink PRN signal and a downlink tone signal and estimating a GER position using the ephemeris of the GRS the GLT range the super range measurement and the measured the Doppler shift in at least one of the downlink PRN signal and the downlink tone signal.

The GER can include modules and functionality similar to the modules and functionality described with including a GROUNDLINGS module . The signal despreader can be used to extract information on the GRS ephemeris from the downlink signal. The GER can include a GROUNDLINGS module configured to generate a global position using a TOF of a broadcast signal from the KT and a TOF and a Doppler shift of a copy of the broadcast signal relayed through the GRS. The GROUNDLINGS module can include a Doppler shift module a range estimator and a receiver location estimator . In an example the GROUNDLINGS module can also include a KT module and or a GRS ephemeris module . The KT module can be configured to store a KT location and or at least one modulation frequency transmitted by the KT. The GRS ephemeris module configured to store ephemeris information from at least one GRS or the GRS ephemeris module can store an almanac of GRS ephemerides in GROUNDLINGS in a searchable storage medium e.g. database . The KT module and or the GRS ephemeris can be configured to periodically update or refresh information from a GRS signal a ground station signal or other space or terrestrial communication. A more frequent update of the GRS ephemeris information can improve accuracy of the GER location. In an example the downlink signal can be transmitted by the GRS and can include a KT location a modulation frequency transmitted by the KT and or GRS ephemeris information. In another example the ground station signal can be transmitted by a ground station e.g. the GLT or other transmission station and can include a KT location a modulation frequency transmitted by the KT and or GRS ephemeris information. In another example the location of the KT can be entered by a user stored in the GER or provided by some other external source such as the GRS. When the GRS ephemeris information is not transmitted by the GRS the GER can obtain the GRS ephemeris information stored in the GRS ephemeris module.

In another example when the KT location is not known the range estimator may compare the TOF measurement of the original broadcast signal with the TOF measurement of the downlink signal representing a delayed copied of the broadcast signal. The comparison can be used to determine a delay a range or a KT location. The Doppler shift and trend of the Doppler shift of the downlink signal can be used by the GROUNDLINGS module to determine the location of the GER as previously discussed in relation to GROUNDLINGS adapted to the GLT. In GROUNDLINGS the range values and Doppler shift values of the downlink signal can be unique to a GRS position thus unique to a GER location.

Another example provides a method for global positioning using a ground location inertial navigation geopositioning system GROUNDLINGS end receiver GER as shown in the flow chart in . The method includes the operation of generating a global position using a time of flight TOF of a broadcast signal from a known transmitter KT and a TOF and a Doppler shift of a copy of the broadcast signal relayed through a GROUNDLINGS satellite GRS as in block .

The GROUNDLINGS can provide timely space based positioning navigation and timing PNT backup or restoration to GPS capability in case GPS is completely or partially disabled. The GROUNDLINGS can provide PNT services in case of loss of GPS. In addition the GROUNDLINGS can provide users of GPS e.g. user with a GPS receiver and a GER or an integrated GPS and GROUNDLINGS end receiver adequate position and or navigation information when a GPS receiver is jammed spoofed or insufficient GPS satellites are in view of the end receiver. The GROUNDLINGS can also add precision to the existing GPS.

The positional accuracy of the GER can depend on a number of GRS in view a time to process a starting knowledge of the GER position a gER velocity and a GER acceleration. Once an initial GER position is established a very fast convergence can occur to update the GER position. The GER position can be initialized with various options such as user input a handover from a last GPS position signals from two or more GRS or extended time measurements with one GRS. In many cases downlink signals from a single GRS can provide enough information to locate the position of the GER.

In an embodiment the ground location inertial navigation geopositioning system GROUNDLINGS can restore and or replace GPS like capability without GPS satellites. The GROUNDLINGS can enable rapid 3 D determination of position for receivers in motion and at rest using signals from only one satellite e.g. GRS . The GROUNDLINGS can provide a low cost augmentation to the GPS service. The GROUNDLINGS can use very small LEO satellites including CUBESATs for a large constellation. The GROUNDLINGS can have significant re use of existing receiver hardware and techniques. The performance of GROUNDLINGS is scalable with size of the GRS satellites constellation. In an embodiment most processing can be offloaded from the space segment of the GROUNDLINGS to the ground segment where components can be cheaper and easier to maintain.
