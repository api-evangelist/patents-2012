title: System and method for target profiling using social network analysis
abstract: A profile or dossier of a user is constructed based partly on data culled from a data network that reveals indirect, network-mediated relationships with other individuals and groups. The profile is assembled from information, such as properties of a target individual to build an initial social circle of the target individual. References to the target individual can be derived from the direct and indirect associations in order to compile a dossier on the target individual from the references to the target individual. The initial social circle may be expanded by building respective new social circles having new associations by crawling a plurality of web sites, and deriving additional references to the target individual from the new associations in the new social circles. According to a further aspect of the method, compiling a dossier includes extracting metadata from the references.

This disclosure relates to data analysis. More particularly this disclosure relates to construction of a dossier or profile of an individual based on data obtained via a data network.

Several methods and systems for analyzing information extracted from the Internet are known in the art. Such methods and systems are used by a variety of organizations such as intelligence analysis security government and law enforcement agencies. For example Verint Systems Inc. Melville N.Y. offers several web Intelligence WEBINT solutions that collect analyze and present Internet content.

One aspect of web intelligence WEBINT focuses on converting raw web data into unique operative insights that are an integral part of the intelligence cycle. One of the main challenges is to get the data in the first place through regular harvesting of public information or more complicated processes like those described below.

According to disclosed embodiments hereof a profile or dossier of a user is constructed based partly on data culled from a data network that reveals indirect network mediated relationships with other individuals and groups.

There is provided according to embodiments of the disclosure a method of assembling information which is carried out by identifying properties of a target individual building an initial social circle of the target individual by crawling a plurality of web sites to identify direct and indirect associations thereof deriving references to the target individual from the direct and indirect associations and compiling a dossier on the target individual from the references to the target individual.

One aspect of the method includes expanding the initial social circle by building respective new social circles having new associations by crawling the plurality of web sites and deriving additional references to the target individual from the new associations in the new social circles. Expanding the initial social circle and deriving additional references may be performed recursively based on the new associations.

According to one aspect of the method deriving additional references recursively includes automatically determining a level of recursion.

According to an additional aspect of the method compiling a dossier includes weighting the references to the target individual for correlation thereof

According to a further aspect of the method compiling a dossier includes extracting metadata from the references.

According to yet another aspect of the method compiling a dossier includes correlating the references according to similarities and commonalities therebetween.

Still another aspect of the method includes extracting metadata from the references and correlating the references includes correlating the metadata.

According to an additional aspect of the method building an initial social circle includes automatically generating leads to the target individual.

An aspect of the method includes determining candidates for the target individual wherein the candidates lack accounts on the plurality of web sites.

A further aspect of the method includes applying an entity matching procedure to specify the target individual from among the candidates.

Other embodiments of the disclosure provide computer software product and apparatus for carrying out the above described method.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various principles disclosed herein. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art however that not all these details are necessarily always needed for practicing the techniques disclosed herein. In this instance well known circuits control logic and the details of computer program instructions for conventional algorithms and processes have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the general concepts unnecessarily.

Aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in software programming code which is typically maintained in permanent storage such as a computer readable medium. In a client server environment such software programming code may be stored on a client or a server. The software programming code may be embodied on any of a variety of known non transitory media for use with a data processing system such as a diskette hard drive electronic media or CD ROM. The code may be distributed on such media or may be distributed to users from the memory or storage of one computer system over a network of some type to storage devices on other computer systems for use by users of such other systems.

Turning now to the drawings reference is initially made to which is a block diagram that schematically illustrates an analytic system in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The system typically comprises a general purpose or embedded computer processor which is programmed with suitable software for carrying out the functions described hereinbelow. Thus although portions of the system shown in and other drawing figures herein are shown as comprising a number of separate functional blocks these blocks are not necessarily separate physical entities but rather may represent for example different computing tasks or data objects stored in a memory that is accessible to the processor. These tasks may be carried out in software running on a single processor or on multiple processors. The software may be provided to the processor or processors on tangible non transitory media such as CD ROM or non volatile memory. Alternatively or additionally the system may comprise a digital signal processor or hard wired logic.

The system is connected to a wide area network WAN which is typically the Internet in order to carry out web intelligence and other analytic functions. The system can be used for example by various intelligence analysis security government and law enforcement organizations.

Via network users post content on any number of web sites shown representatively as social network web site forum web site and blog web site For example users may post web pages on blogs and social network sites interact with one another using Instant Messaging IM web sites post threads on web forums respond to news articles using talkback messages or post various other kinds of data items. A group comprising any number of other users may also post items on the web sites in many combinations. In general very few details of the users are known. However by analysis of the postings by the group and direct or indirect references to various ones of the users it is possible to develop details concerning selected users and to construct profiles or dossiers thereon. When feasible interception of non open source IM traffic could provide still further details regarding the target individual.

The embodiments described herein are mainly concerned with social media such as social networks forums blogs instant messaging IM and on line comments to newspaper articles but the disclosed techniques can also be used in any other suitable types of web site. Generally the methods and systems described herein can be used with any web site that allows users to annotate the web site content e.g. comment or rate content and or to interact with one another in relation to the web site content. Web sites may implement these features using various tools such as Google Friend Connect or Facebook Connect. As another example web based e mail sites often support social network capabilities such as Yahoo Updates or Google Buzz. As yet another example on line storage services such as Windows Live Skydrive allow users to upload annotate and share files. Web sites such as Picassa and Flickr allow users to upload annotate and share image albums.

Other web sites offer niche social networks for users having special interests such as music movie reviews and ratings. On line billboards and e commerce web sites allow users to upload content and personal profiles annotate uploaded content and provide ratings and comments. Web based e mail sites allow users to upload contact lists and details. Other exemplary types of web sites are on line dating services and payment authentication services such as PayPal. Further alternatively the disclosed techniques can be used with any web site that allows users to sign in and upload data items. Some web sites e.g. the Internet Movie Databases IMDb implement social network capabilities using proprietary technology. Other web sites use third party tools such as Loopt location presence software.

Typically a user identifies himself on a given web site using some identifier. An identifier may comprise for example a username or a nickname. In some web sites users sign in using their e mail addresses in combination with a site specific password in which case the e mail address serves as the identifier. In some cases e.g. in some location based services users identify on a web site using their telephone numbers as identifiers. As another example some web sites use a third party application e.g. Facebook in order to identify users and allow access to personal information such as friend lists and profile images.

As yet another example some web sites allow users to claim vanity Uniform Resource Locators URLs . A vanity URL in combination with a username or e mail address is sometimes used for authentication. With web sites of this sort a vanity URL can be regarded as an identifier. Some web sites e.g. OpenID users may validate themselves through a third party URL as an identifier. In most web sites the user selects a user identifier when registering with the web site and the user identifier appears in the data items posted by the user on that site.

It is very common for users to employ different user identifiers on different web sites. The use of multiple identifiers may be innocent or hostile. Innocent users may use different identifiers for privacy for style or for any other reason. Hostile users such as criminals or terrorists may use different identifiers as aliases in order to evade surveillance. The system applies various criteria for detecting and identifying aliases of an individual participating in different web sites.

The system comprises a network interface for communicating with network . A web crawler crawls web sites and retrieves data items that were posted on by users . Data items may comprise for example social network or blog posts forum or IM messages talkback responses and or any other types of data items. Each retrieved data item was posted on a certain web site by a certain user and comprises an identifier that is associated with that user. Data items that were posted by the same user on different web sites however may comprise different user identifiers.

A correlation processor extracts user identifiers from retrieved data items and correlates the user identifiers from different web sites using methods that are described further below. Typically correlation processor identifies two or more user identifiers that belong to a given user and creates a unified identity which comprises the user identifiers and may comprise other information pertaining to the user.

Web crawler and correlation processor store retrieved data items extracted identifiers unified identities and or any other relevant information in a database . Database may comprise any suitable storage device such as one or more magnetic disks or solid state memory devices and may hold the information in any suitable data structure. In some embodiments correlation processor extracts from the retrieved data items personal information regarding users and stores the personal information in database as part of the users unified identities. Personal information may comprise for example e mail addresses physical addresses telephone numbers dates of birth and photographs.

Information extracted from the retrieved data items can be stored in database using various types of data structures. In an embodiment the data is stored in a hierarchical data structure which enables straightforward access and analysis of the information. For example when extracting information from a forum discussion the data structure may comprise a table listing the threads appearing in the forum. A related table may list the content and responses of users in each thread. In an embodiment the data structure enables uniform storage of information that was gathered from multiple different types of web sites e.g. forums and social networks. The data structure may comprise a centralized table of users which holds user information such as e mail addresses user identifiers and photographs gathered from multiple web sites. In an embodiment the database enables storage and retrieval of textual information as well as binary information e.g. images and attached documents . In an embodiment the data structure is implemented using Structured Query Language SQL .

The system presents the unified identities and any other relevant information to an operator typically an analyst using an operator terminal . Operator terminal comprises suitable input and output devices for presenting information to operator and for allowing the operator to manipulate the information and otherwise control system . For example the operator may access the entire body of data items posted by a given user including data items that were retrieved from multiple web sites and have multiple user identifiers. By jointly accessing all the content associated with the given user gathered from multiple social media web sites the analyst is able to track the network activity of the user in question.

In some embodiments web crawler crawls a predefined list of social media web sites that are of interest. In an example embodiment the web crawler is provided with a crawling template or data mining template for each web site or for each type of web site. The template defines the logic and criteria for retrieving data items for extracting user identifiers from data items and for identifying additional information in the data items that assists in identifier correlation.

Typically system retrieves data items extracts and correlates user identifiers in a data centric manner i.e. without focusing a priori on any specific target users. The output of such a process is a database of unified identities each comprising a set of user identifiers and other information related to a respective user. An analyst may query this database when the need arises. For example when one identifier of a certain target user is known the database can be queried in order to find other identifiers that are used by the target user and thus access additional web content posted by that user on other web sites. In alternative embodiments however system may operate in a target centric manner i.e. focus on data items and identifiers belonging to specific target users. Unification of user identifiers may be achieved using the teachings of copending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 187 438 filed Jul. 21 2011 entitled System and Method for Unification of User Identifiers in Web Harvesting which is herein incorporated by reference.

In some embodiments web crawler crawls data items that are not normally accessible to search engines such as data items that normally require human data entry for access e.g. entry of user credentials checking of a check box selection from a list or entry of a query that causes generation of the data item on demand .

The system configuration shown in is an exemplary configuration which is chosen purely for the sake of conceptual clarity. In alternative embodiments any other suitable system configuration can be used. For example the system may comprise two or more web crawlers instead of one web crawler and correlation processor may be implemented on a single computing platform. In some embodiments system may carry out additional WEBINT and or analytic functions. Typically web crawler and or correlation processor comprise general purpose computers which are programmed in software to carry out the functions described herein.

Unlike traditional open source intelligence OSINT WEBINT according to an embodiment of the disclosure exploits public limited information i.e. information that is visible via a regular browser and is not part of a private communication as in chat but is nevertheless displayed only to a limited generally predefined group of individuals e.g. on a social networking site. Additionally according to an embodiment of the disclosure WEBINT attempts to compile information relating to individuals who refrain entirely from opening social networking accounts. This presents an even greater challenge.

One aspect of social networks today is a trend in the ability of a subscriber sometimes referred to herein as a user to control what portions of his profile are displayed and to whom. This trend has resulted in high configurability of social network accounts allowing subscribers to limit almost any aspect of their public profiles including friend lists posts and even the profile image itself In addition social networks have simplified the management of friend lists in a way that has increased the scope of profile exposure even achieving a granularity of individual posts and photos. Such privacy enhancements obviously complicate the task of assembling information on a target individual. The term friend as applied to on line relationships comprehends a minimal connection such as social acquaintanceship or membership in a class or society. It does not necessarily imply a relationship of affection or trust.

One method of compiling a dossier on a target individual whether or not he has a personal presence on a particular network site relies on indirect internet appearances . These are references to the target individual by others. For example social networks may allow the target individual to be designated as a friend of a subscriber. This designation permits the subscriber to upload various information regarding the target individual including identifying his physical location mentioning his name in postings to the site and uploading pictures in which the target individual appears. Even if the target individual subscribes to the web site but has caused his profile to be blocked his friends profiles may nevertheless be visible and contain data of interest relating to the target individual.

Indeed even in cases where the target individual has no direct connection to the web site whatsoever he may nevertheless be included in a social circle that overlaps with a group of mutual friends on the web site and he may accordingly be referred to in communications among that group of friends. Additionally the target individual may be active on other web sites which may have shared links with those of the friends. So long as the privacy settings of the friends permit such information may be collected and provide useful leads regarding the target individual.

Reference is now made to which is a flow chart of a method of constructing a dossier of an individual according to an embodiment hereof The process steps are shown in a particular linear sequence in for clarity of presentation. However it will be evident that many of them can be performed in parallel asynchronously or in different orders. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that a process could alternatively be represented as a number of interrelated states or events e.g. in a state diagram. Moreover not all illustrated process steps may be required to implement the process. The method may be performed automatically using a suitably programmed computing device connected to the internet or other data network with minimal or no operator assistance.

At initial step a list of web sites is prepared e.g. web sites . The list may include any publically declared web sites belonging to or maintained by the target individual. However generally these do not exist.

Next at step a list of relevant properties of the target individual is prepared. The list may include his nickname s picture birthplace etc. It is notable that more than one nickname may be applicable to respective accounts on a given web site or to accounts on different web sites. All the nicknames are useful for aggregating lists of on line friends of the target individual and identifying any physical locations with which he may be associated. Information developed in step constitutes leads to the target individual that can be exploited when there is limited information about the target individual as explained below. It is desirable that the system interface typically a wizard simplifies lead definition and entry. The requisite technical knowledge and expertise required from the operator can thus be minimized. Typically the wizard facilitates account inputs and automatically aids the process by offering suggestions based on both raw data and operator inputs. The system is adapted cooperatively with the wizard to expose initial leads automatically and optimize expansion of the leads to encompass the target individual s on line and off line social circles.

In step the list prepared in initial step is scanned to determine if the target individual has a public presence thereon to identify on line friends of the target individual. This is a first phase of constructing a social circle of the target individual.

Next at step in a second phase the social circles of the target individual are augmented by identifying relationships outside the on line environment to identify off line associates of the target individual. The information derived from both of steps may be memorized for example in a relational database. The off line relationships may include for example organizational memberships present and historical academic associations career associations and avocational groups. Off line relationships and indirect affiliations with other individuals belonging to such groups and organizations represent fertile ground for discovering new information about the target individual. On line references to off line groups if available are aggregated including social website participation network profiles and friends list of the other individuals.

In step any references to the original target individual derived from the on line and off line associations identified in steps are compiled and correlated. In one embodiment the correlation processor assigns to each information item a weight or score suggesting the likelihood that this is a reference to the target individual. For example a friend link to a unique URL receives a high weight. In another example a tag in a picture with a name but not associated with a link would be assigned a relatively low weight. Determining a likelihood that an information item is related to the target individual may be accomplished using any of the methods taught in the above noted U.S. application Ser. No. 13 187 438 including extracting metadata from the information items and correlating the information items according to similarities and commonalities therebetween. In general a higher weight is given to entities downloaded automatically from a profile compared with entities entered by an operator.

Next the relationships discovered in step are optionally expanded by recursive investigation. It should be understood that the principles of the method are explained with reference to recursion by way of example and not of limitation. Embodiments of the method that avoid recursion may be implemented using techniques well known in the computer programming art.

The process attempts to recognize new social circles as a high priority. Once a circle is established three or more friends mutually connected the system tries to expand the circle in order to increase the amount of data that can be extracted from it. In particular there is a relatively high priority given to expanding social circles that have already provided posts pictures etc. as compared with social circles who have only resulted in friend connections. Optimization of the expansion process also accords relatively high priority to certain types of affiliation e.g. siblings compared to biologically unrelated users users who had an actual interaction with the target individual users who had interactions determined to be strong 

At decision step it is determined whether associates of the target individual remain to be evaluated or whether some other termination condition has occurred for example a predetermined level of recursion exhaustion of identified on line and off line associates or expiration of a predetermined time interval. If so the procedure ends at final step .

Otherwise an associate of the target individual is selected at step and treated as the target individual in step for purposes of iterating step . The on line presence and social circle of the individual selected in step are recursively investigated by iterating step . It will be apparent that a large cluster of individuals having possible relationships to the original target individual may be identified which improves the likelihood of discovering information related to the target individual that can be included in his dossier.

The determination of a level of recursion is established by considering the information uncovered in the first performance of step . For example if sufficiently rich information regarding the target individual is obtained then there may be no need to download friends of friends and the recursion level may be set accordingly to zero. In general the recursion level may be set by the operator. Alternatively incremental information obtained at each recursion level may be evaluated e.g. by counting references to the target individual or by another suitable metric. When the metric falls below a predefined threshold of significance recursion may be terminated. Further alternatively when recursion may be terminated when usage of computer or network resources exceeds a threshold level.

Moreover in order to optimize the method the extent of investigation in step may be automatically limited responsively to the nature of information uncovered. The following examples illustrate this issue. Many combinations based on the examples presented below are possible. In all cases the system detects the situation as it appears after the first iteration of step and reacts accordingly.

In the first iteration of step assume that only friends of the target individual on a social web site are available 

In the first iteration of step assume that only the user information sometimes referred to herein as a wall is open. As used herein the term wall refers to a feed of information that is either published by a user or by his social circle either as a post or a post that is related to him and automatically appears on his feed as well. It can consist from status feeds pictures events links and other social activity. It is the user s social activity aggregated from an entire social network including other online sites.

Get all photos of the target individual and all photos where the target individual was tagged. Then for each photo video 

As before further recursion is optional. In order to conserve resources only names or other references need be downloaded rather than the entire data.

In the first iteration of step assume that the profile of the target individual is closed i.e. unavailable to the public.

Use leads developed in step to find other profiles and search for references to target individual within the other profiles.

Essentially a method according to this embodiment method involves addition of a context social entity matching mechanism to procedure of in which scores are assigned to entities having no identifiable account.

In addition to using regular identifiers for cross matching the system attempts to unify similar named entities according to social circles. For example although there may be many individuals named David within a social circle there is usually at least one such individual who lacks have an account on the list of web sites. Such individuals are referred to herein as ghosts . Profiles referred to herein as ghost profiles are compiled on such ghosts. Subscribers referring to the ghosts are treated as friends. The ghosts may be tracked by the system using a group DIP including nicknames and references in posts photos and emails when available. The GUI may highlight ghost profiles according in the Group DIP and in a target DIP. This may result in the exposure of people of interest who are friends of the ghost in the real world but who lack have a social networking account. Thus while the target lacks a social network account others have a social network account and mention the target in their feeds.

Reference is now made to which is method of constructing a dossier of an individual lacking an explicit presence on a web site e.g. a social networking site according to an alternate embodiment of the present disclosure. The discussion of process steps that are identical to steps in are not repeated in the interest of brevity.

After performing step a ghost target individual is identified in step details of which are presented below. This may result in identification of individuals other than the intended target individual. To unify references and eliminate such false positive identifications an entity matching procedure is carried out in step . The entity matching procedure disclosed in the above noted U.S. application Ser. No. 13 187 438 may be used.

Reference is now made to which is a flow chart of a method of identifying a ghost target individual in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.

The web sites listed in initial step are scanned for references to an individual having properties identified in step referred to hereinbelow as target properties . In initial step a web site is selected.

Control now proceeds to decision step where it is determined if a reference to a candidate having the target properties. If the determination at negative then control proceeds to decision step which is described below.

If the determination at decision step is affirmative then control proceeds to decision step where it is determined if the candidate has a social networking account. This may be done by scanning the list of web sites listed in initial step . If the determination at decision step is affirmative then it is concluded that the candidate is not a ghost and is therefore ignored. Control returns to decision step to see if the current subscriber has referred to more candidates.

If the determination at decision step is negative then a ghost has been identified. Control proceeds to step in which details of the ghost and the current subscriber are recorded for later use in an entity matching procedure.

Control now proceeds to decision step where it is determined if there are more subscribers to evaluate in the current web site. If the determination at decision step is affirmative then control returns to step .

If the determination at decision step is negative then control proceeds to decision step where it is determined if more web sites remain to be evaluated. If the determination at decision step is affirmative then control returns to initial step .

If the determination at decision step is negative then control proceeds to final step . The procedure ends. The data accumulated in step is available for entity matching as described above.

The goal of the first part is to retrieve leads either by requesting the operator to add accounts manually or by offering recommendations for possible users and groups that might be used as initial leads to the target individual and requesting the operator to approve them. Afterwards the operator clicks reconstruct life and the process runs independently based on the inputs and other automatically developed leads that the system obtains for example downloading the target s public wall and using friends as initial leads .

The following steps are conducted automatically though reflected to the user via a graphical user interface GUI . The operator is not asked to intervene until the profile of the target individual is assembled.

Manual inputs In order to reach the leads an input wizard is displayed to the operator. The latter allows the user to supply leads in the form of accounts of groups or people which might be connected to the target individual.

Operator assisted inputs. In order to ease the process this portion of the wizard already contains a list of automatically detected relevant groups. This can be achieved according to one of the following options 

Groups that have appeared in the target individual s public profile and are under the categories employer or school.

Groups that have appeared in his public profile other than school or employer but have fewer than a predetermined number e.g. friends suggesting that they are not general fan pages but are conveying his real world interests and social life.

Suggested groups that have previously been recognized and are relevant to known information concerning the target individual e.g. work place. For example the operator or an investigator has entered Latin Kings and the system automatically fetches relevant groups from Facebook. In this example URLs themselves accounts are not directly available. Rather they are derived from inputs from the operator that resulted in suggested groups. Some are relatively more relevant than others and may be highlighted in the GUI and subsequently improved in the future through a group matching mechanism based on social context.

User accounts that are were downloaded and recognized as connected to the target individual either from the target s profile itself. For example he may have listed them on his friend lists as siblings or from another account already existing in the database.

Suggested accounts similar to suggested groups based on names entered by the investigator that are auto refreshed using an application programming interface API and allow an operator assisted choice of the relevant ones e.g. via a dynamic combo box in the GUI. To that end an entity matching mechanism as described in the above reference U.S. application Ser. No. 13 187 438 may be applied.

The GUI is designed to encourage the investigator to add users rather than groups since they are the goal of the initial process.

Additionally or alternatively the system may generate leads independently without consulting with the user. This may be achieved by use of the publicly available data in the target individual s account. For example if the wall is open it would download the users who published posts on the wall and use them in order to search for the first leads since there is a relatively large likelihood that they are friends of the target individual. Further additionally or alternatively information regarding the target individual may be found by correlating other targets with properties of the current target individual for example by finding a link based on common context and applying the entity matching process based on the other targets.

The system displays the search process to the user and alert him on its progress. The GUI focuses on the following steps 

Searching the initial definitive friends in order to start the iterative process that builds the target individual s social circles.

Expanding the social circle through an iterative process based on the accounts recognized in the step above. This may be achieved by displaying real data e.g. by drawing a dynamic diagram of the target individual s social circle during its construction showing his friends and their mutual connections.

Reconstructing target individual s life through his social circle by recognizing events published on public accounts and connecting them to target individual s profile page in the system posts likes groups pictures etc that were found during the process.

After lead gathering the system starts an iterative process in order to reach some predetermined number of friends e.g. friends that allows initiation of another iterative process that generates the social circle followed by a insertion step in which entity matching analysis is conducted in order to determine what portions of friends activity include the target. Typically the system does not request leads. Rather It asks via the wizard for whatever leads are possible and then tries to achieve initial leads automatically based on the operator provided leads and leads gathered automatically.

The system alerts the operator that a target individual s life has been reconstructed. It allows him to jump to a dynamic investigation page DIP which is an internally maintained profile of the target individual. The system and highlights via notifications the new relevant data that has been unveiled.

If the process stops clicking again on reconstruct the targets life for a target that was already reconstructed results in a notification that the system will expand the target individual s social circles even more and will restart without requesting leads again.

In case the system was unable to retrieve the first 10 leads or compensate and build an acceptable social circle from a limited number of leads it alerts the operator and ask for more input.

It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present disclosure is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather the scope of the disclosure includes both combinations and sub combinations of the various features described hereinabove as well as variations and modifications thereof that are not in the prior art which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description.
