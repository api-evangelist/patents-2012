The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention relates to displays gaming devices including displays and methods where a video display is provided. More particularly it relates to such displays and methods where the display has an interior opening to provide for the operation of a mechanical device or for viewing of another display.

Gaming machines have been developed having various features to capture and maintain player interest. Some features are directed to increasing or providing the player with the opportunity to win larger sums of money. For example gaming machines may include second chance games that provide a player with additional opportunities to obtain a winning outcome. Alternatively gaming machines may be tied into progressive gaming systems that award large progressive jackpots.

In addition to providing players with more opportunities to obtain a winning outcome or win a large sum of money gaming machines have increased the number of features and grown in sophistication in order to increase player participation or interest in a game. For example the mechanical reels of traditional gaming machines have been replaced with video depictions of spinning reels. These video gaming machines provide a richer gaming experience for players by including graphics or animation as part of the game. However overly complex video displays on a gaming machine may turn off player participation because players become frustrated with the game or are unwilling to learn or decipher all the information provided on the video display. Accordingly there is a continuing need for slot machines variants that provide a player with enhanced excitement without departing from the original slot machine gaming concept.

In relation to gaming device displays it has been known to provide video displays of game related content. Initially these displays were CRT displays however modernly such displays are LCD displays. These displays are controlled by one or game controller s to display for example video representations of spinning reels to produce a game outcome or a bonus feature such as a game or task to be provided by a player to produce a bonus outcome.

It has been known to provide openings in a LCD display to for example expose another display such as a display of game reels. For example an LCD may be placed over a secondary display for the game electro mechanical reels. Where the LCD is a backlit LCD via an edge lighting process this has been done by removing portions of various substrates to create one or more openings to expose the reels such as portions of the backlight and light guide plate such that the LCD for those portions can be transparent. However since other portions of the LCD remain intact such as polarizers color filters and the LCD panel the view through the opening is cloudy particularly when viewed at an angle to the display. This inability to provide for a clear view of the underlying display has detracted from the use of such arrangements.

As a further drawback of the prior art cutting a whole or opening in the interior of an LCD to accommodate for example a mechanical pass through such as a drive shaft or for clear viewing of a second underlying display cannot be done without damaging the LCD.

There is set forth according to an aspect of the present invention a gaming device which includes a cabinet. An electronic video first display device is provided on the cabinet the first display including at least two sub displays which are mated together to define a video frame surrounding an interior opening. A second display component either extends through or is viewable through the interior opening. A controller controls the first and second displays to display selected game graphics text game elements and features surrounding the opening.

In one embodiment the sub displays are L shaped and are mated to define said opening as rectangular circular triangular or polygonal.

In a further embodiment the second display is a mechanical component which extends through the opening. The mechanical component may be a shaft to control the movement of for example a pointer slide or other mechanical device which may cooperate with the first display to present one or more game features to the player.

In another embodiment the second display includes one or more mechanical reels configured as a second display to rotate to present an outcome and which is viewable through the opening. Inasmuch as the LCD sub displays are not penetrated by an opening or have not had portions such as the backlight panel and light guide plate removed the sub displays can be controlled to display the desired video content leaving the opening clear for viewing of the mechanical reels.

In still a further embodiment the second display is a video display viewable through the opening. The second display may be flat or a curved LCD or a curved screen for display by a digital light projector DLP as disclosed in U.S. Published Application 2009 0258701 titled Gaming Machine Having a Molded Curved Display filed May 11 2009 by Crowder et al the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Again inasmuch as the LCD sub displays are not penetrated by an opening or have not had portions such as the backlight panel and light guide plate removed the sub displays can be controlled to display the desired video content leaving the opening clear for viewing of the second display.

There is also set forth a method for displaying graphical images at a gaming device which includes securing at least two video sub displays mated to define a video frame about an interior opening and locating the first display to cooperate with a second display component which can be a mechanical component extending through the opening or a mechanical or video component viewable through the opening. In one embodiment the method includes securing two L shaped video sub displays to define said video display frame surrounding a rectangular opening. The method also includes controlling the first and second displays to display game content to a player.

The displays gaming device and methods provide a video display positioned as a frame about an opening. The opening can be used to pass a mechanical component such as a shaft for a rotatable pointer or may be used for viewing of a mechanical or video second display. The view of the second display is not distorted since the opening does not include any polarizers or LCD panel. A touch screen which is transparent may be positioned over the entire first display or only commensurate with the sub displays.

The peripherals may include the displays as hereinafter described with reference to the various embodiments of the present invention as herein described or their equivalents. For example the bill voucher acceptor is typically connected to the game input output board of the EGM processing board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. The I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. EGM processor board executes a game program that causes the gaming terminal to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming terminal cabinet .

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle button such as a SPIN RESET button or a touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays such as the primary game display as shown in . In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming terminal for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally EGM processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the outcome to an award schedule. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering and play of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset EGM processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on the primary game display and or any secondary display s .

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In an embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the gaming terminal are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming terminal using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to the card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player tracking module and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus player tracking display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive player tracking display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the player tracking display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

PTMs are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming terminal . The system components include the player tacking module e.g. Bally iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

The system components include the PTM processing board and game monitoring unit GMU . The GMU and PTM can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming terminal processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of an operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard EGM processing board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional game application API as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The high level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in manager and cash out manager call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like game event log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. Random number generator manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

The gaming system among other functionalities such as slot accounting i.e. monitoring the amount wagered drop awards paid and other casino services includes the player tracking CMS CMP server and or data warehouse storing player account data. This data includes personal data for players enrolled in the casino players club sometimes referred to as a loyalty club. An example of the personal data is the player s name address SSN birth date spouse s name and perhaps personal preferences such as types of games preferences regarding promotions and the like. As is known in the industry and according to the prior art at enrolment the player is assigned a created account in the player tracking CMS CMP server and is issued a player tracking card having a machine readable magnetic stripe.

When a player plays a gaming terminal he she inserts their player tracking card into the card reader which communicates data to the CMS CMP server to accumulate loyalty points based upon the wagers wins of the player. For example a player may accumulate one loyalty point for each 5 wagered.

The system may also include electronic transfer of funds functionality. For example a player having accumulated 100 at a gaming terminal may decide to cash out to play another gaming terminal. The player for example using the PTM to initiate communication with the system for example server to upload the value from the gaming terminal into an electronic account associated with the player s account. The player may choose to upload all or a portion of the funds the player s established electronic account. The system would prompt the player to enter their PIN or obtain biometrical confirmation as to the player s identity and upload the chosen amount to their account. When the player moves to another gaming terminal he she inserts their player loyalty card into the card reader to access their account. A prompt provides for the player to request funds from their account. Entering their PIN or biometric identifier the player can input the desired amount which is downloaded to their gaming terminal for play.

Turning to embodiments of the gaming terminal displays and methods of the present invention are described. In one embodiment as shown in the display is configured to accommodate a component viewable through an opening shown as a mechanical rotatable pointer . The display includes electronic video sub displays which may be LCD plasma OLED or other electronic video display. As shown each sub display may have an L shape. The L shape of the sub displays enables the LCD panel to be controlled inasmuch as the matrix of thin film transistor TFT switching devices and controls therefore remains intact. That is an attempt to bore or cut an interior opening in an LCD would disturb the matrix. For example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 961 166 issued Jun. 14 2011 and titled Liquid Crystal Display Device Driving Apparatus Thereof and Driving Method Thereof the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference discloses an LCD having a matrix of cells controlled by an m n matrix of data and gate lines. Cutting or boring a hole through the interior of the LCD would disturb the matrix and prevent control of at least a portion of the matrix and LCD. By fashioning the sub panels to be continuous the matrix remains undisturbed and the cells of the LCD panel can be controlled for operation of the LCD. Each LCD panel includes cold cathode fluorescent lighting such as edge lighting as shown.

The sub panels are mated together as shown in to define the rectangular LCD video display frame surrounding an interior opening . By configuring the dimensions of the L shaped margins of the sub panels the shape and dimensions of the opening can be as desired. In the embodiment shown in the opening is sized to accommodate a second display element shown as the pointer and more particularly it accommodates the driving shaft which extends though the display to mount the pointer for controlled rotation of the pointer as hereinafter described. The opening may accommodate other aspects of the second display such as a driver for a mechanical slider wheel or other mechanical device.

To control the images displayed on the display one or more controllers may be provided and may be mounted to the backside of one or both of the sub displays . One or more power supply units may also be mounted to the backside of one or more of the sub displays . It should be understood that the controller s and power supply ies could also be mounted elsewhere and connected to the sub panels in a known fashion. The controller s may be coupled to the EGM processor Board for control of the sub displays in coordination to the game functionality. While not shown the shaft is connected to a driving motor which is likewise preferably controlled by the EGM processor Board .

The display sub displays include sandwiched L shaped panels including the reflector light guide and LCD panel diffusers polarisers and LCD panel. The supporting structures of the 520 L shaped panels when mated together to define the display may create at the mated margins 510 bands or lines which may be visible to the player. These lines may be masked by other means such as masking overlays or the like. In an alternative embodiment certain panels of the display may be the same size as the overall display with interior openings with the LCD panel and polarisers being L shaped.

Returning to the display may be mounted to define the secondary game display for the gaming device . As but an example of the operation of the display the player may obtain an outcome at the primary game display entitling the player to a feature game played at the secondary game display . The display is controlled to display images such as a space scene with several values displayed as well. The player is prompted to activate the second display which controls the pointer to rotate and eventually point to an award to the player. Since the display has the interior opening to accommodate the second display mechanical pointer the entertainment value for the feature game is enhanced. Since LCDs are destroyed by a penetration required by the shaft of the pointer the present invention enables the game designers to create such features.

Turning to a further embodiment of the invention is illustrated. In this embodiment the display is configured to have sub displays defining a video frame surrounding an opening through which a second display can be viewed. In this embodiment the second display is one or more electro mechanical of video reels shown as three reels . It should be understood that the opening and second display may be configured to display for example three reels . For example the second display may be a separate video LCD OLED plasma or other video display displaying three to five reels as well as other game features or it may be a number of electro mechanical stepper reels. The reels as is well known display game symbols for the play of the game and game outcomes defined by those symbols or combinations thereof. In another embodiment the second display may be a video display of a Keno Poker Bingo Blackjack or other game. The display may display messages and graphics associated and or in coordination with the game played on the second display advertising messages game information such as meters credits available credits bet credits won number of pay lines wagered upon amount wagered per pay line and the like. The display may also display system related messages to the player such as the status of the player s account and the like.

Since the opening does not require the player to look through diffusers polarisers or the LCD panel as is the case according to the prior art the view of the second display is not blurred darkened obscured or subject to viewing angle distortion.

To provide touch screen input functionality a touch screen may be provided over the entire area of the display and second display or over a portion of the displays. Since the touch screen is transparent it would not affect the view of the first and second displays .

The sub displays as stated above may be L shaped rectangular triangular or any other shape which maintains the display control functionality of the display while still providing for the opening . To mask the seam margins between the mated sub displays the touch screen overlay may have masking material disposed to mask the aforesaid seam.
