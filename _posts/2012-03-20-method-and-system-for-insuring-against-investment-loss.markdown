This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 104 615 filed May 10 2011 which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 800 348 filed May 13 2010 now U.S. Pat No. 7 987 133 both of which claim priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 074 659 filed Feb. 12 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 720 736 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 724 972 filed Mar. 16 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 739 177 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. Nos. 60 288 669 filed on May 4 2001 and 60 299 084 filed on Jun. 18 2001 naming Brian Yolles as the inventor all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention relates to investment instruments and more particularly to a method and system for creating and using a loss reduction fund to compensate investors with investment losses.

There are known insurance systems to compensate for various losses. There are also various techniques for controlling investment losses such as through puts and calls. However there is no technique or product that can be used by investors to spread risk of investment loss across a group of investors thereby offsetting or reducing investment losses.

What is needed is a method and system to spread or allocate investment risk over a number of investors to provide reductions in investment risk in return for payment of a premium.

The preceding description and citation of the foregoing documents is not to be construed as an admission that any of the description or documents are prior art relative to the present invention.

In one aspect the invention is a system and method for sharing risk of loss among a plurality of investment instrument holders. The method and system comprise aggregating premiums to form a loss reduction fund where the premiums are at least partially contributed by the plurality of holders. The method and system also comprise determining losses incurred by the plurality of holders at a predetermined time and reimbursing at least a portion of the losses incurred by the plurality of investment instrument holders. Reimbursement to a particular investment instrument holder is at least partially determined by the loss of the particular investment instrument holder with consideration for losses of the plurality of investment instrument holders.

In another aspect the invention is a system and method for creating a loss reduction fund. The method and system comprise defining an investment category for the fund and associating a plurality of investment instruments with the investment category. The method and system further comprises calculating premiums for each investment instrument where the premiums are held by the fund and at least partially used to reimburse losses of the investment instruments.

In another aspect the invention is a system and method for allocating funds from a loss reduction fund. The method and system comprise determining respective losses of a plurality of investment instruments and determining funds available in the loss reduction fund. The method and system further comprises calculating a loss threshold and allocating funds from the loss reduction fund according to the threshold.

The foregoing specific objects and advantages of the invention are illustrative of those which can be achieved by the present invention and are not intended to be exhaustive or limiting of the possible advantages that can be realized. Thus the objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the description herein or can be learned from practicing the invention both as embodied herein or as modified in view of any variations which may be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly the present invention resides in the novel parts constructions arrangements combinations and improvements herein shown and described.

The instant invention allows an investor to participate in a fund providing reimbursement for losses incurred over specific terms or periods of time. In one embodiment losses greater than a threshold level e.g. a percentage are reimbursed from the fund and losses less than the threshold level are absorbed by the individual investor. In another embodiment losses less than a threshold level e.g. a percentage are reimbursed from the fund and losses greater than the threshold level are absorbed by the individual investor. In another embodiment losses of the investor are reimbursed by another investor in return for an interest in future earnings or growth of the losing investor s portfolio. These and other embodiments are explained in greater detail below.

The various combination of these embodiments have the ability to significantly limit investor losses.

Referring to one embodiment of a system according to the invention includes a plurality of computers which are interconnected by network . Network is a wired or wireless local area network or wide area network. In one embodiment network is the Internet. Each of computers include a processor memory fixed code storage removable code storage input output and network interface all of which are interconnected by bus . Network interface connects computers to network .

Suppose participants in the method and system of the instant invention suffer losses totaling 10 million with a previously agreed upon sum of loss compensation at 6 million. To compensate participants for sustained losses the invention triggers a loss threshold mechanism whereby the system designates a given percentage or dollar amount that represents an amount of loss sustained by all system participants with a loss. For example suppose there are 10 institutional participants in a system who have losses totaling 10 million with each institution investing 5 million 

Suppose the previously agreed upon sum of distributable loss compensation is 6 million. If participants indeed suffered 10 million in losses and the system can compensate 6 million of these losses this therefore means that 4 million of sustained losses must remain losses. The allotment for loss compensation is made via the loss threshold mechanism.

Eight of ten institutional participants in the previous system sustain losses with an average loss of 1.25 million 25 percent of investment . One embodiment of the loss threshold mechanism of the invention works by assigning a percentage or amount of loss to each of these eight Participants With Losses PWL . This figure applies to all PWL unless the figure is greater than a given participant s loss. In other words Participant I who lost 2 percent of its investment receives no compensation if indeed all PWL must sustain a loss of 10 percent according to the loss threshold mechanism.

The loss threshold mechanism functions first by adding up all minor losses sustained by PWL. In the above example a minor loss is one equal to or less than 500 000 10 percent of investment . Hence the loss threshold mechanism first concludes that three of the eight PWL sustained minor losses. These minor losses total 850 000 or 21.25 percent of the 4 million figure representing the amount of sustained losses that must remain losses. As a result the system distributes loss across the remaining five PWL in such a way that they together sustain 3 150 000 in total losses.

The system divides 3 150 000 by five the number of remaining PWL. This yields the figure of 630 000 which represents the amount of loss which each remaining PWL must sustain i.e. all PWL will have their losses limited to 630 000 or 12.6 percent of each investment. Participants D H and I each of whom who did not sustain losses greater than 630 000 i.e. suffered minor losses will receive no compensation for their losses. However those five PWL who lost greater than 630 000 will be reimbursed for all funds lost beyond 630 000. In this simplified example all of the investors have the same amount of investment therefore allocation of a uniform percentage of loss is simple. However it is very unlikely that all investor make the same investment. Therefore determining a uniform percent of loss may be somewhat more complex as discussed in greater detail below.

Each participant to the system benefits in some fashion. First and foremost the invention provides a guaranteed limit for all participants on their potential losses depending on the amount of loss sustained by other participants. Participant J represents perhaps the most satisfied system participant for the system reduces his or her 73 percent loss to 12.6 percent.

In this fashion this system and method functions on ground similar to that of insurance corporations compensating those who suffer the greatest amounts of damage.

However the method and system of the invention does not currently exist most likely due to concern of a bear market. The system and method presented here however is profitable in any market for under this method loss compensation is limited and therefore allows for a revenue plan that is greater than the loss compensation. Hence the loss threshold mechanism serves to meet any and all market conditions.

In the previous example the 12.6 percent loss threshold represents the percentage which serves to demarcate the PWL into two categories those who receive loss compensation and those who do not. In other words those PWL with losses less than 12.6 percent sustain those losses while PWL with losses greater than 12.6 percent are reimbursed for all loss sustained beyond this level.

An apparatus or method which calculates this percentage represents part of the invention. Indeed it is this scalable figure which serve to insulate market downfalls.

A more detailed example that demonstrates the means of calculating a given system s loss threshold is provided below.

The previous example also makes evident the significant role of a previously agreed upon sum of money which can represent the amount of distributable loss compensation funds. The loss compensation funds can be funded using capital contributions from participants of the system at a flat rate such as for example 3 to 10 of the cost of the underlying security to be protected. The use of other types of funding is also contemplated. For example using a fixed sum of money agreed upon between the parties using a sum of money sufficient to pay a third party insurance premium or a sum of money to purchase a hedge designed to offset risk. All of these types of funding can be paid upfront when the transaction is entered into as a pay as you go system or even upon the termination of the period of coverage at the time when the loss threshold is calculated. The premiums can be contributed by investment holders and collected at a time before a risk of loss is shared. For example in a system designed to protect for loss over a period of 10 years the parties can agree to an annual funding of 1 of the value of the covered security at a regular anniversary date a value that is a fraction of a predetermined time of analysis or other regular time intervals between a time when the risk of loss begins and the predetermined time when losses or gains incurred by each of the investment instrument holders is calculated. In this example the figure of 6 million represented this figure.

Several possible sources exist for these compensation funds. First a company practicing the invention can function as a subsidiary of a large corporation and draw easily from corporate funds to set forward this sum and then work to ensure that revenue exceeds any given sum so as to guarantee a profit.

Also a company practicing the invention can establish a scheduling system whereby the company agrees to insure a given number of shares of a given security on a given date for a given period of time. For example the company would agree to insure for each trading day 100 000 shares of each security listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index for a time period of six months.

As part of this method and system the company would charge a premium that correlates with the total transaction value minus commission and S.E.C. fee of a stock purchase. For example for a 10 000 transaction the cost for participation in the system could be set at 3 percent or 300. In one embodiment the premiums collected are held as bonds such as ten years treasury bonds or other municipal bonds. In yet another embodiment the bonds are variable rate demand obligations. Interest collected from bonds or any other investment can be used to offset the premiums that must be collected or to pay fees associated with the management of the method described herein.

Referring to an embodiment for creating the loss reimbursement fund starts at step by selecting a group or sector of securities a premium and a term.

At step system calculates the loss reimbursement threshold and among for the participating investors.

In order to ensure the lowest possible loss threshold figure and thereby allow for the greatest number of compensated PWL clients a company practicing the invention may employ several strategies. For example the company may group clients with like investments by sector by beta or any number of other criteria. The company may group investments by purchase price categories e.g. all investors whose policies indicate a purchase of between 40 and 41 . The company also could group investors by trading day or hour by index or average equity volume or dollar amount invested.

There may be many different security class systems to enable the company to ensure the lowest possible loss threshold and thereby allow for the greatest number of compensated PWL clients and hence the highest degree of client satisfaction . The grouping strategies will likely differ according to market conditions.

In one embodiment a company practicing the invention focuses on clients with long term horizons who seek to purchase blue chip companies. In this embodiment the company uses a scheduling system for the purchasing of policies so as to enable the creation of security classes and hence avoid overexposure to any one security the company may also target investors who utilize a dollar cost averaging method of portfolio management. Regardless of the focus the desire for investment peace of mind is significant given the burgeoning numbers of investors who are now relying upon the securities markets for their retirement and children s educations.

The method and system may also work as part of the company web site or as part of financial service firm trading screens.

In this example a company practicing the invention begins protecting client transactions in DJIA securities beginning Nov. 1 2000 with coverage through Mar. 30 2001 approximately a five month time frame . It is assumed here that the company utilized a scheduling system and insured 100 000 shares of each DJIA security for each trading day.

The closing prices for each Dow security on Nov. 1 2000 and Mar. 30 2001 respectively Source Commodity Systems Inc. accessed via Yahoo Historical Quotes are as follows 

A security class signifies here a specific product category. For example if a company practicing the invention were to insure 100 000 shares of each security that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average one security class could represent the firm s 100 000 share insurance of Citigroup or Alcoa.

Although a company practicing the invention may establish a premium utilizing several strategies the example included here determines premiums at the rate of three percent of transaction values. The calculation of transaction value of any given security class is performed by multiplying the purchase price of the shares of a given class by the numbers of shares insured 100 000 shares in this example .

Example If 69.6250 represents the purchase price for the security class of Microsoft MSFT and a company practicing the invention insures 100 000 MSFT shares each trading day of the 6 month term the premium total for the Microsoft security class is 208 875 transaction value 6 962 500 with three percent of this figure yielding company revenue of 208 875 .

Total premiums for each security class in the system e.g. securities in the Dow . total revenue is 5 032 125 

The loss compensation fund figure denotes the sum of money that a company practicing the invention distributes to clients who sustain qualified losses.

In the example included here the total revenue is 5 032 125 and the loss compensation fund figure is set at 5 000 000.

This is a variable step and is typically established at the beginning of a coverage term. For example due to a scheduling system a company practicing the invention is able to reliably anticipate future revenues and thereby calculate an appropriate loss compensation fund for a given system in advance.

 End share price may represent the sale price of the security or the 4 p.m. closing value at the end of the covered term.

For the example included here the end share prices represent the closing trade values of Mar. 30 2001 which represents an approximately five month time period following purchases on Nov. 1 2000.

Example with the purchase price for the Intel security class 44.88 and the end share price 26.31 the system determines that 41.36 percent of the investment was lost i.e. 18.56 per share over the term of coverage.

In one embodiment the system and method also includes a means to allow clients to monitor the statuses of their insured products. If one security class shows a sizable loss but other securities have minor losses or gains it is probable that the client will receive significant compensation from the system to cover much of the sustained loss.

NOTE This method may also likely entail caps on loss ensuring that no one security can drain the resources of a given security class. Caps are discussed in greater detail below.

7. At step system calculates the total amount of loss dollars sustained by the system s clients. This is done by calculating the amount of loss dollars for each security class and adding these figures together.

Example In the example included here the figure 20 375 000 represents the total amount of loss dollars sustained by all clients who purchased into the system on Nov. 1 2000 and remained covered by their policies through Mar. 30 2001.

The example included here lists the security class showing the greatest gain at the bottom and the security class with the greatest loss at the top.

Because these appreciated security classes do not need compensation from the system they are automatically eliminated as candidates for compensation and thus designated as such by the word ELIMINATED. 

9. Using the total amount of loss dollars calculate the total number of loss dollars which the system must eliminate as unqualified for compensation according to previously agreed upon contract terms.

This calculation depends upon the figure representing the appropriate loss compensation fund figure. If the loss compensation fund is set at 5 000 000 and client losses total 20 375 000 the system must eliminate as unqualified a total of 15 375 000.

10. Using the unqualified losses the system and method eliminates as unqualified the amount of sustained loss dollars according to contract terms steps .

In one embodiment this entails an elimination utilizing a loss threshold percentage applied to all participants of a given system. If a security class suffers a loss greater than the loss threshold percentage a portion of the sustained loss will be marked as qualified for compensation the portion of loss that is sustained below the loss threshold percentage is marked as unqualified.

In the example included here the system must mark a total of 15 375 000 loss dollars as unqualified. In one embodiment the system and method begins with the security class showing the lowest percentage loss. In this case J.P. Morgan Chase represents this security class sustaining a 1.72 percent loss. The system proceeds by eliminating as unqualified this loss. The number of loss dollars sustained as part of this 1.72 percent decline 78 750 are registered separately and applied against the 15 375 000 figure representing the number of dollars which the firm must mark as unqualified.

Significantly as previously explained the system also calculates the amount of unqualified dollars which a 1.72 percent loss yields when applied to all other security classes with losses that are part of the given system. In other words if the loss sustained by clients who purchased into the J.P. Morgan Chase security class represents the only security class which the system must eliminate then all other clients with losses would deduct 1.72 percent from their sustained loss percentage to ensure equitable treatment of all clients with losses. If however such an applied percentage deduction yields a figure that is greater than the amount of loss dollars needing to be marked unqualified the system proceeds to Step Eleven and thereby utilizes a formula to calculate a percentage applied to all security classes within a given system.

In the example included here the system necessitates 14 calculations to determine that the loss threshold lies between 15.519 percent and 16.047 percent. The first thirteen of these calculations are denoted ELIMINATED 1 ELIMINATED 2 ELIMINATED 3 ELIMINATED 4 ELIMINATED 5 ELIMINATED 6 ELIMINATED 7 ELIMINATED 8 ELIMINATED 9 ELIMINATED 10 ELIMINATED 11 ELIMINATED 12 and ELIMINATED 13. The fourteenth calculation which informed the system that the marking of all losses sustained by clients of the McDonald s security class should not be eliminated and are hence not entirely unqualified is denoted RESTORE 14 COMPENSATED. This means that the McDonald s loss percentage 16.047 percent is greater than the system s loss threshold and therefore that the total loss dollars associated with this security class should not be separately registered with the wholly eliminated security classes of the previous thirteen calculations i.e. those with losses lower than the loss threshold .

This therefore also means that all security classes above McDonald s i.e. those with loss percentages that are greater than the loss threshold have portions of their loss that are qualified for compensation namely the amount of dollars which represent the amount that causes the security class s loss percentage to reside above the system s loss threshold. As can be noted on the chart all securities with loss percentages greater than that of McDonald s 16.047 percent qualify for some amount of compensation.

11. Calculate the exact loss threshold of the system which is between 15.519 percent and 16.047 percent.

Before proceeding to the formula it is necessary to add up the total number of dollars eliminated as part of the wholly eliminated security classes i.e. those that are separately registered .

For the example included here it is evident that the wholly eliminated security classes those from J.P. Morgan Chase to General Motors yield 7 448 250 loss dollars which are marked unqualified. Because the system originally determined in Step Nine that the system must mark as unqualified 15 375 000 dollars it is necessary to now subtract 7 448 250 from 15 375 000 to determine the number of dollars which remain to be marked as unqualified. This subtraction yields the figure of 7 926 750.

To calculate the system s loss threshold the system utilizes here the following formula transaction value of security class transaction value of security class transaction value of security class . . . figure representing the number of dollars which remain to be marked as unqualified in this case 7 926 750 

The left side of the equation should comprise all security classes with losses that qualify for compensation.

Returning to the example provided here the security classes from Intel to McDonald s should be represented 

Hence the loss threshold for this system is 15.5293253 percent meaning that All security classes with percentage losses above this threshold sustain a loss up to but no greater than this figure.

Hence the system ensures that all participants will not sustain losses greater than 15.5293253 percent.

If a client purchased 100 shares of Intel on Nov. 1 2000 at 44.88 per share held onto those shares through Mar. 30 2001 and had purchased an insurance policy for approximately 134 on Nov. 1 2000 the client would be compensated 1 159 by this system on Mar. 30 2001. Uninsured this client would have suffered a loss of 41.365 percent or 1 857. Because he or she was insured however the client only suffers a loss that is limited to the system s threshold which is 15.529 percent in this case.

Significantly the system is presently imagined as distributing compensation to clients even if they do not sell their insured securities in the open market. This therefore may represent a significant value proposition for long term investors.

Ideally this system and method also includes the means by which these compensations are processed and delivered to clients.

Important note As briefly noted earlier the company practicing the invention can employ several strategies to reduce the average loss threshold and thereby increase client compensation. One strategy entails comprehensive and complex diversification.

Security classes also may be formed on the basis of sector index share price purchase date security beta or any number of factors.

 The firm may seek client permission to verify purchase price with brokerage or request copies of the client s brokerage statement. The firm also may develop its own system whereby trade execution data for insured transactions are immediately and automatically processed. 

You will be billed 3 percent of the total value of this transaction not including the commission of your broker.

 If you do not enter a purchase price the company will assume your purchase occurred at the highest ask price of the day. 

 The company also may have a select your premium program with a range for example of between 1 and 5 percent of transaction values depending on the amount of the loss compensation fund desired by the client and hence probability for compensation . 

8. The client is then informed that he or she may sell his or her shares whenever he or she wishes. If the client sells for a gain or small loss the company may decide to reward this client with points applicable toward frequent flyer miles hotel and other incentive programs. This provides the firm with promotional opportunities to persons in the money. 

If a client sells and suffers a significant loss he or she may be compensated automatically via their brokerage account provided with credit toward additional insurance protection policies mailed a check and or a variety of other possibilities.

Upon the sale of insured securities the client visits www. company name .com and sign in. He or she will then see a screen showing the shares that are insured. The client is provided the opportunity to enter the sale price. If at the end of the policy s coverage period the client s sustained loss qualifies for compensation the client s credit card or account will be credited. In a related business model a third party intermediary sets up a pool with a plurality of investment instrument holders to share a risk of loss. The program is advertised and sold as an auxiliary product and information and evidence from a brokerage firm or any other holder of equity is given as to the ownership interest to be covered. The brokerage firm can confirm the initial position in the investment or any subsequent position in the investment instrument held by any of the investment instrument holders.

For several reasons it is in the best interest of financial services firms to integrate this system and method within their operations. The company would hope to become part of the trading screens of private client operations of financial service firms worldwide. Some of the benefits the invention provides to financial services firms include 

Prevention of developing the disgruntled client who loses significant quantities of money to the market blames the broker and transfers funds to a competing firm.

The system and method for the control or limitation of individual or institutional losses can be tailored to virtually any commodity or investment instrument that involves fluctuating market value both in the United States and around the world. These include 

The system and method for the control or limitation of individual or institutional losses can also be tailored to include virtually any tangible or intangible item with fluctuating value both in the United States and around the world. These include but are not limited to stocks bonds futures options derivatives funds trusts currencies commodities residential real estate commercial real estate artistic works antiques collectibles intellectual property assets American Depository Receipts ADR or American Depository Shares ADS .

A security class signifies here a specific product category. For example if a company practicing the invention were to insure 100 000 shares of each security that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average one security class could represent the firm s 100 000 share insurance of Citigroup or Alcoa.

Although a company practicing the invention may establish a premium utilizing several strategies the example included here determines premiums at the rate of three percent of transaction values ten percent or any other value taken up front as a pay as you go or at the time when the threshold is calculated. In one embodiment the calculation of transaction value of any given security class is performed by multiplying the purchase price of the shares of a given class by the numbers of shares insured 100 000 shares in this example .

Example If 69.6250 represents the purchase price for the security class of Microsoft MSFT and a company practicing the invention insures 100 000 MSFT shares each trading day of the 6 month term the premium total for the Microsoft security class is 208 875 transaction value 6 962 500 with three percent of this figure yielding company revenue of 208 875 . The above example is given with a premium of three percent. At ten percent with the same shares the value will be 696 250. If the payment is taken upfront an amount of 500 000 could be agreed upon. This payment can also be offset by any interest obtained from bonds invested using the sum taken upfront.

Total premiums for each security class in the system e.g. securities in the Dow . Total revenue is 5 032 125 .

The loss compensation fund figure denotes the sum of money that a company practicing the invention distributes to clients who sustain qualified losses step .

In the example included here the total revenue is 5 032 125 and the loss compensation fund figure is set at 5 000 000. In the above embodiment the fund covers the revenue but as explained below the amount of protection can be varied at will.

This is a variable step and is typically established at the beginning of a coverage term. For example a company practicing the invention is able to reliably anticipate future revenues and thereby calculate an appropriate loss compensation fund for a given system in advance. For example if risky instruments are to be protected the fund can offer a protection of 25 on the downside. For funds made of less risky instruments like municipal bonds the fund can offer protection of only 10 on the downside. What is contemplated is the placement of the level of protection based on a plurality of factors including but not limited to the market anticipated evolution the economy uncertainty long term political movements and any other factors affecting overall risk and need for downside protection.

 End share price may represent the sale price of the security or the 4 p.m. closing value at the end of the covered term.

For the example included in the previous papers the end share prices represent the closing trade values of Mar. 30 2001 which represents an approximately five month time period following purchases on Nov. 1 2000.

Example With the purchase price for the Intel security class 44.88 and the end share price 26.31 the system determines that 41.36 percent of the investment was lost i.e. 18.56 per share over the term of coverage.

In one embodiment the system and method also includes a means to allow clients to monitor the statuses of their insured products. If one security class shows a sizable loss but other securities have minor losses or gains it is probable that the client will receive significant compensation from the system to cover much of the sustained loss. NOTE This method may also likely entail caps on loss discussed in greater detail below ensuring that no one security can drain the resources of a given security class.

This is done by calculating the amount of loss dollars for each security class and adding these figures together step .

Example In the example included in previous papers the figure 20 375 000 represents the total amount of loss dollars sustained by all clients who purchased into the system on Nov. 1 2000 and remained covered by their policies through Mar. 30 2001.

The example included here lists the security class showing the greatest gain at the bottom and the security class with the greatest loss at the top.

Because these appreciated security classes do not need compensation from the system they are automatically eliminated as candidates for compensation and thus designated as such by the word ELIMINATED. 

9. Using the total amount of loss dollars calculate the total number of loss dollars which the system must eliminate as unqualified for compensation according to previously agreed upon contract terms steps .

This calculation depends upon the figure representing the appropriate loss compensation fund figure. If the loss compensation fund is set at 5 000 000 and client losses total 20 375 000 the system must eliminate as unqualified a total of 15 375 000.

10. Using the unqualified losses the system and method eliminates as unqualified the amount of sustained loss dollars according to contract terms.

In one embodiment this entails an elimination utilizing a reversed loss threshold percentage applied to all participants of a given system. If a security class suffers a loss greater than the loss threshold percentage that portion of the sustained loss will be marked as unqualified for compensation and be applied against the figure yielded by Step Nine the portion of loss that is sustained below the loss threshold percentage is marked as qualified for compensation.

In the example above the system must mark a total of 15 375 000 loss dollars as unqualified. Toward this end the method described here begins with the security class showing the greatest percentage loss. In this case Intel shareholders represent this security class sustaining a 41.36 percent loss. The system proceeds by first eliminating the loss that separates the Intel security class from that of Hewlett Packard the security class sustaining the second greatest loss. Hewlett Packard shares declined 29.63 percent during this time period. The system subtracts 29.63 from 41.36 yielding 11.73. This latter figure represents the percentage amount that the system first eliminates as unqualified for compensation.

The number of loss dollars sustained as part of this 11.73 percent elimination about 526 384 is registered separately and applied against the 15 375 000 figure representing the number of dollars which the firm must mark as unqualified. The system then looks at the security class that presents the third greatest percentage loss. In this case that security class is American Express whose shares sustained a 29.25 percent decline. The system eliminates the loss percentage that separates the Hewlett Packard security class from that of American Express. The system subtracts 29.25 from 29.63 yielding 0.38. This percentage amount is eliminated from the Hewlett Packard total as well as the Intel percentage loss. This yields respectively 16 886 and 17 053 unqualified sustained loss dollars. These are again registered separately and applied against the 15 375 000 figure representing the number of dollars which the firm must mark as unqualified.

This process continues until too many sustained loss dollars are eliminated as unqualified. When this occurs the system reverses one step and eliminates only the percentage amount needed to meet the 15 375 000 figure representing the number of dollars which the firm must mark as unqualified. Returning to the example the system goes so far as to eliminate the loss percentage that separates the DuPont security class from that of Johnson Johnson subtracting as well the Johnson Johnson loss percentage figure from all security classes with greater losses and applying the new unqualified dollar figures against the 15 345 000 figure before realizing that this latter elimination yielded a total number of about 15 545 545 unqualified sustained loss dollars a figure that is 170 545 too many. This therefore means that the reversed loss threshold is between 3.88 percent and 7.37 percent i.e. we need to mark as qualified 170 545 additional dollars .

11. To calculate the system s reversed loss threshold the system utilizes here the following formula where x represents the loss threshold percentage 

The left side of the equation should comprise all security classes with partial losses that are among those marked as unqualified.

Returning to the example provided here the security classes from Intel to DuPont should be represented 

This leads to the equations 19538793.13 10291875015 375 000 10291875015 375 000 19538793.13 1029187504163793.13 4163793.13 102918750 0.04045708999

Hence the reversed loss threshold for this system is 4.0457 percent meaning that all losses below or less than this threshold are compensated. This is illustrated in .

When combined with what is identified here as forward oriented insurance i.e. the method detailed above a considerable measure of downside protection is secured.

Let us suppose a client purchased 100 shares of Intel on Nov. 1 2000 at 44.88 per share the optimal price for his or her security class. Let us suppose that no cap exists on the amount of insurable loss and that he or she held onto these shares for a six month time period through Mar. 30 2000 when the stock price closed at 26.31. Let us suppose as well that this client had purchased on Nov. 1 2000 both forward oriented and reverse oriented insurance policies for an approximate premium of 268. Uninsured this client would have suffered a loss of 41.365 percent or 1 857. Because he or she was doubly insured however the client only suffered a loss of about 11.52 percent excluding commissions and policy purchases. He or she received about 181 from the reverse oriented system 4.0457 percent of 4 488 the transaction value and approximately 1 159 from the forward oriented system. 

Including policy purchases the client s loss would have stood after compensation at about 17.49 percent. This loss could have been reduced further had the client written a covered call on his or her shares receiving that premium and if he or she had sold the declining shares upon sustaining a 20 percent loss. For this reason it is now recommended that this system operate with a cap of 20 percent on insurable loss. This provides clients with the motivation to monitor their investments and stem losses.

In one embodiment the system sets a cap on the amount of loss reimbursement. On example of a cap is illustrated in Here loss from zero to the loss threshold is uncompensated and loss greater than the cap is uncompensated. However loss that is greater than the loss threshold and less than the cap is compensated.

The following explains another embodiment for transactions designated to occur on a running basis. This method eliminates the need for a system that utilizes a scheduling operation but it is nevertheless possible that this method and that which utilizes a scheduling mechanism may work alongside each other.

In describing this embodiment we will consider the pathway of one hypothetical equity transaction one purchase on Feb. 1 2000 of 3 000 shares of Winn Dixie Stores symbol WIN NYSE at the price of 19.50 per share.

This document utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System NAICS a method of classifying businesses that replaced Standard Industrial

One embodiment adopts the first half of this hierarchy. That is classification will occur on the basis of Industry Sector and Industry Subsector. In other embodiments the method is extended to Industry Group and Industry.

Significantly the NAICS divides economic activity into 20 sectors. The Manufacturing Sector however is too large for accurate equity diversification comprising 21 subsectors. Therefore it is preferable to divide the Manufacturing Sector into nine semi related groups each of which for the purposes of this document s embodiment will serve as its own sector 

2. Textile Mills 0307 Textile Product Mills 0308 Apparel Manufacturing 0309 Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing

3. Wood Product Manufacturing 0311 Paper Manufacturing 0312 Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing 0313 Printing and Related Support Activities

As part of one embodiment it is important to first define the ways in which a security class is formed. As an example two different levels of security classes are initially formed.

their Subsector e.g. Food and Beverage Stores within the Retail Trade sector Chemical Manufacturing within the Manufacturing sector .

In one embodiment for purposes of diversification an insured equity transaction undergoes three different rounds of loss compensation one based on the performance of the security s subsector 20 percent exposure one oriented around more generally the security s sector 20 percent exposure and one grounded in the performance of at least thirteen other sectors 60 percent to provide general macroeconomic exposure that is beyond subsector and sector performance.

If we assume that a sector security class is formed at the moment when it comprises a security class for each subsector then as soon as the sector security class is formed the sector security class becomes closed and the company begins to form a new security class for that given sector. For example as soon as the Mining sector security class comprises security classes for each of its three subsectors Oil and Gas Extraction Mining except Oil and Gas and Support Activities for Mining the security class for the Mining sector becomes closed to new participants.

Of course this suggests a need to define a subsector security class. If we assume that a subsector security class is formed at the moment when it generates a given amount of premiums then as soon as this amount of revenue generation is achieved the subsector security class becomes closed and the company begins work on forming a new security class for that given subsector. It is also at this moment that the subsector security class joins the security class of its sector.

For example as soon as those policies issued to cover shares of Oil and Gas Extraction companies reach a point of revenue generation in excess of 700 000 the Oil and Gas Extraction subsector s security class becomes closed to new participants. Subsequent requests for insurance for Oil and Gas Extraction subsector shares are funneled toward the creation of a new Oil and Gas Extraction subsector security class. The recently closed subsector security class for Oil and Gas Extraction joins the security class of the Mining sector which awaits other subsector security class formations.

As previously suggested the Mining sector security class is formed when each of its three subsectors generate at least 700 000 in revenue. This does not mean however that the Mining security class has available a loss compensation fund of 2.1 million. As previously noted for purposes of diversification an insured equity transaction will undergo three different loss compensation processes in an effort to provide general macroeconomic exposure that is beyond subsector and sector performance. The premiums generated by each subsector will be divided according to these percentages.

Separately but relatedly for the purposes of diversification a company practicing the invention may establish a rule such that no security shall comprise a given subsector s security class to an extent greater than its market share within that subsector. In other words if the Coca Cola Company controls 50 percent of the Beverage Manufacturing subsector of the Manufacturing sector then insurance for Coca Cola stock cannot exceed 50 percent of the Beverage Manufacturing subsector. Ideally however a company practicing the invention could create a rule such that no one stock can comprise more than about 30 percent of any given subsector security class ensuring considerable diversification.

The bottom line is that a subsector security class should approximate the financial hierarchy of that subsector without compromising diversification. This assumes of course that demand for equity insurance correlates roughly with market capitalizations and or market shares. If it does not then perhaps an even more balanced form of diversification is possible. Ultimately security class formation is designed to occur in a way that ensures that the principle of diversification remains intact.

INDIVIDUAL MATCHING. The very nature of security class formation allows for the development of an exciting and novel product feature the matching of individual clients and their positions. In other words a company practicing the invention is able to provide clients with non identifying lists of other individual clients with positions in a given subsector or perhaps provide an interactive medium in which a client can monitor but not impact the performance of other individuals positions within his or her transaction s subsector and sector. This potentially enjoyable form of monitoring the investments and price positions of others without identifying information represents a compelling product feature. A client may be interested in observing if other clients within a given subsector or sector class are liquidating their positions for profits or losses. A company practicing the invention can make this feature compelling also by creating or allowing for the formation of even smaller subsector and sector security classes with perhaps only a handful of clients in each.

RUNNING BASIS FORMATION. In one embodiment due to the rules established to ensure diversification within subsector security classes it may be necessary to have several different security classes for the same subsector simultaneously under formation. For example suppose a company practicing the invention receives an order to insure 100 000 shares of grocer Foodarama Supermarkets symbol. FSM AMEX at the price of 21 per share. With a market capitalization of approximately 25 million the company is decidedly small and the transaction is decidedly unusual representing almost 10 percent of the market capitalization. The mandate for diversification dictates its placement not within one Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class but rather several classes across what may be a long period of time. Hence the company may have numerous security classes for the same subsector under formation at the same time. In the hypothetical case of the Foodarama transaction a company practicing the invention could establish ten different security classes for the Food and Beverage Stores subsector and place 10 000 shares of the 100 000 share transaction into each.

OPTIMAL PRICE DETERMINATION. The principal obstacle to developing a system that utilizes a running basis method rested in the notion that few individuals would want to purchase into i.e. join a security class if he or she knew that most of the participants in that system already had losses on their positions meaning that the loss threshold percentage may be more likely to be high. Clients would therefore time their purchases into various security classes following upturns in the security or sector. This is problematic from a number of perspectives. It was thus determined that the solution to or avoidance of this problem could take at least two forms 

In one embodiment the invention forms security classes on hourly or daily bases this provides all participants with similar entry points into their positions and largely avoids the problem of clients timing their purchases to coincide only with rising markets or appreciated securities. However this embodiment may also compromise the principle of diversification if the company s underwriting volume is low.

In another embodiment the invention forms security classes over longer periods of time and the entry points of positions are established not according to the actual and varied entry points of clients but rather the optimal i.e. highest entry point of all security class participants with positions in a given security. In other words suppose a security class under formation includes two clients with insured positions in AOL Time Warner but different entry points one person Client A purchased her stock at 56 per share on Monday while the other Client B purchased his stock at 54 on Tuesday. A method that utilizes optimal price determination would effectively erase the 54 entry point of Client B and subsume it with the higher and hence more optimal from a loss compensation perspective entry point of Client A.

This benefits Client B because loss compensation allotment is then computed as though he entered the stock at 56 rather than 54. In other words even though Client B may have suspected that other clients had actual losses on their investments due to the decline in AOL Time Warner s stock price from Monday to Tuesday Client B had the incentive to join the system knowing that he would not join a group of losers risking a high loss threshold percentage but instead receives the most optimal entry point. In receiving this optimal entry point for his transaction Client B may ultimately receive an amount of loss compensation that is greater than his actual sustained loss if indeed Client B has a loss at the end of his coverage period and the loss compensation fund is large enough to yield a very low loss threshold percentage .

This method therefore encourages clients to secure the lowest entry point with the hope that the optimal price determination mechanism will assign to AOL Time Warner shareholding clients a price higher than their actual entry point. This method would largely avoid the timing problem. Although some may say that the timing problem would reverse with clients wanting in when stocks are on the decline the converse is also very much possible when stocks are on the rise clients would want in locking in the present price with the hope or expectation that the stock will continue to rise providing a higher optimal price . Indeed these are precisely the motivations that are involved with the assumption of most long positions in a security.

Suppose a client purchases Cisco Systems on Monday at 20 per share. Suppose the stock declines to 18 on Tuesday. Rather than hesitating to join this security class that already includes a client with a paper loss a different client on Tuesday decides without hesitation to join guided by the expectation that Cisco will rise and that he or she is capable through this association of receiving as his or her optimal entry price at least 20. Indeed according to this method Cisco s subsector security class would assume as its common entry point for Cisco shareholders that price which is most optimal for clients in this case if the 20 transaction is the highest of all class participants with positions in Cisco it represents the most optimal and would therefore become the security class s common entry point for Cisco shareholders. This method is included as part of the Winn Dixie example which is outlined below.

Significantly a company practicing the invention may reveal different levels of information to prospective clients about the composition of security classes under formation. If it is determined that forthright revelations compel clients to join security classes then certainly the company would strongly consider the continuation of such offers of information if indeed such offers do not violate client privacy and are equitable to all clients.

For the sake of simplicity none of the calculations here include dividends in determining loss compensation. However because dividends often provide significant returns and because in many cases a stock is owned less for capital appreciation and more for its dividend. In one embodiment the invention includes dividends in calculating loss compensation.

With this stated however a company practicing the invention may determine that many retail and institutional investors care very little about the dividends issued on their stocks and strongly prefer capital appreciation. In other words a significant amount of distributed dividends could be funneled toward greater investor value and satisfaction if applied toward equity insurance by the investor s company on behalf of individual shareholders who opt for such dividend reinvestment and convenience. In this way dividend reinvestment in equity insurance represents a reinvestment in their company. This type of equity insurance promotes price stability and appreciation in addition to heightened investor confidence through perceived decreases in risk.

In furthering these interests a company practicing the invention may seek to institute a program through which public companies purchase insurance for their shareholders by utilizing shareholder dividends with shareholder permission . Such a purchase would further the interests of public companies in the promotion of price stability appreciation and investor confidence.

It is now appropriate to see all of the aforementioned method in action and also add some information along the way. In doing so as previously noted we will focus on the hypothetical transaction of a purchase of 3 000 shares of Winn Dixie Stores symbol WIN NYSE purchased on Feb. 1 2000 at the price of 19.50 per share. With a transaction value excluding commissions of 58 500. A three percent of transaction value premium of 1 755 insures this equity position for six months. At this ratio a six percent premium would insure the equity position for a year. While one value is given by way of example what is contemplated is any value of premium collected before during or after the period of protection of the risk of loss.

Upon receiving and processing this order the policy is placed within the appropriate subsector and sector security classes under formation. Winn Dixie is a part of the Food and Beverage Stores subsector of the Retail Trade sector.

Let us suppose that the Food and Beverage Stores subsector below started formation on Jan. 24 2000. Let us suppose as well that the purchase of 3 000 shares of Winn Dixie on Feb. 1 2000 represented the transaction that pushed the subsector security class s revenue generation beyond 167 000 a level that completes and closes this security class to new participants. Let us then suppose that on Feb. 1 2000 the Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class consisted of these albeit exaggerated transactions listed by company and beneath each company name in chronological order 

 For purposes of diversification let us say here that shares of the nation s largest grocer are not allowed to comprise more than half of the grocer subsector security class. Policy purchases beyond this limit are not problematic however our company would form another security class for the Food and Beverage Stores subsector and simultaneously form it alongside this security class. 

According to this example the purchase on Feb. 1 of insurance covering 3 000 shares of Winn Dixie Stores pushed the revenue figure generated by the Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class beyond 167 000. Indeed the revenue point prior to this purchase rested at 166 608.76 according to the figures above. The Winn Dixie purchase however compelled a new revenue total for the subsector of 168 363.76. This effectively closed this Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class to new participants and impelled its binding to the encompassing retail sector security class under formation.

Like subsector security classes a sector security class is defined here by its amount of generated revenue. Because each sector has a varying number of subsectors the amount of generated revenue for each subsector security class differs according to the needs of the sector security class. Let us suppose an important rule here is that each sector security class should generate approximately 1 million in revenue. Hence the amount of generated revenue that defines each subsector security class depends on the needs of the sector security class. A sector security class is defined as a group of subsector security classes.

Significantly a sector security class does not need to include a security class for each subsector. Because subsector security classes will form at varying times some longer and some shorter it is most efficient to define a sector security class as comprising at least half of the number of subsectors within a given sector. For example the Retail Trade sector happens to have 12 subsectors. According to our criteria for defining a sector security class it is only necessary for a retail sector security class to comprise six subsector security classes i.e. at least half of 12 . This allows for considerable flexibility in forming sector security classes and does not compel rapid and premature formation of laggard subsector security classes.

It is necessary that each Retail Trade subsector security class generate approximately 167 000 in revenue. When six of these retail subsector security classes are joined together to comprise a retail sector security class an entity representing about 1 million in generated revenue is formed.

So let us suppose that on Feb. 1 2000 a company practicing the invention had overseen the formation of five Retail Trade subsector security classes one each for the subsectors entitled Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Gasoline Stations Motor Vehicles and Parts Dealers Health and Personal Care Stores and General Merchandise Stores. With the completion of the Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class on Feb. 1 2001 a company practicing the invention would then conjoin all six of these completed security classes to comprise a retail sector security class.

Meanwhile the company would have been working on the formation of 27 other sector security classes one for each of the following 

Security classes for each of these sectors once formed are then grouped to comprise a macroeconomic security class. As with the formation of sector security classes the company would expect that certain sector security classes would require longer periods of time to form that others. In order to ensure that laggard sectors do not hinder the method a macroeconomic security class is flexibly defined as comprising any 14 of these 28 sectors. It is believed that any 14 of these 28 sectors would provide a significant measure of diversification and broad macroeconomic exposure.

Let us suppose that on Feb. 1 2000 the company needed the formation of one more sector security class in order to form a macroeconomic security class. The following thirteen security classes let us suppose were already completed 

With the formation of the Retail Trade sector security class on Feb. 1 a complete macroeconomic security class is formed. All transactions that comprise this massive security class are set aside until about six months have passed. Upon policy expiration the three processes of loss compensation commence in order from specific on the subsector level to general on the macroeconomic or global levels .

It should be noted that a fourth round of loss compensation on the basis of world stocks providing exposure to the global economy is possible. Such a round of loss compensation becomes all the more viable when the invention is extended internationally.

Let us suppose each sector security class represents 1 million in revenue. If this is true a macroeconomic security class which is again comprised of 14 sector security classes represents 14 million in generated revenue. Not all of this 14 million however is intended for loss compensation on the macroeconomic level. Sixty percent of this sum about 8 400 000 is reserved for this final round of loss compensation.

To follow this process we return again to the Feb. 1 purchase of insurance covering 3 000 shares of Winn Dixie Stores with a transaction value of 58 500 19.50 per share . Six months later on Aug. 1 2000 when the term expires Winn Dixie shares traded at 14.50 per share a decline of about 25.64 percent. The client thus sustained a paper loss of 15 000.

Loss compensation within the subsector. Twenty percent of the premiums generated by the Food and Beverage Stores subsector are funneled toward the establishment of a loss compensation fund for grocer subsector participants only. The Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class generated 167 000 in revenue 20 percent of this sum is 33 400.

At the end of the six month period on Aug. 1 2000 the securities within the Food and Beverage Stores subsector for which policies were underwritten stood as follows 

The Food and Beverage Stores subsector has a total number of 279 062.50 sustained loss dollars that are desirous of compensation. A total of 33 400 however is available for this first round of compensation. It is thus necessary for the system to deploy the loss threshold mechanism in marking as unqualified certain loss dollars according to previously agreed upon contract terms.

Prevention of drains on the system. In this example it is clear that the clients who purchased shares in the Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Company would represent a significant drag on the effectiveness of the system if their losses were not in some fashion stemmed. Indeed a company practicing the invention does not want the purchase of equity insurance to entail a cessation of investor monitoring of the investment or decision never to sell the security. As a result this example makes clear that it is necessary that the company place at least a 20 percent cap on the amount of loss that a client can sustain out of fairness to all other system participants who also do not want drains on the system. Taking this 20 percent cap into consideration the Food and Beverage Stores subsector then has a total of 142 200 sustained loss dollars that are desirous of compensation.

How should the company distribute the sum of 33 400 for this first round of loss compensation It is first important to compile a summary of those clients who are desirous of loss compensation 

The next step is to place in order from greatest percentage loss to least these four investments sustaining loss 

Hence the loss threshold percentage for this first phase of loss compensation is 14.44 percent meaning that all losses sustained by Food and Beverage Stores subsector participants are confined to 14.44 percent.

First round distribution. A loss threshold percentage of 14.4444906445 equates to a 5.555093555 percent slice of loss compensation for both GAP and WIN clients.

The functioning of the optimal pricing system. Note here that GAP and WIN shareholders have been allotted respectively 28 761.50 and 4 638.50 loss compensation dollars. If we were to compensate on the basis of actual loss dollars and not optimal dollars GAP shareholders would receive 28 664.28 a lesser figure because we have computed one GAP transaction as occurring at the price of 27.25 when indeed it was transacted at the price of 27.00. Similarly WIN shareholders would receive 4 409.36 a lesser figure because we have computed one of the WIN transactions as occurring at 20.875 when indeed it was transacted at the price of 19.50.

Nevertheless it is important to apply the optimal price for these transactions so that clients as previously discussed have the incentive to purchase into security classes that are formed on running bases even those whose participants may already have paper losses. The optimal price mechanism also provides a significant incentive for clients to purchase equity insurance when the markets are on the rise for this method is capable not only of compensating loss but also providing profit depending on whether there is a difference between a given client s actual entry point and his or her designated optimal price .

Although the order of client compensation is insignificant let us say here that the clients who transacted at optimal prices are first compensated. The GAP client who transacted for GAP shares at 27.25 and who sustained 65 400 in actual loss dollars is compensated 18 165.16. The other GAP client who purchased GAP shares at the non optimal price of 27.00 per share is also compensated at the optimal price receiving 10 596.34. These figures indeed total 28 761.50.

Meanwhile the WIN client who transacted for WIN shares at 20.875 is compensated 1 159.63. The other WIN client who purchased WIN shares at the non optimal price of 19.50 per share is also compensated at the optimal price receiving 3 478.88. These figures total 4 638.51 one cent greater than 4 638.50 due to rounding.

It should be noted here that the optimal price mechanism docs not present inequity to any client. Although it may not appear equitable to allow a client to receive loss compensation on the basis of an optimal transaction value this method compensates those who enter a security class at a time when other system participants are saddled with losses on the same security. The optimal price mechanism allows for the running basis formation of security classes without the disincentive of other system participants with losses. Thus in practice this method is an equitable value proposition when executed on system wide and consistent bases.

Computing loss compensation on an optimal basis. The method of loss compensation proceeds on an optimal basis by first computing the transaction value as occurring at the optimal price for all system participants. The method then multiplies this number by 0.2 providing the figure that represents the amount of insurable loss. This figure was then multiplied by 0.27775467775 which was the quotient of 0.05555093555 the loss compensation percentage and 0.20. The result of this is the amount of loss compensation on an optimal basis.

At the end of the first phase of loss compensation GAP and WIN shareholders had their losses reduced to 14.44 percent while the losses of MARSA and WFMI shareholders remained at respectively 1.6 percent and 5.41 percent.

As with the first phase of loss compensation the second round which is on the more encompassing level of sector distributes a sum that is equal to 20 percent of the revenues generated by the Food and Beverage Stores subsector. Significantly however each subsector that comprises the sector security class puts forward 20 percent of revenues. Because each retail subsector generates a total of 167 000 and a retail sector security class comprises six subsectors the total amount of loss compensation available for this phase is 200 400 33 400 6 .

The amount of loss compensation for the Food and Beverage Stores subsector at this level depends of course on how well the other five subsectors of the Retail Trade sector security class performed.

Let us suppose that after the six month expiration of coverage and its first round of loss compensation the Retail Trade sector security class that which includes the above Food and Beverage Stores subsector security class stood as follows 

In order to compute loss compensation on the basis of sector performance i.e. the second round of loss compensation it is necessary first to compile the results of first round loss compensation that occurred on a subsector basis.

In order to compute loss compensation on the basis of macroeconomic performance i.e. the third round of loss compensation it is necessary first to compile the results of second round loss compensation that occurred on a sector basis.

The final round of loss compensation is intended to expose policyholders to the macroeconomy. The percentage of revenue that is allotted to this realm suggests the degree of significance given to the diversification that this realm provides. In this way one could say that equity insurance represents commodified diversification but without the low growth prospects of mutual funds.

To begin this round it is first necessary to add up the number of Retail Trade loss dollars that remain desirous of compensation. Adding up the figures that are present in the summary above indicates that at this stage a total of 2 503 390.32 dollars remain desirous of compensation. The loss compensation fund is established at 8 400 000 for this round a figure that equals 60 percent of revenues from each of 14 sector security classes.

To begin the system must calculate an average Retail Trade sector percentage loss figure. Based on the figures above the average Retail Trade sector percentage loss excluding gains and equating each percentage loss as equal to each other was 11.66 percent 186.5 16 .

Utilizing sector mutual funds one can ascertain general sector performance for a given period of time. Although these indicators are flawed for this purpose due to their inclusion of gains in the calculation of percentage of depreciation they are nevertheless useful toward providing a general idea as to a sector s performance during a given period of time. These mutual funds are utilized for the sake of this embodiment and would likely not be employed in practice.

The following are the suggested sector performances according to mutual fund performances for the period Feb. 1 2000 to Aug. 1 2000 including the retail sector for comparison purposes 

The process of loss compensation can proceed by compiling a list of those depreciated sectors in order from greatest decline to least. Keep in mind that that these figures would in practice reflect the first two rounds of loss compensation.

If the retail sector has an average loss of 11.66 percent and as previously noted a total of 2 503 390.32 dollars remain desirous of compensation then one can begin to calculate general figures for the number of loss dollars seeking compensation that comprise the depreciated sectors of Information Mining Finance and Insurance Arts Entertainment Recreation and Utilities. The depreciated securities within appreciated sectors were most likely compensated during the first and second rounds of loss compensation. 

Let us suppose for example that the Information sector has a total of 3 978 373 loss dollars desirous of compensation. If 11.66 x 2 503 390.32 then x 214 698.99828 or rounded 214 699. So 18.53 multiplied by 214 699 yields approximately 3 978 373. All numbers below are approximate. 

Along these lines the depreciated sectors contain the following estimated numbers of loss dollars that are desirous of compensation with the third round of loss compensation then proceeding 

This final loss threshold percentage means that all losses save 2.50 percent of each receive compensation.

The 15 000 optimal loss sustained on 3 000 shares of Winn Dixie Stores receives in loss compensation approximately 12 212. With insurable loss capped at 12 525 20 percent utilizing an optimal transaction value of 62 625 the compensation of approximately 12 212 reflects 97.50 percent coverage of optimal and capped loss.

Let us assume that the client sold the WIN shares upon sustaining a 20 percent loss in actual dollars. This would mean that the client disposed of the actual 58 500 transaction upon losing 11 700 in actual dollars excluding commissions. The compensation of 12 212 optimal becomes actual means that the client received more than 100 percent compensation of losses indeed profiting 512 excluding commissions.

Because of this profit this system may be capable of competing with or supplementing the strategy of writing covered calls.

One concern about this method pertained to the challenge of securing clients for those security classes that are unrelated to high technology and biotechnology. A company practicing the invention probably would not want to underwrite policies only for small and mid capitalization companies that are perceived as higher risk investments. This method therefore has a built in flexibility in its ability to define security classes loosely without compromising the principle of diversification definitions which themselves are flexible and subject to change depending on company projections. The system for example could operate by defining a sector security class as one that generates only 1 000 in revenue and thereby allow for considerable personalization of client monitoring .

Significantly however it is important that a company practicing the invention ensures that investors in lower risk securities have the incentive to participant in this system. Indeed their investments in many ways serve as antidotes to the higher risk investments for which the company likely would receive a sufficient number of orders. The challenge then is to make the system equitable and attractive to all investors. Toward this end the company may provide either lower premiums for lower risk investments or create an automatic loss threshold device whose application correlates with a given security s sector and that sector s perceived risk level. Using such company and equity specific information as revenue cash balance profit forecast P E ratio and beta this correlation may vary according to individual security and not just sector risk. Premiums can also be lowered or increased based on other external factors. For example some investment instrument holders may want a larger position insured thus increasing the premiums as the overall portfolio protected may be less diversified. Premiums paid out by instrument holders can also be reduced by an offset value generated by the interest payments on long term bonds purchased using upfront or periodic premiums paid by the interest instrument holders. For example long term governmental bonds or municipal bonds. Let us suppose for now that this device operates on a sector basis. It would function in this case by stipulating that those clients who insure securities in high risk sectors must sustain upfront say a 5 percent loss. In contrast an investor who seeks insurance for a security with low volatility generally a lower risk security may sustain no upfront loss.

Let us say for example that clients who insure their Finance and Insurance stocks generally a less volatile less risky sector begin to express frustration that our technology invested clients routinely secure most of a given system s loss compensation. These Finance and Insurance investors in frustration decide to cease insuring their investments arguing that a 5 percent loss for them is akin to a 15 percent loss for a technology investor. In other words a client oriented toward higher risk investments is often conditioned to greater losses than is a client in lower risk investments. A company practicing the invention therefore might institute a system with the aforementioned automatic and upfront loss threshold device that works to equitably level the conditioned responses to loss.

This device could make more equitable the above system and thereby help to ensure participation from a broad variety of investors.

As another product category it should be noted that a company practicing the invention can also establish private security classes on the basis of individual equity subsector and or sector. Some clients in Finance and Insurance stocks may not want any exposure to the technology sector for example. As a result the company could create security classes that are comprised solely of Finance and Insurance stocks. Loss compensation would then focus exclusively on compensating those clients who had underperforming investments within the Finance and Insurance sector.

This value proposition may appeal significantly to clients in lower risk investments while providing another option for investors who appreciate the diversification of sector or subsector specific mutual funds but also desire the possibility of higher rates of growth.

To accommodate higher risk investors the company could also create technology specific or even for example semiconductor specific security classes. If all participants are losing 50 percent of their investments the loss threshold percentage would be rather high although it certainly would provide some measure of compensation for those clients whose investments significantly underperform their peers. Ultimately the exact methods and products offered depend considerably on market research.

In this embodiment the invention provides a system and method for the brokering of deals between clients that aims to reduce or eliminate through risk capital allocation a given client s residue loss that portion of loss not compensated by the previous processes of loss compensation. This is illustrated in . This option is available to clients whose loss resides below the forward oriented loss threshold percentage and or above the reverse oriented loss threshold percentage.

Like equity insurance this option provides to clients the ability to purchase diversification without the prospect of low growth rates i.e. those of mutual funds . It also allows clients the opportunity to eliminate the entire portion of one s sustained loss. It is in essence a miniature form of venture capital VC or risk capital allocation made especially for retail and institutional loss compensation. The principal differences are that equity need not and perhaps should not exchange hands and that business plans are not involved i.e. there is no venture other than our own a purchase in the stake of the prospect of another client s equity holding or portfolio is essentially a stake in that client s future profits.

The notion then is that a client perhaps one with profit offers to help a client with loss you help me this year and I will try to compensate you next year for more than you gave me this year. To compensate the individual who puts forward loss compensation he or she receives in return a stake in the losing client s future profits a stake sufficient to warrant the initial loss compensation. For individual investors this system makes possible for the first time VC like returns and VC like excitement. What is identified in the art as the risk capital market becomes open for the first time to individual investors who are not professional venture capitalists.

Suppose a client purchased General Motors stock on Nov. 1 2000 along with forward oriented equity insurance and held onto the stock through Mar. 30 2001 the given policy s coverage period or term . At the end of this six month period this client sustained a loss on investment of 15.519 percent. The loss threshold percentage for this client s security class was unfortunately high at 15.529 percent due to the general market decline that occurred during this period. This client was therefore unable to receive loss compensation from the previous process of loss compensation. This example does not reflect the three processes of loss compensation that would normally occur. 

The goal of this embodiment of the invention is as previously noted to reduce or eliminate this client s sustained loss of 15.519 percent. Significantly however this method also aims to provide profit sustaining clients and any other individual including those with losses or company outsiders with the ability to purchase stakes in the future prospects of client equities portfolios trading strategies futures options real estate etc. and potentially receive VC like returns. On the one hand clients could perceive a stake in the future prospect of a conservative portfolio as a low cost means of acquiring diversification but without the prospect of the low growth rates of mutual funds i.e. VC like returns are involved . On the other hand a client may seek a means to purchase for little cost a stake in a high risk equity and have the opportunity to partake in the significant returns of this equity should they materialize.

The core philosophy involved here then is the redistribution of profit for those with loss a redistribution that stands to mutually benefit both sides of each transaction. It is indeed the philosophy of insurance to provide an opportunity to share the costs of possible economic loss to utilize the words of Terry Lowe in his book The Business of Insurance A Comprehensive Introduction to Insurance I .

This method also relies on the notion that a significant number of individuals would prefer if given the choice that their net worth remain stagnant or increase but not decrease. Most people find wrenching the experience of losing their hard earned money i.e. seeing an investment decline . This particular embodiment relies upon the notion that many individuals are willing to part with a portion of future profits in exchange for a reduction or elimination of the present and perhaps painful loss. In this fashion a company practicing the invention can conditionally guarantee that through participation a client s net equity would never decrease only remain stagnant or increase.

A client with loss CWL decides that he or she seeks compensation for his or her loss. Our company asks that the CWL provide certain pieces of information some of which our company may generate and others which the client may provide. Examples of such information may include the number of years of the client s investing experience and basic information about how the client acquired the loss was the investment decision poor or did the company announce unexpected news Certainly if the client wishes he or she need not provide any of this information.

The most important part of this method rests in the notion that the CWL makes public his or her desire for loss compensation and specifies the exact amount of desired loss compensation. A company practicing the invention then will perform one of two processes organize a syndicate of individuals who are willing to compensate this individual for his or her loss or work to identify a single client who is willing to provide loss compensation. In both cases the CWL will specify what he or she offers in return for loss compensation. In one embodiment the CWL will offer a stake in future profits that is sufficient to compensate for the risk that the CWL will not achieve future profits. This agreement will be limited in scope both by time and the amount of future profits that the risk capitalist can retain.

For example let us suppose the GM client mentioned above decides that she would like loss compensation for her 15.519 percent loss. Let us suppose this loss stood at 2 000. Due to the sum involved a company practicing the invention would most likely facilitate the formation of a syndicate. Let us suppose the company finds members to belong to this syndicate each providing 100 to compensate this client.

In exchange for this compensation i.e. to encourage the formation of a syndicate the GM client offers a 100 percent return on the 100 investments should the client achieve sufficient profits within the next year she notes to prospective members of the syndicate her low risk portfolio valued at 100 000 and perhaps promises not to substantially alter this portfolio during the next year. She also notes that her portfolio need only appreciate 4 percent before she can compensate risk capitalists. In essence this client with loss provides members of the syndicate with an excellent opportunity to receive exposure to certain investment instruments allows for VC like returns and furnishes diversification if indeed the GM client s portfolio is invested in instruments in which members of the syndicate seek diversifying exposure.

The number of possible arrangements between clients is innumerable. For example one client in exchange for loss compensation may offer a stake in future profits sustained in futures trading. The CWL registers the commodities and trading activities the risk capitalist can check in on the CWL to monitor but not necessarily impact these trades like looking through a glass window.

In another arrangement a CWL could agree to short a given stock investors who are adverse to shorting a stock him or herself may like exposure to such action through an arrangement such as this. An expert in shorting should indicate and validate this expertise in seeking loss compensation.

As another example a CWL could offer to provide all dividends to a risk capitalist for a given period of time five years for example in exchange for loss compensation.

Or a CWL could explicate his or her trading strategy. Let us say a client employs the Dogs of the Dow strategy. A risk capitalist may provide loss compensation to this individual in exchange for receiving exposure to the Dogs of the Dow strategy.

Essentially all investing strategies portfolio combinations investment instruments and trading activities can become commodified in a way that allow for thorough diversification and significant profit potential.

Let us say a client wanted to devote 10 000 5 percent of his or her portfolio to this method of VC like risk capital investment loss compensation. With 10 000 let us say that this client can serve as risk capitalist to 100 different individuals. By receiving exposure to the potential future profits of more than 100 individuals this risk capitalist provides him or herself with an ample amount diversified exposure to different trading strategies and investment instruments to which the investor perhaps thought he or she could never receive exposure.

Let us say that some of these 100 individuals end up generating significant profits. By the end of the year this 10 000 could be as much as 25 000 or more depending on those arrangements into which the client entered. Although the risk capitalist s investments could also be less than 10 000 a company practicing the invention may offer to insure the system s risk capitalists representing another business opportunity.

One should note that this method can be conducted on a very small or large scale with syndicates of 1 000 people each agreeing to pay either 2 or 2 000 for example.

In conclusion those with profit or other individuals redistribute their profit or risk capital with the objective of securing additional profit or capital doing so in a highly diversified fashion. Although the risk capitalist takes the chance that he or she will not receive a return on investment a company practicing the invention may insure this risk.

Referring to an example of a profit redistribution embodiment is illustrated. In this embodiment a level of profit redistribution to all participants is provided with gains distributed until all system losses are reduced to a previously determined percentage or eliminated. For example with 10 participants in a system four with losses totaling 100 000 each has 25 000 loss and six with gains totaling 300 000 each has 50 000 profit . If profit redistribution is the only form of loss compensation each of the six participants with gains will have their profits reduced by 16 666 or 33.3 percent. The result would be that the net worth of all system participants either remained stagnant or increased.

Another example entails varying levels of profit and loss. A profit redistribution threshold operates in the same fashion as the backend loss compensation threshold the difference is that the mechanism would treat profit percentages rather than loss percentages. In other words this embodiment can guarantee through the backend loss threshold mechanism that losses would be limited to a given percentage that of the loss threshold . Through this profit redistribution threshold mechanism the invention limits profit percentages in exchange for the added assurance that additional loss compensation is available.

In another embodiment the method limits profit redistribution to profits beyond a certain percentage or threshold. This percentage is set at a level that will not dissuade a large number of investors from purchasing into the system for example gains beyond 50 percent are subject to profit redistribution but gains less than 45 percent are not subject to profit redistribution.

Although illustrative embodiments have been described herein in detail it should be noted and will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations may be made within the scope of this invention without departing from the principle of this invention and without sacrificing its chief advantages. Such variations include premium distribution.

In this variation premiums are divided among different loss compensation techniques. A standard premium is divided in half for example with one half applied to frontend loss compensation and the other half applied to backend loss compensation. Premiums can also be applied at periodic increments or as a pay as you go.

In another variation premiums are differentially divided. For example 80 percent of the premium applied to frontend loss compensation and 20 percent of the premium applied to backend loss compensation. In this variation the investor if favored in the distribution of frontend compensation but less favored on the backend compensation.

In another variation there is a roll over operation between loss reduction funds. For example in a rising market some funds from some loss reduction funds may not be needed and can be rolled over to a future loss reduction fund.

In another variation the investor determines the threshold rather than selecting a premium. In this variation the investor can indicate a high or low tolerance for loss. For example one investor indicates that they are willing to absorb a higher level of loss with an associated reduced premium and another investor indicates that they are willing to pay more premium with a lower level of loss.

Unless otherwise specifically stated the terms and expressions have been used herein as terms of description and not terms of limitation. There is no intention to use the terms or expressions to exclude any equivalents of features shown and described or portions thereof and this invention should be defined in accordance with the claims that follow.
