This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 558 860 entitled DESIGN OF GLOBAL CODEBOOK FOR LONG TERM EVOLUTION ADVANCED COORDINATED MULTI POINT PROCESSING filed Nov. 11 2011 the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to communication networks and more particularly to wireless communication networks.

Wireless communications systems are used in a variety of telecommunications systems television radio and other media systems data communication networks and other systems to convey information between remote points using wireless transmitters and wireless receivers. A transmitter is an electronic device which usually with the aid of an antenna propagates an electromagnetic signal modulated with information such as radio television or other telecommunications. A receiver is an electronic device which receives and a wireless electromagnetic signal and processes the information modulated thereon. A transmitter and receiver may be combined into a single device called a transceiver.

Long Term Evolution Advanced LTE A is a popular standard for fourth generation 4G wireless technology. The current version of the LTE A standard is Release 11 Rel. 11 and a particular feature of Rel. 11 is Multiple input multiple output MIMO transmission where multiple antennas are used for transmitting and receiving wireless signals transmitted in streams of bits known as symbols. Coordinated Multi point Processing CoMP may be used to coordinate and combine the transmission of signals used in MIMO transmission. Down link DL CoMP is a type of MIMO transmission in which a plurality of transmission sites e.g. base stations remote radio heads RRHs etc. work together to jointly transmit wireless signals to one or more receive antennas located on a user terminal. Determining efficient signal transmission among the multiple transmission sites to an endpoint may improve the communication of information via a wireless system.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure a method for generating a codebook comprises generating a plurality of wireless communication channel representations. The method further comprises generating a precoding matrix for each of the plurality of wireless communication channel representations. The method additionally comprises performing a clustering operation on the precoding matrices to determine a plurality of centroids associated with the precoding matrices. Also the method includes determining codewords based on the centroids and generating a codebook based on the codewords.

Embodiments and their advantages may be understood by referring to of the drawings like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.

As detailed below system may allow for Multiple input multiple output MIMO transmission where multiple antennas are used for transmitting and receiving wireless signals. Additionally system may be configured to perform Coordinated Multi point Processing CoMP to coordinate and combine the transmission of signals used in MIMO transmission. The CoMP processing may perform down link DL CoMP transmission in which multiple transmission sites jointly communicate with endpoint . The joint DL transmission may be facilitated through the use of a codebook. In accordance with the present disclosure a global codebook may be generated by using a data mining and clustering scheme. Such a scheme may allow for the selection of codewords for the codebook to improve joint DL transmission from transmission sites to an endpoint as described in detail below with respect to .

As used herein transmission site may refer to a base station also known as a Radio Element Control Evolved Node B s eNBs or a Baseband Unit or a remote transmission site also known as a Radio Element or a Remote Radio Head RRH . For example transmission sites may each be base stations. As another example transmission site may be a base station and transmission sites and may be remote transmission sites. In certain situations a transmission site that is a remote transmission site may function as an extension of a transmission site that is a base station. For example the remote transmission site may send wireless signals to endpoint that are similar to wireless signals that would be sent by the base station to the endpoint if endpoint were located close to the base station.

Transmission site may include any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for wired or wireless exchange of information in antenna system . Transmission sites may be operable to send control signals and data traffic to endpoints . A transmission site may also be coupled to other transmission sites via one or more wired connections. These wired connections may comprise any suitable material such as optical fiber. Transmission sites may use any suitable technologies or protocols e.g. Common Public Radio Interface CPRI to communicate with each other.

Transmission sites may communicate with endpoint using wireless communication via one or more antenna ports . For example transmission site may communicate with endpoint via antenna ports and . Transmission sites may communicate with endpoint using any of a variety of different wireless technologies including but not limited to orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA and the long term evolution advanced LTE A protocol as defined in the 3GPP Release 11 or beyond. In some embodiments of the present disclosure a transmission site may coordinate with one more other transmission sites to jointly communicate with endpoint . In such embodiments transmission sites may coordinate with each other to communicate with endpoint using a MIMO transmission scheme where multiple transmitting antenna ports are placed at different transmission sites while one or more receiving antenna ports are located at the endpoint .

For example transmission sites and may communicate with endpoint using a DL CoMP MIMO transmission as defined in 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Release 11 or beyond. During such a MIMO transmission transmission site may wirelessly communicate a portion of a data stream through antenna ports and and communicate another portion of the data stream through a wired connection to transmission site . Transmission site may then send at least a portion of the data stream to endpoint via one or more wireless connections between antenna ports and and one or more antenna ports of endpoint . Endpoint may then combine the multiple signals received from transmission sites and into a single communication.

Although not shown in the embodiment depicted transmission sites may also be coupled to any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals data and or messages including signals data or messages transmitted through WebPages e mail text chat voice over IP VoIP and instant messaging in order to provide services and data to endpoints . For example transmission site may be coupled to one or more LANs WANs MANs PSTNs WiMAX networks global distributed networks such as the Internet or any other form of wireless or wired networking. In particular embodiments transmission site also communicates with a base station controller that facilitates handoffs between cells and provides other functions.

Endpoint may comprise any type of wireless device able to send and receive data and or signals to and from transmission site directly and or via one or more other transmission sites . Some examples of endpoints include desktop computers PDAs cell phones laptops and or VoIP phones. Endpoints may provide data or network services to a user through any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . Endpoints may also include unattended or automated systems gateways other intermediate components or other devices that may send or receive data and or signals.

Various types of information may be sent to or from endpoint . As an example a transmission site may send data traffic and control traffic to endpoint . Data traffic may be distinguished from control traffic that is used to setup and maintain a connection between one or more transmission sites and endpoint . For example and not by way of limitation data traffic may include information that transmission site receives from a network coupled to the transmission site such as the Internet or from another endpoint located in the same cell or a different cell. In a particular embodiment data traffic is sent to endpoint via a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH as defined in the LTE A protocol. In such embodiments demodulation reference signals DM RS as defined in the LTE A protocol may be sent from the physical antenna ports of the transmission sites and used to extract the relevant data traffic from the PDSCH.

Transmission sites may also send control traffic to endpoint . In particular embodiments these control messages are transmitted by a single transmission site or jointly by multiple transmission sites . The control messages may include information e.g. scheduling or demodulation information that allows endpoint to extract relevant data traffic from transmissions sent from the transmission sites . In particular embodiments these control messages conform to the LTE A standard. For example the control messages may include cell specific reference signals CRS such as primary synchronization signal PSS secondary synchronization signal SSS physical broadcast channel PBCH and or physical downlink control channel PDCCH reference signals.

In particular embodiments transmission sites transmit control signals known as a channel reference signals . A channel reference signal may include a sequence of values such as a pseudo random sequence. As an example a channel reference signal may be a channel state information reference signal CSI RS as defined in LTE A. In particular embodiments each antenna port of a particular transmission site transmits the same channel reference signal e.g. a signal with the same sequence . The antenna ports of each transmission site may transmit one or more channel reference signals that are distinguishable from the channel reference signals transmitted by the antenna ports of each other transmission site . As an example the channel reference signal transmitted by transmission site may be orthogonal in time frequency or code OCC domain or any combination thereof to the channel reference signals and transmitted by transmission sites and respectively. Accordingly endpoint may be able to determine which transmission site is transmitting a particular channel reference signal .

Endpoint may analyze a received channel reference signal to determine one or more characteristics of the channel H between the transmission site that sent the channel reference signal and the endpoint . For example endpoint may calculate a frequency response of a channel based on a received channel reference signal this may be referred to as estimating the channel . When wireless signals are sent from transmission site to endpoint they may take many directions resulting in multipath fading and may be reflected e.g. by buildings or cars or obstructed by objects such as trees. A channel is a composite representation of the various paths and associated path loss that wireless signals sent from transmission site to endpoint may take.

Due to the differences in paths between transmission sites and endpoint the channels from different transmission sites to endpoint e.g. channels also represented by channel coefficient H and also represented by channel coefficient H may be uncorrelated with respect to amplitude and phase resulting in different path loss between the channels. In contrast the elements of a channel matrix i.e. the constituent parts of the channel that each correspond to a single antenna port of the same transmission site and a single antenna port of endpoint between a transmission site and an endpoint are usually correlated with respect to amplitude and phase due to similarities in their paths to endpoint .

During joint downlink communication e.g. DL CoMP transmission between endpoint and a plurality of transmission sites the overall transmission path between endpoint and the plurality of transmission sites may be referred to as a composite channel that includes the respective channels . For example during joint communication between endpoint and transmission sites and a composite channel H may include channel H and channel H and may be expressed as H HH . Accordingly during joint communication a composite channel including uncorrelated channels e.g. composite channel H comprising Hand H may be analyzed estimated .

To improve the transmission over a channel e.g. to help compensate for path loss or improve the capacity of a channel a transmission site may apply a function known as a precoding matrix W to data sent from the transmission site to endpoint . The application of the precoding matrix to data transmitted from a transmission site may be analogous to changing the channel characteristics.

A precoding matrix for a particular channel may be determined by taking the right singular vector rsv of the channel as indicated by the channel coefficient which may be determined by taking the singular value decomposition of the channel as indicated by the channel coefficient . For example an ideal precoding matrix W for channel H may be determined by taking the right singular vector of channel H and may be expressed as the following function 

A composite precoding matrix may also be determined for a composite channel including a plurality of uncorrelated channels. For example a composite precoding matrix W for a composite channel H comprising channels H and H may be determined by taking the right singular value of H as expressed by the following function 

Composite precoding matrix W may include two parts Wand W that each correspond with channels H and H respectively. Accordingly composite precoding matrix W may be expressed as

When a channel has been analyzed by endpoint e.g. estimated endpoint may determine a precoding matrix W for the channel . For example endpoint may estimate channel H from transmission site and may determine a precoding matrix W for channel . In accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure during a joint downlink communication endpoint may analyze a composite channel that includes uncorrelated channels Endpoint may then determine a precoding matrix for the composite channel that includes precoding matrices associated with each channel. For example for a composite channel H that includes channel H and channel H endpoint may determine a composite precoding matrix W that includes the elements of a precoding matrix W associated with channel H and elements of a precoding matrix W associated with channel H as described above. In particular embodiments the composite precoding matrix for the composite channel may be selected as a codeword from a predefined codebook CBK generated in accordance with the present disclosure as detailed below with respect to .

Upon determining an applicable precoding matrix endpoint may communicate the determined precoding matrix to the transmitting transmission site s . In some embodiments transmission sites may include the predefined codebook such that endpoint may transmit an indicator of which codeword i.e. precoding matrix included in the codebook to use to the applicable transmission site . In some embodiments endpoint may transmit the indicator on the overhead of a feedback channel between endpoint and the applicable transmission site . The precoding matrix may help compensate for path loss and or other channel effects. Therefore a transmission site may apply the precoding matrix indicated by the endpoint to improve communications over the associated channel between the transmission site and endpoint .

As used herein an effective channel may be defined as the frequency response of data that is precoded i.e. a precoding matrix is applied to the data and then sent across a channel to the endpoint . Thus the effective channel is the product in the frequency domain of the corresponding channel H and the precoding matrix W applied to data sent through the corresponding channel .

According to some embodiments of the present disclosure during a joint DL transmission endpoint may determine a composite precoding matrix W associated with a composite channel H as described above and may communicate the composite precoding matrix W to the applicable transmission sites . The transmission sites may then determine which elements of the composite precoding matrix to apply to the corresponding channel .

For example endpoint may communicate a composite precoding matrix W that includes the elements of a precoding matrix W associated with channel H and elements of a precoding matrix W associated with channel H to transmission sites and jointly performing a DL transmission with endpoint . Transmission site may apply the elements of precoding matrix W included in the composite precoding matrix W to channel H . Additionally transmission site may apply the elements of precoding matrix W included in the composite precoding matrix W to channel H . In some embodiments transmission sites and may include a codebook that includes a plurality of composite precoding matrices W and may select the applicable precoding matrix based on indicators communicated by endpoint . As mentioned above the codebook that includes composite precoding matrices for joint DL transmission may be generated in accordance to embodiments of the present disclosure as detailed below. Therefore transmission sites and may apply a desired precoding matrix Wand W respectively to improve communications via channels H and H respectively.

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example antenna network may be configured to support any number of endpoints . Additionally in some instances joint DL transmission may be performed with more than two transmission sites . Further the number of antenna ports associated with transmission sites may vary depending on particular networks.

Accordingly the above mentioned components of transmission sites and endpoint may enable transmission sites and endpoint to perform operations such as joint DL transmission according to the present disclosure. Additionally such components may allow for the use of a codebook generated in accordance with the present disclosure to help facilitate the joint DL transmission.

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example any of the options or features described herein may be utilized in combination with the illustrated embodiments of FIGURE and and or any number of the other options or features also described herein as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

As described in detail below a codebook for joint DL transmissions between a plurality of transmission sites e.g. transmission sites and of and an endpoint e.g. endpoint of may be generated using a data mining and clustering scheme. Such a codebook may be used for a large distribution of channels H from a transmission site to an endpoint where the respective channels between different transmission sites to the endpoint may have a wide range of power imbalances between them. Additionally generating a codebook using clustering may reduce and or minimize the expected chordal distance between an optimal precoding matrix for any given composite channel and the precoding matrices that are included in the codebook.

Method may start and at step a large set HS of channel realizations between a transmission site and an endpoint may be generated. Each channel realization may be generated to represent different effects e.g. pathloss that may be experienced by wireless signals based on varying differences between transmission paths between the transmission site and the endpoint. The channel realizations may be determined based on any suitable channel distribution model. For example a MIMO channel from a transmission site to an endpoint may follow a distribution based on a Spatial Channel Model Extended SCME distribution such that the set of channel realizations may be generated based on the SCME distribution.

The channel distribution may be based on a variety of factors including the number of antennas at a transmission site and the number of antennas at an endpoint. Therefore the specific configuration of and number of different channel realization sets HS may vary depending on the transmission sites and endpoints for which a codebook may be generated. For example if all the transmission sites have the same number of antennas and the endpoints also have the same number of antennas one channel realization set may be generated. In contrast if some transmission sites have different numbers of antennas and some endpoints also have different numbers of antennas different channel realization sets may be generated to account for all the different permutations.

At step a power distribution imbalance for the network simulated at step may be generated. As mentioned above the path from an endpoint to different transmission sites may vary because of the differences in the transmission paths. Accordingly the different channels may have power differences and the relationship may be expressed mathematically. As an example the distribution of power difference between channels H and H may be expressed as the following function H H where represents the power difference. The power difference between channels may follow a cumulative distribution function a such as that shown in . Therefore in some embodiments power distribution function a such as that shown in may be generated at step .

At step a large number of composite precoding matrices may be generated based on the channel realization set s HS generated at step and the power distribution function generated at step . For example a channel representation H may be randomly selected from an appropriate channel realization set HS to represent a channel between a first transmission site and an endpoint. The channel realization set HS from which Hmay be chosen may be a set that corresponds with the transmission site and the endpoint transmissions. For example if the transmission site has four antenna ports and the endpoint has two antenna ports Hmay be selected from a channel realization set generated for MIMO transmissions where the transmission site has four antenna ports and the endpoint has two antenna ports. Additionally another channel representation H may be randomly selected from an appropriate channel realization set HS to represent a channel between a second transmission site and the endpoint. In some embodiments where the antenna configuration of the two transmission sites is the same e.g. both transmission sites have four antenna ports Hand Hmay be selected from the same channel realization set HS . If the antenna configuration of the two transmission sites is different e.g. the first transmission site has four antenna ports and the second has three antenna ports Hand Hmay be selected from different channel realization sets HS .

Additionally at step a power imbalance a may be randomly selected from a generated at step . The randomly selected power imbalance may be applied to one of Hand Hto model a power imbalance between the channels represented by Hand H. Additionally a phase shift may be applied to one of Hand Hto model phase differences between the channels represented by Hand H. After the phase and power modifications have been made to one of Hand H a composite channel H including both Hand Hmay be generated. A composite precoding matrix W for the composite channel H may be determined by taking the right square value of the composite matrix H as described above. Additionally the size of the composite precoding matrix may be determined and based on the transmission rank that may be used for composite channel H. For example the number of columns of the composite precoding matrix may correspond with the transmission rank e.g. a precoding matrix having four columns may be generated based on a transmission rank of four .

This process may be repeated many times to generate a large sample of composite precoding matrices for a large number of different composite channels to effectively model joint DL transmission between two transmission sites. For example this process may be done over ten thousand times in some embodiments.

The generation of different precoding matrices may be accomplished using any suitable processing system configured to run an algorithm. For example the following algorithm may be run to produce a large number of precoding matrices for joint DL transmission between two transmission sites and an endpoint where the two transmission sites have the same antenna configuration 

Accordingly a large number of composite precoding matrices may be generated at step where at least a subset of the composite precoding matrices may be included in a codebook as detailed with respect to steps and below. Although step is described as generating precoding matrices for joint DL transmission that includes two transmission sites modifications may be made to step to generate composite precoding matrices for DL transmission that includes more than two transmission sites. For example an extra step may be included to randomly choose a third channel realization H from an appropriate channel realization set HS to represent a channel between a third transmission site and the endpoint. Accordingly phase and power adjustments may also be made to the third channel realization H and the composite channel H may include the elements of H also.

At step the number of codewords precoding matrices to be included in the codebook may be chosen such that the size of the codebook may be selected. The number of codewords included in a codebook may be based on a variety of factors including how much information may be transmitted by the feedback overhead in the signals transmitted from the endpoint to the transmission sites indicating which codeword to use. For example if the feedback overhead is only four bits long the size of the codebook may be limited to sixteen codewords. As another example if the size of the feedback overhead is eight bits the size of the codebook may include two hundred fifty six codewords.

At step a clustering algorithm may be performed on the large number of precoding matrices based on the size of the codebook selected at step . For example if the codebook size is sixteen a clustering algorithm may be performed to select sixteen precoding matrices that may collectively approximate the distribution of the large number of precoding matrices generated at step .

In some embodiments the precoding matrices may be selected for the codebook by using a generalized Lloyd s algorithm. Lloyd s algorithm may begin by partitioning the large number of composite precoding matrices determined at step into K initial sets that are randomly selected where K represents the size of the codebook. The average point or centroid of each set of precoding matrices may then be determined. Once the centroid is determined K new partitions may be generated by associating each precoding matrix with the centroid to which it is closest. Then new centroids for the new clusters may be determined. This process may be repeated until there is convergence among the precoding matrices in which the precoding matrices no longer switch clusters after performing the above steps. Therefore the centroids of the last clusters may represent the overall distribution of the large number of precoding matrices. Such a configuration may reduce and or minimize the chordal distance between each of the precoding matrices in the large set of precoding matrices and one of the centroid precoding matrices.

Below is an example application of Lloyd s algorithm that may be used to determine the centroids of a large set of precoding matrices W 

At step the centroids of the last clusters may be selected as the codewords precoding matrices that are to be included in the codebook and the codebook may accordingly be generated. Following step method may end. Therefore a codebook may be generated according to method to select precoding matrices that may reduce and or minimize the chordal distance between an optimal precoding matrix for a particular composite channel and one of the precoding matrices included in the codebook. As such the codebook generated in accordance with the present disclosure may improve the quality of joint DL transmission between a plurality of transmission sites and an endpoint.

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to method without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example the specific order of operations of the steps described above may be different than the order described and some steps may be performed simultaneously. Also method is described with respect to certain situations and algorithms which may be modified according to specific network parameters. Additionally in some embodiments a codebook may be generated for a particular transmission rank and a reduced rank codebook may be generated from the higher ranking codebook. For example to generate a codebook CB having a transmission rank t from a codebook CBhaving a higher transmission rank T the first t columns of each codeword in CBmay be used as the codewords in codebook CB.
