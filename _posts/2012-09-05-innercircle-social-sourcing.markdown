The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 532 387 titled SOCIAL NETWORKING ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTING COLLABORATIVE SOCIAL INTERACTION filed Sep. 8 2011 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

Social networks allow users to create and manage a user profile join user groups and communicate with other users via a computing device such as a personal computer or mobile device. Mobile devices may augment the social networking experience by enabling the mobile device user to share geographic location information with other users of the social network. Mobile devices having an on board camera also enable media content in the form of photographs and videos to be captured and shared with other users. Mobile devices supporting augmented reality present users with information overlaying a camera view of a graphical display captured via an on board camera. These and other features enable further improvement and expansion of the social networking experience for the benefit of its users.

A social networking environment supporting collaborative social interaction is disclosed. In both real world and social networking environments people often desire to meet and establish social connections with other people. The disclosed social networking environment enables a subject user to request and obtain assistance from third party users in the form of commentary and or introductions with respect to a target user. Third party users may be identified and or selected from a first group of users that are defined as the subject user s inner circle of acquaintances while the target user may be identified and or selected from a broader group of users existing outside of the inner circle of acquaintances.

The disclosed social networking environment may be implemented by a computing system having a number of client computing devices each operated by a human user associated with a user identity. A server system may facilitate communications and interactions between the client computing devices via a communications network. Through the assistance of geographic location information shared by users a subject user may observe that a target user is physically nearby. The subject user may request and receive commentary from and or introductions by third party users offering assistance to the subject user in order to facilitate social interactions between the subject user and the target user either physically within the real world or virtually with the social networking environment.

A graphical user interface including a viewer environment may be provided for the presentation of information to users via their respective client computing device. The viewer environment may include user profile information and or icons representing the geographic location of users within a displayed map view or augmented reality view. User input may be obtained from a client computing device received via the viewer environment. User input may include commentary provided by a third party user regarding a target user or communications between one or more of the third party user target user and or subject user in order to facilitate an introduction. The commentary and or communications may be directed to a subject user as either a private semi private or public message.

A social networking environment is disclosed which enables users to 1 request that a third party user provide commentary and or introduction with respect to a target user 2 provide commentary and or introduction to a subject user regarding a target user 3 engage in a game in which users earn points for providing commentary introduction and or successfully matching or assisting to establish relationships between two or more other users 4 view a compatibility value between two or more users in the context of an augmented reality camera view or map view with the assistance of geographic location information shared by the users 5 define a subset of acquaintances within the social networking environment referred to as the user s inner circle of acquaintances that may be relied upon to provide commentary and or introduction for that user with respect to a target user. Such commentary and or introduction may take the form of electronic text or voice communications between users within the social networking environment over a communications network.

The social networking environment may be implemented by a computing system. is a schematic diagram depicting an example computing system according to one embodiment. Computing system may include a server system and any number of client computing devices etc. that may communicate with each other via a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet or portion thereof . Detailed aspects of these client computing devices will be further described with reference to example client computing device . A user may operate a client computing device to interact with other users within the social networking environment. Within the social networking environment a user may be represented by a user identity having an associated user profile.

In at least some implementations client computing device may take the form of a personal computer or a mobile device. Client computing device may include a storage device having a data store and instructions stored thereon.

Client computing device may include a camera for capturing a camera view that may be presented to the user via a graphical user interface GUI of the client computing device and or may be stored as an image or video file in data store . User interface may include any suitable input devices and or output devices to enable a user to interact with or otherwise control the operation of client computing device . As one example user interface may include a touch sensitive graphical display e.g. a touch screen that presents graphical content e.g. a GUI and enables a user to provide a user input via the graphical display. However other suitable input and or output devices may be supported.

Server system may include one or more server devices which may be generally referred to as computing devices. Server system may include a storage device having data store and instructions stored thereon. Server system may include a processor for executing instructions to enable the server system to provide the functionality and or perform the methods described herein. Data store may include user identity and or user profile information for one or more users of the computing system. Server system may associate a particular user and or client computing device operated by the user with a particular user identity via a user authentication e.g. sign in process for example. Each account identity may be associated with user profile information. In at least some implementations server system may obtain user identity and or user profile information from a remote server device hosting the social networking information such as via an application programming interface API or other suitable programming interface for example.

At the method may include obtaining geographic position information and or user profile information associated with each of a plurality of user identities of corresponding users. As one example user profile information may include a user name identifier a photographic image of the corresponding user and or other suitable profile information such as biographical information user preferences etc. The user profile information may be associated with a corresponding account identity enabling users to be identified and distinguished from each other.

The user profile information may also indicate relationship information between users within the social networking environment. The relationship information may be represented for example as links between user identities within a database structure. In at least some implementations the user profile information associated with each user identity may be obtained via an application programming interface API or other suitable programming interface of a social networking service hosted by a server device. The geographic position information associated with each of the plurality of mobile devices may be received from each of the plurality of mobile devices or from an intermediary computing device e.g. server device if respective users of the mobile devices have indicated that the geographic position information of the mobile devices are to be shared with other services. Geographic position information may likewise be obtained via an API or other suitable programming interface of a social networking service hosted by a server device.

At the method may include providing a viewer environment for presentation via a graphical user interface of a computing device. The viewer environment may include the user profile information and or icons representing a geographic position of each of a plurality of mobile devices associated with user identities based on the received geographic position information. As one example the viewer environment may include a map view and or a camera view presented via a mobile device. Icons within the viewer environment may form an augmented reality layer for the map view or camera view for example. Users may physically navigate to other users within the real world environment by referencing the viewer environment for the geographic location of such users.

At the method may include prompting a third party user to provide a user input via the viewer environment. As one example the third party user may be prompted via a message presented via a graphical display of the user s computing device responsive to a request made by a subject user for commentary and or introduction with respect to a target user. As another example the third party user may be prompted responsive to the subject user coming within a threshold geographic proximity to the target user. A prompt may be presented to the third party user that indicates the target user identity and or subject user identity including associated profile information and or geographic location information for the target and or subject users. As yet another example the third party user may define or otherwise select one or more of the target user identity and or subject user identity with or without prompting.

In at least some implementations for each subject user one or more third party users and or one or more target users may be identified by the server system based on relationship status between the subject user third party user and or target user existing within the social networking environment. As one example a first set of users of a social networking environment having a first relationship status type relative to a subject user may be identified. The third party user may be selected from the first set of users. The first set of users may define an inner circle of social acquaintances established by the subject user for example. However other relationships status types may be used to distinguish users. A second set of users of the social networking environment having a second relationship status type relative to the subject user may be identified. The second relationship status type may take the form of users with which the subject user is not acquainted or has not yet established a direct relationship link within the social networking environment.

At the method may include obtaining user input from the third party user via the viewer environment concerning one or more of the target user and or subject user. The user input may include commentary by the third party user regarding the target user. The user input may indicate the subject user identity that is to receive the commentary. The commentary may include communications between the third party user and one or more of the target user and subject user. Such communications may facilitate an introduction of the subject user to the target user or may enable the subject user and or target user to determine whether to communicate with each other.

At the method may include providing commentary and or communications to the mobile device of the subject user as a private semi private or public message. A private message includes communications that may be accessed or read only by the sender and receiver. A semi private message includes communications that may be accessed or read only by a defined group or subset of users including the sender receiver and other designated users. A public message includes communications that may be accessed or read by any user. The message may identify the third party user the target user and or the subject user to enable proper addressing of messages to the appropriate client computing device and to provide an indication to users of the sender and receiver of the message or the subject of commentary or introduction. In at least some implementations providing commentary or other communications to a mobile device of a user for presentation may include posting the commentary or communications to a user profile associated with the user via an API or other suitable programming interface of a social networking service. The user may access the commentary or communications by retrieving or otherwise receiving the commentary or communications from the social networking service at their respective computing device.

In at least some implementations obtaining user input via the viewer environment at may include receiving a first selection at an icon or other suitable selector representing the target user and receiving a second selection at an icon or other suitable selector representing the subject user. One or more of the first selection and or the second selection may be received via a touch sensitive display or other suitable input device. A link may be created between users or associated user identities responsive to a touch gesture dragging at least one of the first icon selector or second icon selector towards the other of the first icon selector and second icon selector. For example the commentary at may include or indicate the link created between the target user and the subject user.

In at least some implementations the method may further include updating a value associated with the third party user responsive to the commentary or communications being provided by that user for example via user input. The value may represent a score or points of a game for example. Users may be encouraged to provide commentary or communications in order to receive points or obtain a better score within the game. In this way third party users may be benefited by engaging in collaborative social interactions with other users.

In at least some implementations the method may further include providing relationship information for at least one pair of users based on a comparison of the user profile information associated with each user. For example the relationship information presented to users via the viewer environment may indicate a compatibility score between any two users based on their respective profile information. For example a subject user may view the compatibility score of other users located within a geographic proximity to the subject user. Alternatively or additionally the relationship information may include the identity of other users through which any two users are connected within the social networking environment. For example a subject user may view third party users that establish a social connection between the subject user and a target user. The third party users presented in this way may be selected by the subject user to provide commentary and or introductions with respect to the target user.

At the method may include obtaining geographic position information and or user profile information associated with each of a plurality of user identities from a social networking service via a wide area network. As one example a client computing device of the third party user may obtain the geographic information and or user profile information from a server system via an API or other suitable programming interface of the social networking service.

At the method may include presenting a viewer environment via a graphical user interface of the client computing device of the third party user. The viewer environment may include the user profile information and or icons representing a geographic position for a number of users based on the received geographic position information.

At the method may include receiving a user input via the viewer environment regarding a target user. The user input may include commentary or other suitable communications regarding the target mobile device user and may indicate a destination mobile device user of the plurality of mobile devices to receive the commentary such as a subject user or the target user for example.

At the method may include sending the commentary or communications to the indicated subject user or target user. The commentary or communications may be transmitted via the social networking service over the wide area network. The social networking service may associate the commentary or communications with the user profile information of the indicated subject user or target user as a private semi private or public message.

In at least some implementations the viewer environment presented via a graphical user interface of a client computing device may include one or more of a map viewing window and or an augmented reality viewing window a plurality of icons representing a geographic position for each of a plurality of mobile devices a user profile information field associated with each of the plurality of icons and or a selector for directing commentary or communications regarding a target user to a subject user.

At the method may include sending geographic position information to a social networking service via a wide area network. As one example the social networking service may be hosted at a server system and may receive the geographic position information via an API or other suitable programming interface. The geographic position information and or user profile information of the subject user may be forwarded to other users by the server system which may utilize the information as previously described with regards to method for example. Additionally the subject user may obtain geographic location information and or user profile information for other users e.g. one or more target users located for example within a particular geographic proximity to the subject user.

At the method may include presenting a viewer environment via a graphical user interface of subject user s mobile device. The viewer environment may indicate a geographic position of one or more of the target user and or third party user the user profile information associated with the target user and or third party user in addition to the commentary or communications provided by the third party user. The commentary or communications may aid the subject user in establishing a relationship or interaction with the target user either in real life or within the social networking environment.

At the method may include sending a request for commentary or other communications to the social networking service via the wide area network. The request for commentary or communications may be initiated by the subject user via the user s client computing device e.g. a mobile device . In at least some implementations the request for commentary may indicate one or more other third party users that are invited to provide commentary or initiate communications and or may indicate one or more target users for which the commentary is requested or to which communications may be directed by the third party user e.g. to initiate introductions . For example a user may utilize manipulation gesturing within an augmented reality or map view of a mobile device to request or provide commentary on another user such as by dragging two user icons together.

The social networking service may forward the request for commentary or communications to one or more third party users which may fulfill the request. The third party users to receive the request may be defined or selected by the subject user or by the social networking service using an automated process. For example requests may be sent to a subset of users having a pre existing relationship with the subject user. As one example the third party users that are sent requests may be defined to include users having a relationship link between e.g. linking the subject user and the target user of a certain type. As previously discussed a third party user may be within the inner circle of the subject user. A third party user may additionally be required to have at least a threshold relationship type established with the target user. For example a third party user may be required to be both within the inner circle of or otherwise be a friend type acquaintance with the subject user and be a friend type acquaintance of the target user. However other suitable filtering criteria may be applied to third party users.

At the method may include in response to the request for commentary or other suitable communications receiving the commentary or communications provided by the third party user. The commentary or communications may be received as a private semi private or public message addressed to the mobile device of the subject user. The commentary or communications may identify the target user which the commentary or communications concerns. Alternatively or additionally commentary or communications provided by the third party user may be directed to the target user for example to facilitate an introduction between the subject user and target user.

In at least some implementations the viewer environment presented via a GUI of the subject user s mobile device may include one or more of a map view window and or a camera view window having an augmented reality layer a selector to enable a user to initiate a request for commentary or communications from a third party user of a remote computing device a plurality of icons representing a geographic position of other users including a target user and or a field to display commentary or communications received from the remote computing device for the target mobile computing device as a private message responsive to the request for commentary.

The GUI of also includes selectors or tools that enable USER  to send or request commentary to from individual users with respect to other users. For example USER  may send commentary to inner circle users e.g. USER  and USER  as a third party user or USER  may request that the inner circle users provide commentary regarding a target user as third party users to USER . As another example USER  may send commentary to other friends e.g. USER  and USER  as a third party user or USER  may request that the other friends provide commentary regarding a target user as third party users to USER . However in some examples only inner circle users may send or request commentary to from USER . Other friends may additionally or alternatively be target users of commentary sent to or requested from inner circle users. As yet another example USER  may serve as a third party user to send commentary to a subject user or may serve as a subject user requesting commentary from a third party user in which other users e.g. USER  and USER  may be the target user.
