This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number 9825 . The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure relates to a switchable RFID card reader antenna and in an embodiment but not by way of limitation a switchable RFID card reader antenna that includes a plurality of loops and a plurality of double pole double throw switches.

A contactless smartcard when held in the vicinity of a reader and reader coil completes a transformer circuit which allows a two way communication to take place between the card and the reader. This type of communication is based on RF radio frequency magnetic field lines emanating from the reader coil to the card coil. The card then modulates this field with data on a subcarrier for communication back to the reader. In order to properly function sufficient magnetic field lines must pass through the open area of the loop coil of the card. An issue with current technology is that the maximum number of field lines only occurs when the card is held exactly parallel to the reader coil. If the card is held perpendicular to the reader coil there will be no field lines passing through the card coil and no communication will occur. Similarly if the card is held at an angle to the reader there may be insufficient field lines passing through the card antenna and no communication will occur.

In the following description reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments which may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural electrical and optical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following description of example embodiments is therefore not to be taken in a limited sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.

An embodiment of the present disclosure is an electronically reconfigurable antenna that changes the direction of RF current through specified paths in the antenna. A particular embodiment is part of a card reader and allows the card reader antenna to couple to a card when the card is held at any angle with respect to the card reader antenna. This is accomplished by reconfiguring the magnetic field lines of the card reader antenna to sequentially align with the spatial axes x y and z.

Each of B A B A and B illustrate embodiments A B and C. Each figure refers to a state of the antenna that aligns with the x y and z axes respectively. As illustrated in B and B the H field lines relate to the magnetic field strength usually measured in units of A m . In one embodiment the card reader antennas A B and C contain four adjacent loops and three double pole double throw DPDT switches to reconfigure the direction of the current in each of the four loops. The direction of the H field in each loop is determined by the right hand thumb rule according to the electrical current direction.

In the current is directed in a manner such that the H field in all four sections of the antenna is the same all in the z axis . This allows a card to be read when the card is held in the x y plane as illustrated in . In the current is directed in a manner such that the H field in the top two sections of the antenna is opposite that of the H field in the bottom two sections. This allows sufficient field strength in the y axis so that a card can be read when the card is held in the x z plane as illustrated in . In the current is directed in a manner such that the H field in the left two sections of the antenna is opposite that of the H field in the right two sections. This allows sufficient field strength in the x axis so that a card can be read when the card is held in the y z plane as illustrated in .

A controller or microprocessor coupled to the card reader antenna will time multiplex the states of the three switches such that the electrical RF current will flow to create an orientation of the H field that will cycle through the three x y and z orientations. The frequency at which the field orientation is switched should be slow enough to complete an initialization cycle for a card in each of the three field axes. In most applications a frequency of about 5 Hz would suffice. Upon receiving an acknowledge response from the card the switching of the antenna enters a static mode where no further switching of the magnetic field orientation occurs until the communication with the card is complete or communication with the card is lost.

Several embodiments and sub embodiments have been disclosed above and it is envisioned that any embodiment can be combined with any other embodiment or sub embodiment. Specific examples of such combinations are illustrated in the examples below.
