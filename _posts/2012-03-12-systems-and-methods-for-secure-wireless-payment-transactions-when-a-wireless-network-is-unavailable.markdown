The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 452 102 entitled Systems and Methods for Secure Wireless Payment Transactions When a Wireless Network is Unavailable filed on Mar. 12 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

The present invention relates generally to electronic commerce. More specifically but not by way of limitation the present invention relates to systems and methods for conducting wireless payment transactions when a wireless network is unavailable.

Cell coverage is not ubiquitous and cannot be guaranteed to be available in all locations. However some types of mobile device payment systems may connect to services over cellular or other wireless networks to authorize and settle transactions with merchants. Thus the unavailability of a cellular or wireless network can result in a failure to complete the financial transaction. A mobile device user cannot always accurately predict whether a wireless network will be available when the user is choosing to patronize a particular merchant.

Accordingly there may be a need to provide an out of network option to allow mobile device users to use their mobile devices as payment devices even when a wireless network is unavailable.

Illustrative embodiments of the present invention are shown in the drawings and are summarized below. These and other embodiments are more fully described in the Detailed Description section. It is to be understood though that there is no intention to limit the invention to the forms described in this Summary or in the Detailed Description.

Systems methods and devices are disclosed which allow a mobile device user to complete financial transactions even when the mobile device is not connected to a wireless network. The systems methods and devices of the present disclosure may utilizing a combination of an encrypted lockbox containing out of network payment codes on the mobile device and a matching set of out of network payment codes stored on a server of a payment authority.

In a first set of embodiments a method for authorizing a transaction includes receiving at a payment authority server system from a point of sale terminal a request to authorize the transaction using a payment code provided to the point of sale terminal via a mobile device the payment code associated with a state of disconnection between the mobile device and a wireless network determining that the received payment code matches a payment code contained within at least one set of stored payment codes at the payment authority server system authorizing the transaction to the point of sale terminal based on the determination marking the received payment code as used in the at least one set of stored payment codes at the payment authority server system and transmitting a replacement payment code to the mobile device in response to the mobile device connecting to a wireless network

In a second set of embodiments a payment authority server system includes at least one processor and at least one memory communicatively coupled with the at least one processor. The at least one memory stores executable code that when executed by the at least one processor causes the at least one processor to receive from a point of sale terminal a request to authorize a transaction using a payment code provided to the point of sale terminal via a mobile device the payment code associated with a state of disconnection between the mobile device and a wireless network determine that the received payment code matches a payment code contained within at least one set of stored payment codes authorize the transaction to the point of sale terminal based on the determination mark the received payment code as used in the at least one set of stored payment codes at the payment authority server system and transmit a replacement payment code to the mobile device in response to the mobile device connecting to a wireless network.

In a third set of embodiments a method for conducting a transaction includes receiving a request from a user for a payment code at a mobile device determining that a wireless network is unavailable to the mobile device retrieving a payment code from a digital lockbox of the mobile device in response to the determination that the wireless network is unavailable the payment code associated with a state of disconnection between the mobile device and a wireless network providing the retrieved payment code to a point of sale terminal to authorize the transaction and communicating with a payment authority server to receive a replacement payment code for the digital lockbox in response to the mobile device reconnecting to the wireless network.

In the systems methods and devices of the present application a set of out of network payment codes may be stored both at an encrypted lockbox of a mobile device and a payment authority server. When a user of the mobile device chooses to conduct a transaction and the mobile device is out of range of a cellular or other wireless network the mobile device may retrieve an out of network payment code for use in authorizing the transaction. The payment authority may receive the out of network payment code from a merchant point of sale terminal authorize the transaction based on the out of network payment code and render that particular out of network payment code invalid as the transaction is completed. When the mobile device reconnects to the wireless network the mobile device may receive one or more replacement out of network payment codes for storage in the lockbox.

This description provides examples and is not intended to limit the scope applicability or configuration of the invention. Rather the ensuing description will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing embodiments of the invention. Various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements.

Thus various embodiments may omit substitute or add various procedures or components as appropriate. For instance it should be appreciated that the methods may be performed in an order different than that described and that various steps may be added omitted or combined. Also aspects and elements described with respect to certain embodiments may be combined in various other embodiments. It should also be appreciated that the following systems methods devices and software may individually or collectively be components of a larger system wherein other procedures may take precedence over or otherwise modify their application.

As used in the present disclosure and appended claims the term merchant is to be broadly construed as a provider of goods and services. In the following discussion a merchant may be sometimes referred to as the first user. 

A mobile payment card platform in accordance with these illustrative embodiments provides among other things a server side digital wallet and a mobile device side wallet for mobile payment cards that overcomes the shortcomings e.g. risk of loss or theft associated with other payment methods that reside within the mobile device itself. In these illustrative embodiments no credentials account numbers balances or other sensitive information associated with the user s payment methods i.e. cards reside in the mobile device itself. Instead a secure network infrastructure distributes and manages the payment methods and their associated credentials the mobile device acting merely as one means for the user to communicate with the server side digital wallet and the merchant point of sale to access a variety of flexible services surrounding use of the mobile payment methods.

It will be understood that the wireless network utilized by the mobile device referred to herein can be a cellular communication network such as a GSM network a COMA network a 3G network a 4G network WiFi WiMAX etc. Further it will be understood that the mobile device can communicate with the payment card management platform via the Internet or the World Wide Web. Also the mobile device can connect to the payment card management platform via one or more wired or wireless Metropolitan Area networks MANs one or more wired or wireless local area networks LANs one or more wired or wireless Wide Area networks WANs one or more wired or wireless Personal Area networks PANs etc. Further it will be understood that the various components are configured to communicate using the requisite communication protocols and signal schemes.

The system in may build on existing payment systems operated by payment service providers such as without limitation MOCAPAY FIRST DATA and COMDATA. Payment service provider among other things administers the financial aspects of payment cards including keeping track of the balance associated with a particular payment method settlement reporting to merchants and other functions.

Merchant sells goods services or both to consumers either directly or with the assistance of merchant s agent . That is merchant s agent may facilitate the distribution and sale of payment cards issued by merchant by acting as an intermediary between merchant and any of the following 1 a payment card service provider 2 mobile payment card distributors 3 mobile payment card purchasers those giving the mobile payment cards to others and 4 mobile payment card recipients consumers who use the mobile payment cards in commerce . A consumer holding such a mobile payment card can use the mobile device to purchase goods or services from the particular merchant that issued the mobile payment card as explained above. How the holder of a mobile payment card uses the mobile device to make purchases from the issuing merchant is discussed further below. As should be understood from one skilled in the art the use of the mobile device described herein is not limited to the strict use of a payment card but can include the use of loyalty cards coupons gift cards or other incentives.

Payment authority processes the source of funds for transactions carried out from a user s mobile device such as the user s reloading of a mobile payment card or purchase of a mobile payment card on behalf of someone else. In such transactions payment authority acts as an agent of the merchant to collect funds from the user s credit card or other payment source. In some examples an entity acting as a payment authority in certain contexts may also be a distributor in other contexts.

Distributor markets mobile payment cards and in some embodiments is somewhat analogous to an entity such as a grocery store chain which markets conventional plastic magnetically encoded payment cards for a variety of other merchants on racks in its grocery stores with the assistance of a conventional payment card merchant s agent. Distributor can take on a variety of different forms depending on the particular embodiment.

In one example distributor may be an entity not necessarily a merchant that operates a Web site or other electronic communication channel where payment cards for a number of different merchants are offered in an aggregated fashion. In another embodiment a single merchant markets its payment cards via remote distribution channels local distribution channels or both. For example a merchant may market its payment cards via a remote distribution channel such as a Web site or other networked electronic communication channel using Application Programming Interfaces APIs supplied by merchant s agent or another entity. That is a merchant may use flexible APIs provided by merchant s agent to customize a Web site or other networked electronic communication channel to offer its payment cards in a manner consistent with the merchant s particular brand identify logos etc. A merchant may also employ local distribution methods in a store at the point of sale . In such examples the payment card can be mobilized made accessible to the recipient via the recipient s mobile device at the point of sale.

In yet another embodiment distributor may be a social networking Web site where the interests and preferences of a potential mobile payment card recipient are revealed to that person s friends and family. For example John may discover on a social networking web site that his friend Alan likes to shop at a particular merchant and John can purchase a mobile payment card for that merchant at the social networking site for Alan. The above are merely a few examples of distributors . Mobile payment cards can be marketed in a wide variety of ways and settings.

In an illustrative embodiment merchant receives the funds from a user s purchase of a mobile payment card minus a predetermined fee that is paid to the merchant s agent .

In some embodiments mobile device can use a variety of different access methods such as without limitation Short Message Service SMS messages Multimedia Message Service MMS messages Wireless Access Protocol WAP an application or voice to obtain perishable authorization codes from payment authority in making payments from a variety of different tenders forms of payment including mobile payment cards. Mobile device can also use a variety of methods including Near Field Communications NFC and any of the above examples to provide one use perishable authorization codes to merchant point of sale systems in making electronic purchases .

For example mobile device may receive a perishable authorization code for use with a specific transaction. Mobile device may provide the perishable authorization code to a merchant point of sale POS system to pay for a transaction via NFC communications or another method and the merchant POS system may receive payment authorization from the payment authority based on the perishable authorization code. Additional details and examples regarding the use of perishable authorization codes can be found for example in the aforementioned 489 patent.

A user of mobile device may also receive targeted marketing messages before during or after a mobile purchase via payment authority and may purchase mobile payment cards from a carrier or other distributor such as a social networking Web site. The targeted marketing messages are assisted by the ability of merchant point of sale system to submit marketing rules content or both to payment authority .

Payment authority may be an example of payment authority described above with reference to . Payment authority may facilitate the activation of mobile payment cards sold by a carrier or other entity or other distributor in cooperation with payment card system via communication link . Payment card system may also provide among other things settlement and reporting services to the merchant.

When the user of mobile device makes a purchase using a mobile payment card mobile device contacts payment authority using any of a variety of access methods e.g. SMS MMS WAP HTTP or other browser technology application voice to provide an optional personal identification number PIN by which payment authority authenticates mobile device . Payment authority provides mobile device with one time perishable time limited authorization codes and balances for various tenders available to that user including mobile payment cards. In the present example the user of mobile device selects a specific mobile payment card to be used in making the purchase. The mobile payments enabled merchant point of sale system submits the authorization code provided by mobile device and the transaction amount to payment authority . Payment authority routes the transaction parameters to payment card system which ensures that the requested amount is available on the indicated mobile payment card. If everything checks out payment card system informs payment authority which in turn conveys a return authorization to the merchant point of sale system completing the transaction.

With this high level background in place the remainder of this Detailed Description focuses primarily on the use of mobile payment cards when a wireless network is unavailable.

In the example of payment authority server system includes an out of network payment code generation module an out of network payment code receiving module a transaction authorization module and a data store of out of network payment codes. Each of these components may be in communication directly or indirectly. Each of the respective modules in payment authority server system may be implemented by hardware software or a combination of hardware and software. In certain examples a single hardware device may implement the functionality of one or more modules . Additionally or alternatively the functionality of one or more modules may be implemented by a distributed across a number of autonomous devices.

In the present example the out of network payment code generation module generates a number of out of network payment codes for a user of mobile device . These out of network payment codes may be transmitted to mobile device over the Internet and cellular network . Mobile device may receive the out of network payment codes and store them in an encrypted lockbox. A corresponding set of matching out of network payment codes may be associated with the user of the mobile device and stored in data store .

While mobile device is connected to cellular network and the user of mobile device wishes to conduct a transaction mobile device may request and receive dynamically generated perishable payment codes. These perishable payment codes may be associated with specific transactions and provided to merchant POS which routes the perishable payment codes to payment authority over the Internet for authorization.

However if mobile device is disconnected from cellular network e.g. out of range the user of mobile device may still conduct transactions with merchant POS terminals using the generated out of network payment codes stored in the encrypted lockbox of mobile device . When the user of mobile device desires to conduct a transaction and mobile device determines that mobile device is disconnected from cellular network mobile device may prompt the user to authorize use of one of the out of network payment codes. If authorization is given mobile device may provide the out of network payment code to the merchant POS terminals via NFC the display of the mobile device or any other means. The merchant POS may then route the received out of network payment code over the internet to payment authority server system which receives the out of network payment code at out of network payment code receiving module .

Transaction authorization module may determine that the received out of network payment code matches one of the payment codes stored in data store e.g. by comparing the payment code to each of the payment codes stored in data store to identify an identical match and authorize the transaction based on the match. The transaction authorization module may also mark the received out of network payment code used in the data store and render the used code unusable for a predetermined period of time. If payment authority server system receives the same out of network payment code after it has been rendered unusable or if the payment authority server system determines that a received out of network payment code does not match any of the out of network payment codes of data store the transaction may be rejected.

In certain examples the out of network payment code may generate out of network payment codes having two components a first component provided by payment authority server system and a second component known to the user of mobile device . In these examples only the first component of each out of network payment code may be provided to mobile device and the user will be expected to complete the out of network payment code as an added measure of security. In certain examples the length of the out of network payment codes provided to mobile device may be variable.

In certain examples the out of network payment codes provided to and stored by mobile device may have limited periods of validity. Thus while mobile device is connected to cellular network the out of network payment codes may be changed and updated as periods of validity expire. However depending on the location of the user it may be beneficial to adjust the period of validity for one or more of the out of network payment codes based on a location of the mobile device. For example if payment authority server system detects that mobile device is near an area of low reception where a risk of disconnecting from the cellular network is likely the period of validity for one or more of the stored out of network payment codes provided to mobile device may be extended. Additionally or alternatively mobile device may store one or more out of network payment codes that are valid indefinitely.

In the present example mobile device includes payment code request receiving module wireless connectivity evaluation module payment code providing module cellular transceiver NFC transceiver and encrypted lockbox data store which stores out of network payment codes . Each of these components may be in communication directly or indirectly.

As described in the above examples mobile device may communicate with payment authority over cellular network and the Internet to receive perishable payment codes to authorize transactions with merchants. To conduct a transaction the user may first request a payment code at payment code request receiving module . Wireless connectivity evaluation module may communicate with cellular transceiver to determine whether mobile device is connected to cellular network 

When mobile device is in communication with cellular network payment code providing module may request and receive a dynamically generated perishable payment code from payment authority in real time by way of the Internet cellular network and cellular transceiver . Payment code providing module may then provide the received payment code to merchant POS terminal for processing over NFC transceiver or another type of transceiver e.g. Bluetooth Wi Fi etc. . However if mobile device is disconnected from cellular network payment code providing module which decrypts the lockbox data store retrieves one of the out of network payment codes previously provided by payment authority and transmits the out of network payment code to merchant POS over NFC transceiver for processing and approval. The out of network payment code may then be marked as used or invalid and discarded immediately or at a future time. In certain embodiments instead of using transceiver to provide the payment code to merchant POS terminal mobile device may display the payment code to the user and or the merchant and the user and or the merchant may provide the payment code to merchant POS terminal 

In certain examples mobile device may be configured to adjust a period of validity for one or more of the out of network codes stored by encrypted lockbox data store according to a location of mobile device or another criterion. Additionally or alternatively one or more of the out of network payment codes stored by encrypted lockbox data store may be valid for a fixed or indefinite amount of time.

In examples where the payment code includes a first component provided by payment authority and a second component known by the user of mobile device mobile device may prompt the user to enter the second component in order for the payment code to be provided to merchant POS terminal 

Once connectivity with cellular network is regained mobile device may communicate with payment authority to receive replacement out of network payment codes for used or expired out of network payment codes stored by encrypted lockbox data store .

At block a request to authorize a transaction is received from a point of sale terminal using a payment code provided to the point of sale terminal via a mobile device. The received payment code is associated with a state of disconnection between the mobile device and a wireless network. At block it is determined that the received payment code matches a payment code contained within at least one set of stored payment codes at the payment authority server system. At block the transaction is authorized to the point of sale terminal based on the determination of block . At block the received payment code is marked as used in the at least one set of stored payment codes. At block a replacement payment code is transmitted to the mobile device in response to the mobile device connecting to the wireless network.

At block the payment authority determines whether a particular merchant allows the use of out of network payment codes at the merchant s business. For the purposes of this discussion the financial transaction is described as a purchase of goods or services. However one of skill in the art will recognize that the method of the invention can be adapted to any financial transaction. If the merchant allows the use of out of network payment codes the payment authority creates a set of out of network payment codes for a mobile device lockbox associated with a user at block .

A set of payment codes may consist of one or more individual tokens each token can be a randomly generated series of numbers provided by the payment authority. In addition the token can include certain digits generated by the payment authority and certain digits known or selected by the mobile device user. The length of the token is determined by the overall number of payment codes activated by the payment card management platform. For the ease of identification and to ensure quick processing the tokens that make up the out of network payment codes may be a defined length that is different from the defined length of real time payment codes. By way of example only payment codes that are activated on a real time basis through communication with a wireless network may have a length of 5 digits. In order to readily distinguish the out of network payment codes the out of network tokens may have a length of 9 digits.

Once the set of out of network payment codes is created at block the payment authority sets up encryption and a PIN or other access credentials for the lockbox at block . The payment authority then transmits the lockbox to the mobile device at block and stores a matching set of out of network payment codes at the payment authority at block . For ease of organization the payment card management platform can organize the out of network payment codes stored on the platform by merchant or other category that makes matching payment codes received from merchants with stored payment codes.

At an initial set of out of network payment codes is transmitted a mobile device for storage in an encrypted lockbox. At block the initial set of out of network payment codes is stored on a server of the payment authority in a file associated with a specific merchant. At block a request is received from a mobile device to update the out of network payment codes stored at the lockbox of the mobile device. At block new out of network payment codes are generated if a lockbox is not present if a predetermined expiration period for one or more stored out of network payment codes has expired or if one or more stored out of network payment codes have been used. At block a user of the mobile device is prompted to decrypt the lockbox on the mobile device e.g. by entering a decryption PIN or other credential . At block the new out of network payment codes are transmitted to the lockbox of the mobile device. At block the new out of network payment codes are stored on the server of the payment authority.

At block a payment code is received from a point of sale terminal with a request to complete a financial transaction. At block the received payment code is compared to a current list of active real time payment codes. If the received payment code is found in the list of active real time payment codes the transaction is authorized at block . If the received payment code is not found in the list of active real time codes the received payment code is compared to a list of out of network payment codes stored by a server of the payment authority at block . If the received payment code is found in the out of network payment code list the transaction is authorized at block and the out of network payment code is marked on the as used and rendered inoperable at block .

At block a request is received from a user for a payment code at a mobile device. At block a determination is made that a wireless network is unavailable to the mobile device. At block a payment code is retrieved from a digital lockbox of the mobile device in response to the determination that the wireless network is unavailable. The payment code is associated with a state of disconnection between the mobile device and the wireless network. At block the retrieved payment code is provided to a point of sale terminal to authorize the transaction. At block the mobile device communicates with a payment authority server to receive a replacement payment code for the digital lockbox in response to the mobile device reconnecting to the wireless network.

At block an application with an encrypted lockbox is run on a mobile device. At block a user request for a payment code for a financial transaction is received. At block the user is alerted that a network is unavailable and queried as to whether an out of network payment code is to be used. At block user authorization to use an out of network payment code is received. At block the out of network payment code is provided to the user on the display of the mobile device. At block the user provides the out of network payment code to a merchant for authorization of the transaction.

At block a request for a payment code is received from a user. At block an availability of a network e.g. a cellular network is determined. At block the user is queried as to whether an out of network payment code is to be used in response to the unavailability of the network. At block a digital lockbox of the mobile device is decrypted and an out of network payment code is selected in response to the user authorizing use of the out of network payment code. At block the out of network payment code is transmitted to a merchant point of sale terminal via an NFC transceiver to authorize the transaction. At block the out of network payment code is marked as used and further use of that code is prevented. At block the mobile device connects to a wireless network. At block updates are requested from a payment authority server to inform the payment authority server of used out of network payment codes and replace used or expired out of network payment codes in the lockbox with newly generated out of network payment codes.
