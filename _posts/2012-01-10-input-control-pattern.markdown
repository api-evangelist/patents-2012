Shift console assembly is positioned to the right of seat assembly and includes a pedestal coupled to floor of cab and a shift lever operatively connected to pedestal . Pedestal is spaced apart from right control console by about 1.6 inches 4.0 cm . Shift lever or shifter controls transmission .

According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure control system is electronic and interacts with the electrohydraulic systems electrohydraulic valves hydraulic cylinders etc. of motor grader . Thus motor grader is controlled by an electro hydraulic EH system. Wires not shown extend from inputs of control system through cab to the electrohydraulic valves not shown located outside of cab . Because only wires rather than hydraulic lines exit cab cab is sealed better and quieter than if hydraulic lines extended into cab . Although motor grader uses an EH other systems such as all hydraulic systems may be provided for motor grader .

To improve the view of an operator and reduce operator fatigue inputs of control system are placed nearer to the operator. According to the exemplary embodiment inputs are placed on control consoles in front of armrest . By placing inputs on nearer the operator viewing through front wall of cab is not obstructed by mechanical levers and linkages extending through the floor of cab adjacent to front wall . For example as shown in A B and windows extend substantially to floor of cab with no obstruction due to floor mounted control levers. To further place inputs out of the line of sight of the operator some of controls are placed directly over seat of seat assembly .

As shown in seat consoles include forward end or forward portions rearward end or rearward portions console outboard sides and console inboard sides . Consoles define blade viewing recesses radiused torso recesses and leg recesses shown in .

In one illustrative embodiment control consoles are at least partially located below armrests as shown in . By placing control consoles below armrests inputs are in a convenient location for the operator s palms and fingers and are further out of the line of sight of the operator. Rearward portions of consoles are positioned directly below a portion of armrests .

As mentioned above to improve the line of sight of the operator inputs are placed nearer the operator. To facilitate this placement at least a portion of control console is located directly above seat to place several of inputs also directly above seat nearer the operator. For example console inboard side of console is positioned directly above a forward outboard portion of seat as shown in . As a result of this placement innermost portions of control consoles define a control console gap of about 13.4 inches 34.1 cm between control consoles . For reference innermost portions of armrest define an armrest gap of about 19.3 inches 49.1 cm . According to alternative embodiments other control console gaps and armrest gaps are provided. According to the present disclosure the ratio of armrest gap to steering wheel diameter is greater than 1.5. According to the preferred embodiment this ratio is about 1.93 but other ratios may be provided such as 1.25 1.75 2.0 2.5 3.0 etc. According to the present disclosure the ratio of armrest gap to console steering wheel gap is greater than five. According to the preferred embodiment this ratio is about 12.3 but other ratios may be provided such as 3 4 6 8 10 15 20 etc. According to the present disclosure the ratio of armrest gap to console gap is greater than 1.25. According to the preferred embodiment this ratio is about 1.44 but other ratios may be provided such as 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.7 etc.

As also illustrated in leg recesses provides legs with additional space underneath the portions of control consoles positioned directly over seats . Forward downwardly facing surfaces of control consoles that define leg recesses have a higher elevation than reward downwardly facing surfaces of control consoles .

As shown in control system includes a plurality of inputs such as joysticks and switches. In an illustrative embodiment joysticks define a control pattern for motor graders utilizing joysticks . Control system allows operator to finely adjust multiple functions on the motor grader to achieve accurate and precise control during grading operations.

Left control console supports a plurality of joysticks . As shown in front joystick that controls the pitch of blade by moving it forward and backward and controls raising and lower of ripper by moving left and right. Left rear joystick controls the height of the left end of blade by moving it forward and backward. Center rear joystick controls side shifting of blade by moving it forward and backward and controls steering of motor grader by moving in left and right. Once front wheels are turned by moving center rear joystick left or right they remain turned left or right until center rear joystick is moved to the right or left . Steering through using center rear joystick is in addition to steering wheel of vehicle . Thus two inputs are provided on vehicle for controlling steering of front wheels . According to alternative embodiments of the present disclosure the steering and other functions may be controlled by any of the other joysticks . Rear right joystick controls the angle of blade through rotation of the grader circle by moving forward and backward.

Right control console also supports a plurality of joysticks . Front joystick that controls the articulation of motor grader by moving it forward and backward and controls raising and lower of ripper by moving left and right. Left rear joystick controls the side shift of the grader circle by moving it forward and backward. Center rear joystick controls the lean of front wheels of motor grader by moving it forward and backward. Rear right joystick controls the height of the right end of blade by moving it forward and backward.

Joysticks are positioned close enough to facilitate an operator s hand and allow operator to reach each joystick with limited or no arm movement. In the preferred embodiment lateral spacing between joysticks in a row is about 2.6 inches 6.5 cm . Thus the total spread between the tops of joysticks in a row is about 5.2 inches 13.0 cm . The longitudinal spacing between forward and rear joysticks is about 2.7 inches 6.8 cm . The lateral spacing between forward and rear joysticks is about 1.3 inches 3.25 cm . The lateral spacing between inboard joysticks on each control console is about 16.6 inches 4.21 cm .

As shown in on left console left rear joystick includes button assembly facing inward that acts as a left hand integrated grade control or IGC switch. When IGC switch on left rear joystick is pressed this joystick becomes a master blade lift lever so that if left rear joystick is actuated to raise a left end of blade the right end of blade also raises to maintain the slope of blade .

Center rear joystick includes a pair of button assemblies facing inward that acts as an IGC to provide increment decrement. When one of button assemblies is pressed the slope of blade increases by a predetermined increment such as 0.1 degrees. When the other button assembly is pressed the slope of blade decreases by the predetermined increment. Front joystick may also include button assemblies facing forward.

On right console front joystick includes button assembly facing forward that returns the articulation of motor grader to straight. Center rear joystick includes button assemblies facing inward that provide the IGC increment decrement function described above. Thus according to one configuration of the control functions button assemblies of center rear joystick of left console and center rear joystick of right console control the same functions. According another configuration of the control functions these button assemblies control different functions. For example according to one configuration blade is provided with a curb sensor that detects the height of blade relative to a curb. When this feature is activated button assemblies on center rear joystick of left console can control the increment decrement of the blade height and button assemblies of center rear joystick of right console can control the slope of blade .

Rear right joystick includes button assembly facing inward that acts as a right hand IGC switch. When IGC switch on right rear joystick is pressed this joystick becomes a master blade lift lever so that if right rear joystick is actuated to raise a right end of blade the left end of blade also raises to maintain the slope of blade .

As shown in control system also includes auxiliary joystick inputs such as auxiliary joysticks differential lock switch as well as float switches . A horn button may be provided to the right of float switches or elsewhere. Differential lock switch control the locking and unlocking of the motor grader differential.

Float switches control the float function of the ground engaging devices supported by motor grader . The float function allows blade and the other ground engage blades such as snow plows snow wings etc. to float or ride over the hard surfaces such as pavement rather than be rigid relative to the hard surface. For example when the float function is activated the hydraulic cylinders controlling snow plow would not be in a rigid fixed position but would allow snow plow to float over the pavement so that any rollers supporting the snow plow could roll over the pavement and avoid snow plow gouging the payment. As shown in each float switch includes left middle and right bubble switches . Middle bubble switch is raised relative to left and right bubble switches to allow a user to locate it tactilely. Middle bubble switch on left float switch controls the float of the left end of blade and the middle bubble switch on right float switch controls the float of the right end of blade . Left and right bubble switches control the float function of auxiliary attachments such as snow plows and snow wings .

Several auxiliary functions are controlled by mini auxiliary joysticks by moving them forward and backward and right and left. Additional auxiliary functions are provided by front joystick stick on left console by using the unused axes of movement of primary joysticks and or primary joysticks without button assemblies . The auxiliary functions control the operation of accessories attached to motor grader not including blade . Such attachments may include rippers snow plow and snow wing that are attached to the front end or sides of motor grader . These functions may include the position height or lateral position and orientation pitch rotation etc. 

When left armrest and left console are raised in direction a sensor not shown detects this movement and disables the controls such as joysticks and the other controls. If an operation of motor grader is active when left armrest and left console are raised the operation is terminated.

Blade viewing recess is configured to allow operator shown in to view a portion of grader blade such as blade toe or blade heel as shown in . Reference to blade toe and blade heel depends on the direction in which the blade is rotated. When grader blade is rotated to the position shown in phantom in the operator s line of site may extend through blade viewing recess so that less of console is blocking the operator s view. As previously described inputs control functions of grader blade so that blade viewing recess allows operator to view the result of a control function of motor grader while simultaneously viewing blade . Armrest is configured to adjust in height and angle to allow the operator to adjust the position of recess and otherwise increase their visibility.

As shown in front vertical posts separate side walls and front wall . Similarly middle vertical posts divide side walls . Because front vertical posts are at the extreme lateral edge of cab they do not block the view of the operator looking forward. Thus the operator may see implements supported by the front of chassis such as front ripper or a snow blade shown in phantom . Similarly because middle vertical posts are positioned behind the front of seat assembly they do not block the operator s view of blade .

In this embodiment as shown in consoles include console primary bases which supports joysticks and consoles includes console secondary bases which supports auxiliary joysticks differential switch and float switches . Console primary base is illustrated as higher than console secondary base to provide approximately one inch 2.5 cm of clearance. As shown in joysticks include an uppermost surface that is higher than auxiliary joysticks .

An alternative embodiment console is shown in . Console includes base . Console is coupled to motor grader in an arrangement similar to console . Base defines first joystick slot and second joystick slot . First joystick slot provides first joystick slot longitudinal axis .

As shown in joysticks are configured to mount to base and are configured to adjustably move along longitudinal axes . Mount slot as well as first and second joystick slots and allow for translation of joysticks along longitudinal axes in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of chassis . Joysticks are not limited to a particular mount location but may be positioned relative to console or each other depending on the preference of the operator. Joysticks are configured to remain coupled to the control system of vehicle so they remain functional even while being moved from one location such as a first mount location to a lateral second location. As also shown in fasteners are located within mount slots and fasten to joystick mounts to hold joysticks in place.

Joysticks are modular. If a joystick needs replaced or repaired individual joysticks may be removed and replaced without having to remove the remaining joysticks . If a joystick fails in the field the function of the failed joystick can be switched to another joystick . If necessary the functionality of the other joystick can be disabled when replaced. The functionality can be switched to another joystick through the motor grader touch screen monitor shown in . For example if rear center joystick on left control console fails the side shift function can be transferred to another joystick such as one of auxiliary joysticks or one of the lesser used primary joysticks .

The functionality of joysticks can also be reconfigured to satisfy the preferences of the operator. For example the left blade lift function provided by left rear joystick of left console may be shifted to center rear joystick of right console which is adjacent to right rear joystick that provides the right blade lift function. In this configuration both the left end and right end blade lift functions are on adjacent joysticks .
