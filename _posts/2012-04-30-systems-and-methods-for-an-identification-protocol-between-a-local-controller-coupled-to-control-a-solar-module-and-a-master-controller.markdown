title: Systems and methods for an identification protocol between a local controller coupled to control a solar module and a master controller
abstract: Systems and methods for local and master management units in a photovoltaic energy system. In one embodiment, a method implemented in a computer system includes sending a first identification code from a local management unit to a master management unit. The first identification code is associated with the first local management unit, and the local management unit controls a solar module. An authentication of the first identification code is received from the master management unit. In response to receiving the authentication, active operation of the local management unit is continued (e.g., for a set time period).
