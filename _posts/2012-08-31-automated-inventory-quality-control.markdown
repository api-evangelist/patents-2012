Modern inventory systems face increasing demands to efficiently fulfill orders despite increasing complexity and diversity of inventories and orders. Inventory systems however often suffer from misplaced missing or otherwise incorrect inventory that may lower system throughput cause unfinished or delayed tasks and result in unacceptable response times. For example a certain inventory item may be placed in a wrong location and thus may not be located in order to fulfill an order. As another example a worker may remove an incorrect inventory item from a location when attempting to fulfill an order. Accordingly inventory systems face the challenge of effectively controlling inventory in order to meet rising demands.

Inventory systems are utilized by many entities for storing and managing inventory. For example some retailers may utilize a warehouse of racks that store inventory items in various bins. When an order for a specific inventory item needs to be filled by the retailer a worker typically retrieves the inventory item from the bin where the inventory item is stored.

Typical inventory systems face many quality control challenges due to human interaction with the inventory. For example an inventory item may be placed in an incorrect bin by a worker when it is being stocked or after it has been returned by a customer. As another example a worker may remove an incorrect inventory item from a rack of bins when an order is being filled. As yet another example a retailer may be the victim of theft in which inventory items are removed from bins without the retailer s knowledge. These and other inventory quality control issues are undesirable because they may reduce system throughput increase costs and result in unacceptable response times.
