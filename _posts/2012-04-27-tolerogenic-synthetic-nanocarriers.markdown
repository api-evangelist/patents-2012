It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments of the invention only and is not intended to be limiting of the use of alternative terminology to describe the present invention.

All publications patents and patent applications cited herein whether supra or infra are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

As used in this specification and the appended claims the singular forms a an and the include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. For example reference to a polymer includes a mixture of two or more such molecules or a mixture of differing molecular weights of a single polymer species reference to a synthetic nanocarrier includes a mixture of two or more such synthetic nanocarriers or a plurality of such synthetic nanocarriers reference to a DNA molecule includes a mixture of two or more such DNA molecules or a plurality of such DNA molecules reference to an immunosuppressant includes a mixture of two or more such materials or a plurality of immunosuppressant molecules and the like.

As used herein the term comprise or variations thereof such as comprises or comprising are to be read to indicate the inclusion of any recited integer e.g. a feature element characteristic property method process step or limitation or group of integers e.g. features element characteristics properties method process steps or limitations but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers. Thus as used herein the term comprising is inclusive and does not exclude additional unrecited integers or method process steps.

In embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided herein comprising may be replaced with consisting essentially of or consisting of . The phrase consisting essentially of is used herein to require the specified integer s or steps as well as those which do not materially affect the character or function of the claimed invention. As used herein the term consisting is used to indicate the presence of the recited integer e.g. a feature element characteristic property method process step or limitation or group of integers e.g. features element characteristics properties method process steps or limitations alone.

As previously mentioned current conventional immunosuppressants are broad acting and generally result in an overall systemic down regulation of the immune system. The compositions and methods provided herein allow for more targeted immune effects by for example allowing for the targeted delivery to immune cells of interest. Thus the compositions and methods can achieve immune suppression in a more directed manner. As shown in the Examples compositions of the invention were used successfully to result in the generation of regulatory cells and to reduce T cell activation as evidenced by reduction of CD69.

The inventors have unexpectedly and surprisingly discovered that the problems and limitations noted above can be overcome by practicing the invention disclosed herein. In particular the inventors have unexpectedly discovered that it is possible to provide compositions and related methods that provide immune suppression and in some embodiments antigen specific tolerogenic effects. The compositions described herein are compositions that comprise 1 a population of synthetic nanocarriers to which an immunosuppressant is coupled and 2 an antigen presenting cell APC presentable antigen. The efficient uptake by APCs of such compositions is a convenient way in vivo and in vitro to shift the immune response in favor of immune suppressive effects e.g. tolerogenic effects such as regulatory T Treg cell development specific to the APC presentable antigen.

In one embodiment the APC presentable antigen is coupled to the same synthetic nanocarriers to which the immunosuppressant is coupled. In another embodiment the APC presentable antigen is coupled to different synthetic nanocarriers. In still another embodiment the APC presentable antigen is not coupled to a synthetic nanocarrier. In another embodiment the immunosuppressant in the composition is in an amount effective to generate a tolerogenic immune response to the APC presentable antigen.

In still another embodiment the load of the immunosuppressant on average across the population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.0001 and 50 weight weight . In a further embodiment the load of the APC presentable antigen on average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.0001 and 50 weight weight . Preferably in some embodiments the load of the immunosuppressant on average across the population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.1 and 10 weight weight and or the load of the APC presentable antigen on average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers is between 0.1 and 10 weight weight .

In another aspect dosage forms of any of the compositions herein are provided. Such dosage forms can be administered to a subject in need thereof such as subjects in need of antigen specific tolerance. In one embodiment the subject is one that has or is at risk of having an autoimmune disease an inflammatory disease organ or tissue rejection graft versus host disease or an allergy. In another embodiment the subject is one that has undergone or will undergo transplantation. In still another embodiment the subject is one that has been or will be treated with a therapeutic agent that stimulates an undesired immune response.

 Administering or administration means providing a material to a subject in a manner that is pharmacologically useful.

 Allergens are any substances that can cause an undesired e.g. a Type 1 hypersensitive immune response i.e. an allergic response or reaction in a subject.

Allergens include but are not limited to plant allergens e.g. pollen ragweed allergen insect allergens insect sting allergens e.g. bee sting allergens animal allergens e.g. pet allergens such as animal dander or cat Fel d 1 antigen latex allergens mold allergens fungal allergens cosmetic allergens drug allergens food allergens dust insect venom viruses bacteria etc. Food allergens include but are not limited to milk allergens egg allergens nut allergens e.g. peanut or tree nut allergens etc. e.g. walnuts cashews etc. fish allergens shellfish allergens soy allergens legume allergens seed allergens and wheat allergens.

Subjects that may be treated with any of the compositions and methods provided also include those who have or are at risk of having an allergy to any of the allergens provided.

An allergy also referred to herein as an allergic condition is any condition where there is an undesired e.g. a Type 1 hypersensitive immune response i.e. allergic response or reaction to a substance. Such substances are referred to herein as allergens. Allergies or allergic conditions include but are not limited to allergic asthma hay fever hives eczema plant allergies bee sting allergies pet allergies latex allergies mold allergies cosmetic allergies food allergies allergic rhinitis or coryza topic allergic reactions anaphylaxis atopic dermatitis hypersensitivity reactions and other allergic conditions. The allergic reaction may be the result of an immune reaction to any allergen. In some embodiments the allergy is a food allergy. Food allergies include but are not limited to milk allergies egg allergies nut allergies fish allergies shellfish allergies soy allergies or wheat allergies.

 Amount effective in the context of a composition or dosage form for administration to a subject refers to an amount of the composition or dosage form that produces one or more desired immune responses in the subject for example the generation of a tolerogenic immune response. Therefore in some embodiments an amount effective is any amount of a composition provided herein that produces one or more of these desired immune responses. This amount can be for in vitro or in vivo purposes. For in vivo purposes the amount can be one that a clinician would believe may have a clinical benefit for a subject in need of antigen specific tolerization. Such subjects include those that have or are at risk of having an inflammatory disease an autoimmune disease an allergy organ or tissue rejection or graft versus host disease. Such subjects also include those that have undergone or will undergo transplantation. Such subjects further include those that have experienced are experiencing or are expected to experience an undesired immune response against a therapeutic protein.

Amounts effective can involve only reducing the level of an undesired immune response although in some embodiments it involves preventing an undesired immune response altogether. Amounts effective can also involve delaying the occurrence of an undesired immune response. An amount that is effective can also be an amount of a composition provided herein that produces a desired therapeutic endpoint or a desired therapeutic result. Amounts effective preferably result in a tolerogenic immune response in a subject to an antigen. The achievement of any of the foregoing can be monitored by routine methods.

In some embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided the amount effective is one in which the desired immune response persists in the subject for at least 1 week at least 2 weeks at least 1 month at least 2 months at least 3 months at least 4 months at least 5 months at least 6 months at least 9 months at least 1 year at least 2 years at least 5 years or longer. In other embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided the amount effective is one which produces a measurable desired immune response for example a measurable decrease in an immune response e.g. to a specific antigen for at least 1 week at least 2 weeks at least 1 month at least 2 months at least 3 months at least 4 months at least 5 months at least 6 months at least 9 months at least 1 year at least 2 years at least 5 years or longer.

Amounts effective will depend of course on the particular subject being treated the severity of a condition disease or disorder the individual patient parameters including age physical condition size and weight the duration of the treatment the nature of concurrent therapy if any the specific route of administration and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the health practitioner. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum dose be used that is the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art however that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons psychological reasons or for virtually any other reason.

In general doses of the immunosuppressants and or antigens in the compositions of the invention can range from about 10 g kg to about 100 000 g kg. In some embodiments the doses can range from about 0.1 mg kg to about 100 mg kg. In still other embodiments the doses can range from about 0.1 mg kg to about 25 mg kg about 25 mg kg to about 50 mg kg about 50 mg kg to about 75 mg kg or about 75 mg kg to about 100 mg kg. Alternatively the dose can be administered based on the number of synthetic nanocarriers that provide the desired amount of immunosuppressants and or antigens. For example useful doses include greater than 10 10 10 10or 10synthetic nanocarriers per dose. Other examples of useful doses include from about 1 10to about 1 10 about 1 10to about 1 10or about 1 10to about 1 10synthetic nanocarriers per dose.

 Antigen means a B cell antigen or T cell antigen. Type s of antigens means molecules that share the same or substantially the same antigenic characteristics. In some embodiments antigens may be proteins polypeptides peptides lipoproteins glycolipids polynucleotides polysaccharides or are contained or expressed in cells. In some embodiments such as when the antigens are not well defined or characterized the antigens may be contained within a cell or tissue preparation cell debris cell exosomes conditioned media etc. An antigen can be combined with the synthetic nanocarriers in the same form as what a subject is exposed to that causes an undesired immune response but may also be a fragment or derivative thereof. When a fragment or derivative however a desired immune response to the form encountered by such a subject is the preferable result with the compositions and methods provided.

 Antigen specific refers to any immune response that results from the presence of the antigen or portion thereof or that generates molecules that specifically recognize or bind the antigen. For example where the immune response is antigen specific antibody production antibodies are produced that specifically bind the antigen. As another example where the immune response is antigen specific B cell or T cell proliferation and or activity the proliferation and or activity results from recognition of the antigen or portion thereof alone or in complex with MHC molecules by B cells etc.

 Antigens associated with a disease disorder or condition provided herein are antigens that can generate an undesired immune response against as a result of or in conjunction with the disease disorder or condition the cause of the disease disorder or condition or a symptom or effect thereof and or can generate an undesired immune response that is a symptom result or effect of the disease disorder or condition. Preferably in some embodiments the use of an antigen associated with a disease disorder or condition etc. in the compositions and methods provided herein will lead to a tolerogenic immune response against the antigen and or the cells by on or in which the antigen is expressed. The antigens can be in the same form as expressed in a subject with the disease disorder or condition but may also be a fragment or derivative thereof. When a fragment or derivative however a desired immune response to the form expressed in such a subject is the preferable result with the compositions and methods provided. The antigens associated with a disease disorder or condition etc. in some embodiments comprise MHC Class I restricted epitopes and or MHC Class II restricted epitopes and or B cell epitopes and or comprise a lipid that binds to and forms a CD1d complex.

In one embodiment the antigen is an antigen associated with an inflammatory disease autoimmune disease organ or tissue rejection or graft versus host disease. Such antigens include autoantigens such as myelin basic protein collagen e.g. collagen type 11 human cartilage gp 39 chromogranin A gp130 RAPS proteolipid protein fibrillarin nuclear proteins nucleolar proteins e.g. small nucleolar protein thyroid stimulating factor receptor histones glycoprotein gp 70 ribosomal proteins pyruvate dehydrogenase dehydrolipoamide acetyltransferase hair follicle antigens human tropomyosin isoform 5 mitochondrial proteins pancreatic cell proteins myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein insulin glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD gluten and fragments or derivatives thereof. Other autoantigens are provided in Table 1 below.

Antigens also include those associated with an allergy. Such antigens include the allergens described elsewhere herein.

Antigens also include those associated with a transplantable graft. Such antigens are associated with a transplantable graft or an undesired immune response in a recipient of a transplantable graft that is generated as a result of the introduction of the transplantable graft in the recipient that can be presented for recognition by cells of the immune system and that can generate an undesired immune response. Transplant antigens include those associated with organ or tissue rejection or graft versus host disease. Transplant antigens may be obtained or derived from cells of a biological material or from information related to a transplantable graft. Transplant antigens generally include proteins polypeptides peptides lipoproteins glycolipids polynucleotides or are contained or expressed in cells. Information related to a transplantable graft is any information about a transplantable graft that can be used to obtain or derive transplant antigens. Such information includes information about antigens that would be expected to be present in or on cells of a transplantable graft such as for example sequence information types or classes of antigens and or their MHC Class I MHC Class II or B cell presentation restrictions. Such information may also include information about the type of transplantable graft e.g. autograft allograft xenograft the molecular and cellular composition of the graft the bodily location from which the graft is derived or to which the graft is to be transplanted e.g. whole or partial organ skin bone nerves tendon neurons blood vessels fat cornea etc. .

Antigens also include antigens associated with a therapeutic protein that can be presented for recognition by cells of the immune system and that can generate an undesired immune response against the therapeutic protein. Therapeutic protein antigens generally include proteins polypeptides peptides lipoproteins or are contained or expressed in by or on cells.

Antigens can be antigens that are fully defined or characterized. However in some embodiments an antigen is not fully defined or characterized. Antigens therefore also include those that are contained within a cell or tissue preparation cell debris cell exosome or conditioned media and can be delivered in such form in some embodiments.

 APC presentable antigen means an antigen that can be presented for recognition by cells of the immune system such as presented by antigen presenting cells including but not limited to dendritic cells B cells or macrophages. The APC presentable antigen can be presented for recognition by for example T cells. Such antigens may be recognized by and trigger an immune response in a T cell via presentation of the antigen or portion thereof bound to a Class I or Class II major histocompatability complex molecule MHC or bound to a CD1d molecule. CD1d is an antigen presenting molecule that binds self and foreign lipids and glycolipids and is often found on antigen presenting cells. It is also found on non hematopoietic cells such as hepatocytes. CD1d contains a hydrophobic groove which binds hydrophobic lipids usually for presentation to iNKT cells. Preferably one or more tolerogenic immune responses specific to the APC presentable antigen results with the compositions provided herein. Such immune responses can be affected for example via the stimulation production induction or recruitment of regulatory cells such as CD4Treg cells and or CD8Treg cells.

APC presentable antigens generally include peptides polypeptides whole proteins or whole cell lysates. In one embodiment the APC presentable antigen comprises an MHC class I restricted epitope. In another embodiment the APC presentable antigen comprises an MHC class II restricted epitope. In another embodiment the APC presentable antigen comprises a B cell epitope. In another embodiment however the APC presentable antigen is a lipid that binds to or forms a CD1d complex.

In further embodiments the APC presentable antigens in the inventive compositions are provided in the form of a nucleic acid that encodes the peptide polypeptide or protein. The nucleic acid may be DNA or RNA such as mRNA. In embodiments the inventive compositions comprise a complement such as a full length complement or a degenerate due to degeneracy of the genetic code of any of the nucleic acids provided herein. In embodiments the nucleic acid is an expression vector that can be transcribed when transfected into a cell line. In embodiments the expression vector may comprise a plasmid retrovirus or an adenovirus amongst others.

In one embodiment the antigen is associated with a disease disorder or condition described herein and can in combination with an immunosuppressant lead to a tolerogenic immune response specific to the disease disorder or condition.

 Assessing an immune response refers to any measurement or determination of the level presence or absence reduction increase in etc. of an immune response in vitro or in vivo. Such measurements or determinations may be performed on one or more samples obtained from a subject. Such assessing can be performed with any of the methods provided herein or otherwise known in the art.

An at risk subject is one in which a health practitioner believes has a chance of having a disease disorder or condition as provided herein or is one a health practitioner believes has a chance of experiencing an undesired immune response as provided herein.

An autoimmune disease is any disease where the immune system mounts an undesired immune response against self e.g. one or more autoantigens . In some embodiments an autoimmune disease comprises an aberrant destruction of cells of the body as part of the self targeted immune response. In some embodiments the destruction of self manifests in the malfunction of an organ for example the colon or pancreas. Examples of autoimmune diseases are described elsewhere herein. Additional autoimmune diseases will be known to those of skill in the art and the invention is not limited in this respect.

 B cell antigen means any antigen that triggers an immune response in a B cell e.g. an antigen that is specifically recognized by a B cell or a receptor thereon . In some embodiments an antigen that is a T cell antigen is also a B cell antigen. In other embodiments the T cell antigen is not also a B cell antigen. B cell antigens include but are not limited to proteins peptides small molecules and carbohydrates. In some embodiments the B cell antigen comprises a non protein antigen i.e. not a protein or peptide antigen . In some embodiments the B cell antigen comprises a autoantigen. In other embodiments the B cell antigen is obtained or derived from an allergen autoantigen therapeutic protein or transplantable graft.

 Concomitantly means administering two or more substances to a subject in a manner that is correlated in time preferably sufficiently correlated in time so as to provide a modulation in an immune response. In embodiments concomitant administration may occur through administration of two or more substances in the same dosage form. In other embodiments concomitant administration may encompass administration of two or more substances in different dosage forms but within a specified period of time preferably within 1 month more preferably within 1 week still more preferably within 1 day and even more preferably within 1 hour.

 Couple or Coupled or Couples and the like means to chemically associate one entity for example a moiety with another. In some embodiments the coupling is covalent meaning that the coupling occurs in the context of the presence of a covalent bond between the two entities. In non covalent embodiments the non covalent coupling is mediated by non covalent interactions including but not limited to charge interactions affinity interactions metal coordination physical adsorption host guest interactions hydrophobic interactions TT stacking interactions hydrogen bonding interactions van der Waals interactions magnetic interactions electrostatic interactions dipole dipole interactions and or combinations thereof. In embodiments encapsulation is a form of coupling.

 Dosage form means a pharmacologically and or immunologically active material in a medium carrier vehicle or device suitable for administration to a subject.

 Encapsulate means to enclose at least a portion of a substance within a synthetic nanocarrier. In some embodiments a substance is enclosed completely within a synthetic nanocarrier. In other embodiments most or all of a substance that is encapsulated is not exposed to the local environment external to the synthetic nanocarrier. In other embodiments no more than 50 40 30 20 10 or 5 weight weight is exposed to the local environment. Encapsulation is distinct from absorption which places most or all of a substance on a surface of a synthetic nanocarrier and leaves the substance exposed to the local environment external to the synthetic nanocarrier.

 Epitope also known as an antigenic determinant is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system specifically by for example antibodies B cells or T cells. As used herein MHC Class I restricted epitopes are epitopes that are presented to immune cells by MHC class 1 molecules found on nucleated cells. MHC Class II restricted epitopes are epitopes that are presented to immune cells by MHC class II molecules found on antigen presenting cells APCs for example on professional antigen presenting immune cells such as on macrophages B cells and dendritic cells or on non hematopoietic cells such as hepatocytes. B cell epitopes are molecular structures that are recognized by antibodies or B cells. In some embodiments the epitope itself is an antigen.

A number of epitopes are known to those of skill in the art and exemplary epitopes suitable according to some aspects of this invention include but are not limited to those listed in the Immune Epitope Database www.immuneepitope.org Vita R Zarebski L Greenbaum J A Emami H Hoof I Salimi N Damle R Sette A Peters B.

 Generating means causing an action such as an immune response e.g. a tolerogenic immune response to occur either directly oneself or indirectly such as but not limited to an unrelated third party that takes an action through reliance on one s words or deeds.

 Identifying is any action or set of actions that allows a clinician to recognize a subject as one who may benefit from the methods and compositions provided herein. Preferably the identified subject is one who is in need of a tolerogenic immune response as provided herein. The action or set of actions may be either directly oneself or indirectly such as but not limited to an unrelated third party that takes an action through reliance on one s words or deeds.

 Immunosuppressant means a compound that causes an APC to have an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect . An immunosuppressive effect generally refers to the production or expression of cytokines or other factors by the APC that reduces inhibits or prevents an undesired immune response or that promotes a desired immune response. When the APC results in an immunosuppressive effect on immune cells that recognize an antigen presented by the APC the immunosuppressive effect is said to be specific to the presented antigen. Such effect is also referred to herein as a tolerogenic effect. Without being bound by any particular theory it is thought that the immunosuppressive is a result of the immunosuppressant being delivered to the APC preferably in the presence of an antigen e.g. an administered antigen or one that is already present in vivo . Accordingly the immunosuppressant includes compounds that provide a tolerogenic immune response to an antigen that may or may not be provided in the same composition or a different composition. In one embodiment the immunosuppressant is one that causes an APC to promote a regulatory phenotype in one or more immune effector cells. For example the regulatory phenotype may be characterized by the production induction stimulation or recruitment of regulatory immune cells. This may be the result of the conversion of CD4 T cells e.g. CD4 CD25highFoxP3 Treg cells to a regulatory phenotype. This may also be the result of induction of FoxP3 in other immune cells such as CD8 T cells macrophages and iNKT cells. In one embodiment the immunosuppressant is one that affects the response of the APC after it processes an antigen. In another embodiment the immunosuppressant is not one that interferes with the processing of the antigen. In a further embodiment the immunosuppressant is not an apoptotic signaling molecule. In another embodiment the immunosuppressant is not a phospholipid.

Immunosuppressants include but are not limited to statins mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin or a rapamycin analog TGF signaling agents TGF receptor agonists histone deacetylase inhibitors such as Trichostatin A corticosteroids inhibitors of mitochondrial function such as rotenone P38 inhibitors NF inhibitors such as 6Bio Dexamethasone TCPA 1 IKK VII adenosine receptor agonists prostaglandin E2 agonists PGE2 such as Misoprostol phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor PDE4 such as Rolipram proteasome inhibitors kinase inhibitors G protein coupled receptor agonists G protein coupled receptor antagonists glucocorticoids retinoids cytokine inhibitors cytokine receptor inhibitors cytokine receptor activators peroxisome proliferator activated receptor antagonists peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonists histone deacetylase inhibitors calcineurin inhibitors phosphatase inhibitors PI3 KB inhibitors such as TGX 221 autophagy inhibitors such as 3 Methyladenine aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors proteasome inhibitor I PSI and oxidized ATPs such as P2X receptor blockers. Immunosuppressants also include IDO vitamin D3 cyclosporins such as cyclosporine A aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibitors resveratrol azathiopurine Aza 6 mercaptopurine 6 MP 6 thioguanine 6 TG FK506 sanglifehrin A salmeterol mycophenolate mofetil MMF aspirin and other COX inhibitors niflumic acid estriol and triptolide. In embodiments the immunosuppressant may comprise any of the agents provided herein.

The immunosuppressant can be a compound that directly provides the immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect on APCs or it can be a compound that provides the immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect indirectly i.e. after being processed in some way after administration . Immunosuppressants therefore include prodrug forms of any of the compounds provided herein.

Immunosuppressants also include nucleic acids that encode the peptides polypeptides or proteins provided herein that result in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic immune response. In embodiments therefore the immunosuppressant is a nucleic acid that encodes a peptide polypeptide or protein that results in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic immune response and it is the nucleic acid that is coupled to the synthetic nanocarrier.

The nucleic acid may be DNA or RNA such as mRNA. In embodiments the inventive compositions comprise a complement such as a full length complement or a degenerate due to degeneracy of the genetic code of any of the nucleic acids provided herein. In embodiments the nucleic acid is an expression vector that can be transcribed when transfected into a cell line. In embodiments the expression vector may comprise a plasmid retrovirus or an adenovirus amongst others. Nucleic acids can be isolated or synthesized using standard molecular biology approaches for example by using a polymerase chain reaction to produce a nucleic acid fragment which is then purified and cloned into an expression vector.

In embodiments the immunosuppressants provided herein are coupled to synthetic nanocarriers. In preferable embodiments the immunosuppressant is an element that is in addition to the material that makes up the structure of the synthetic nanocarrier. For example in one embodiment where the synthetic nanocarrier is made up of one or more polymers the immunosuppressant is a compound that is in addition and coupled to the one or more polymers. As another example in one embodiment where the synthetic nanocarrier is made up of one or more lipids the immunosuppressant is again in addition and coupled to the one or more lipids. In embodiments such as where the material of the synthetic nanocarrier also results in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect the immunosuppressant is an element present in addition to the material of the synthetic nanocarrier that results in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic effect.

Other exemplary immunosuppressants include but are not limited small molecule drugs natural products antibodies e.g. antibodies against CD20 CD3 CD4 biologics based drugs carbohydrate based drugs nanoparticles liposomes RNAi antisense nucleic acids aptamers methotrexate NSAIDs fingolimod natalizumab alemtuzumab anti CD3 tacrolimus FK506 etc. Further immunosuppressants are known to those of skill in the art and the invention is not limited in this respect.

In some embodiments of the above embodiments the load of the immunosuppressant and or the antigen is no more than 25 on average across a population of synthetic nanocarriers. In embodiments the load is calculated as described in the Examples.

In embodiments of any of the compositions and methods provided the load is calculated as follows Approximately 3 mg of synthetic nanocarriers are collected and centrifuged to separate supernatant from synthetic nanocarrier pellet. Acetonitrile is added to the pellet and the sample is sonicated and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. The supernatant and pellet are injected on RP HPLC and absorbance is read at 278 nm. The g found in the pellet is used to calculate entrapped load g in supernatant and pellet are used to calculate totall g recovered.

 Maintenance dose refers to a dose that is administered to a subject after an initial dose has resulted in an immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic response in a subject to sustain a desired immunosuppressive e.g. tolerogenic response. A maintenance dose for example can be one that maintains the tolerogenic effect achieved after the initial dose prevents an undesired immune response in the subject or prevents the subject becoming a subject at risk of experiencing an undesired immune response including an undesired level of an immune response. In some embodiments the maintenance dose is one that is sufficient to sustain an appropriate level of a desired immune response.

 Maximum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier means the largest dimension of a nanocarrier measured along any axis of the synthetic nanocarrier. Minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier means the smallest dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier measured along any axis of the synthetic nanocarrier. For example for a spheroidal synthetic nanocarrier the maximum and minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be substantially identical and would be the size of its diameter. Similarly for a cuboidal synthetic nanocarrier the minimum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be the smallest of its height width or length while the maximum dimension of a synthetic nanocarrier would be the largest of its height width or length. In an embodiment a minimum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or greater than 100 nm. In an embodiment a maximum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or less than 5 m. Preferably a minimum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is greater than 110 nm more preferably greater than 120 nm more preferably greater than 130 nm and more preferably still greater than 150 nm. Aspects ratios of the maximum and minimum dimensions of inventive synthetic nanocarriers may vary depending on the embodiment. For instance aspect ratios of the maximum to minimum dimensions of the synthetic nanocarriers may vary from 1 1 to 1 000 000 1 preferably from 1 1 to 100 000 1 more preferably from 1 1 to 10 000 1 more preferably from 1 1 to 1000 1 still more preferably from 1 1 to 100 1 and yet more preferably from 1 1 to 10 1. Preferably a maximum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or less than 3 m more preferably equal to or less than 2 m more preferably equal to or less than 1 m more preferably equal to or less than 800 nm more preferably equal to or less than 600 nm and more preferably still equal to or less than 500 nm. In preferred embodiments a minimum dimension of at least 75 preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 90 of the synthetic nanocarriers in a sample based on the total number of synthetic nanocarriers in the sample is equal to or greater than 100 nm more preferably equal to or greater than 120 nm more preferably equal to or greater than 130 nm more preferably equal to or greater than 140 nm and more preferably still equal to or greater than 150 nm. Measurement of synthetic nanocarrier dimensions e.g. diameter is obtained by suspending the synthetic nanocarriers in a liquid usually aqueous media and using dynamic light scattering DLS e.g. using a Brookhaven ZetaPALS instrument . For example a suspension of synthetic nanocarriers can be diluted from an aqueous buffer into purified water to achieve a final synthetic nanocarrier suspension concentration of approximately 0.01 to 0.1 mg mL. The diluted suspension may be prepared directly inside or transferred to a suitable cuvette for DLS analysis. The cuvette may then be placed in the DLS allowed to equilibrate to the controlled temperature and then scanned for sufficient time to acquire a stable and reproducible distribution based on appropriate inputs for viscosity of the medium and refractive indicies of the sample. The effective diameter or mean of the distribution is then reported. Dimension or size or diameter of synthetic nanocarriers means the mean of a particle size distribution obtained using dynamic light scattering.

 MHC refers to major histocompatibility complex a large genomic region or gene family found in most vertebrates that encodes MHC molecules that display fragments or epitopes of processed proteins on the cell surface. The presentation of MHC peptide on cell surfaces allows for surveillance by immune cells usually a T cell. There are two general classes of MHC molecules Class I and Class II. Generally Class I MHC molecules are found on nucleated cells and present peptides to cytotoxic T cells. Class II MHC molecules are found on certain immune cells chiefly macrophages B cells and dendritic cells collectively known as professional APCs. The best known genes in the MHC region are the subset that encodes antigen presenting proteins on the cell surface. In humans these genes are referred to as human leukocyte antigen HLA genes.

Any other therapeutic and or prophylactic effect may also be assessed instead of or in addition to the aforementioned immune responses. Whether or not a protocol had a desired effect can be determined using any of the methods provided herein or otherwise known in the art. For example a population of cells may be obtained from a subject to which a composition provided herein has been administered according to a specific protocol in order to determine whether or not specific immune cells cytokines antibodies etc. were reduced generated activated etc. Useful methods for detecting the presence and or number of immune cells include but are not limited to flow cytometric methods e.g. FACS and immunohistochemistry methods.

In some embodiments monitoring or assessing the generation of an undesired immune response or a tolerogenic immune response in a subject can be prior to the administration of a composition of synthetic nanocarriers provided herein and or prior to administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen. In other embodiments assessing the generation of an undesired immune response or tolerogenic immune response can be after administration of a composition of synthetic nanocarriers provided herein and or after administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen. In some embodiments the assessment is done after administration of the composition of synthetic nanocarriers but prior to administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen. In other embodiments the assessment is done after administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen but prior to administration of the composition. In still other embodiments the assessment is performed prior to both the administration of the synthetic nanocarriers and administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen while in yet other embodiments the assessment is performed after both the administration of synthetic nanocarriers and the administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen. In further embodiments the assessment is performed both prior to and after the administration of the synthetic nanocarriers and or administration of a transplantable graft or therapeutic protein or exposure to an allergen. In still other embodiments the assessment is performed more than once on the subject to determine that a desirable immune state is maintained in the subject such as a subject that has or is at risk of having an inflammatory disease an autoimmune disease an allergy organ or tissue rejection or graft versus host disease. Other subjects include those that have undergone or will undergo transplantation as well as those that have received are receiving or will receive a therapeutic protein against which they have experienced are experiencing or are expected to experience an undesired immune response.

An antibody response can be assessed by determining one or more antibody titers. Antibody titer means a measurable level of antibody production. Methods for measuring antibody titers are known in the art and include Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA . In embodiments the antibody response can be quantitated for example as the number of antibodies concentration of antibodies or titer. The values can be absolute or they can be relative. Assays for quantifying an antibody response include antibody capture assays enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs inhibition liquid phase absorption assays ILPAAs rocket immunoelectrophoresis RIE assays and line immunoelectrophoresis LIE assays. When an antibody response is compared to another antibody response the same type of quantitative value e.g. titer and method of measurement e.g. ELISA is preferably used to make the comparison.

An ELISA method for measuring an antibody titer for example a typical sandwich ELISA may consist of the following steps i preparing an ELISA plate coating material such that the antibody target of interest is coupled to a substrate polymer or other suitable material ii preparing the coating material in an aqueous solution such as PBS and delivering the coating material solution to the wells of a multiwell plate for overnight deposition of the coating onto the multiwell plate iii thoroughly washing the multiwell plate with wash buffer such as 0.05 Tween 20 in PBS to remove excess coating material iv blocking the plate for nonspecific binding by applying a diluent solution such as 10 fetal bovine serum in PBS v washing the blocking diluent solution from the plate with wash buffer vi diluting the serum sample s containing antibodies and appropriate standards positive controls with diluent as required to obtain a concentration that suitably saturates the ELISA response vii serially diluting the plasma samples on the multiwell plate such to cover a range of concentrations suitable for generating an ELISA response curve viii incubating the plate to provide for antibody target binding ix washing the plate with wash buffer to remove antibodies not bound to antigen x adding an appropriate concentration of a secondary detection antibody in same diluent such as a biotin coupled detection antibody capable of binding the primary antibody xi incubating the plate with the applied detection antibody followed by washing with wash buffer xii adding an enzyme such as streptavidin HRP horse radish peroxidase that will bind to biotin found on biotinylated antibodies and incubating xiii washing the multiwell plate xiv adding substrate s such as TMB solution to the plate xv applying a stop solution such as 2N sulfuric acid when color development is complete xvi reading optical density of the plate wells at a specific wavelength for the substrate 450 nm with subtraction of readings at 570 nm xvi applying a suitable multiparameter curve fit to the data and defining half maximal effective concentration EC50 as the concentration on the curve at which half the maximum OD value for the plate standards is achieved.

The immunosuppressants and or antigens can be coupled to the synthetic nanocarriers by any of a number of methods. Generally the coupling can be a result of bonding between the immunosuppressants and or antigens and the synthetic nanocarriers. This bonding can result in the immunosuppressants and or antigens being attached to the surface of the synthetic nanocarrierss and or contained within encapsulated the synthetic nanocarriers.

The properties of these and other polymers and methods for preparing them are well known in the art see for example U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments polymers can be linear or branched polymers. In some embodiments polymers can be dendrimers. In some embodiments polymers can be substantially cross linked to one another. In some embodiments polymers can be substantially free of cross links. In some embodiments polymers can be used in accordance with the present invention without undergoing a cross linking step. It is further to be understood that inventive synthetic nanocarriers may comprise block copolymers graft copolymers blends mixtures and or adducts of any of the foregoing and other polymers. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the polymers listed herein represent an exemplary not comprehensive list of polymers that can be of use in accordance with the present invention.

Compositions according to the invention comprise synthetic nanocarriers in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as preservatives buffers saline or phosphate buffered saline. The compositions may be made using conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing and compounding techniques to arrive at useful dosage forms. In an embodiment inventive synthetic nanocarriers are suspended in sterile saline solution for injection together with a preservative.

In embodiments when preparing synthetic nanocarriers as carriers methods for coupling components to the synthetic nanocarriers may be useful. If the component is a small molecule it may be of advantage to attach the component to a polymer prior to the assembly of the synthetic nanocarriers. In embodiments it may also be an advantage to prepare the synthetic nanocarriers with surface groups that are used to couple the components to the synthetic nanocarrier through the use of these surface groups rather than attaching the components to a polymer and then using this polymer conjugate in the construction of synthetic nanocarriers.

In certain embodiments the coupling can be a covalent linker. In embodiments peptides according to the invention can be covalently coupled to the external surface via a 1 2 3 triazole linker formed by the 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azido groups on the surface of the nanocarrier with antigen or immunosuppressant containing an alkyne group or by the 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkynes on the surface of the nanocarrier with antigens or immunosuppressants containing an azido group. Such cycloaddition reactions are preferably performed in the presence of a Cu I catalyst along with a suitable Cu I ligand and a reducing agent to reduce Cu II compound to catalytic active Cu I compound. This Cu I catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition CuAAC can also be referred as the click reaction.

Additionally the covalent coupling may comprise a covalent linker that comprises an amide linker a disulfide linker a thioether linker a hydrazone linker a hydrazide linker an imine or oxime linker an urea or thiourea linker an amidine linker an amine linker and a sulfonamide linker.

An amide linker is formed via an amide bond between an amine on one component such as the antigen or immunosuppressant with the carboxylic acid group of a second component such as the nanocarrier. The amide bond in the linker can be made using any of the conventional amide bond forming reactions with suitably protected amino acids and activated carboxylic acid such N hydroxysuccinimide activated ester.

A disulfide linker is made via the formation of a disulfide S S bond between two sulfur atoms of the form for instance of R S S R. A disulfide bond can be formed by thiol exchange of an antigen or immunosuppressant containing thiol mercaptan group SH with another activated thiol group on a polymer or nanocarrier or a nanocarrier containing thiol mercaptan groups with an antigen or immunosuppressant containing activated thiol group.

In embodiments a polymer containing an azide or alkyne group terminal to the polymer chain is prepared. This polymer is then used to prepare a synthetic nanocarrier in such a manner that a plurality of the alkyne or azide groups are positioned on the surface of that nanocarrier. Alternatively the synthetic nanocarrier can be prepared by another route and subsequently functionalized with alkyne or azide groups. The component is prepared with the presence of either an alkyne if the polymer contains an azide or an azide if the polymer contains an alkyne group. The component is then allowed to react with the nanocarrier via the 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction with or without a catalyst which covalently couples the component to the particle through the 1 4 disubstituted 1 2 3 triazole linker.

A thioether linker is made by the formation of a sulfur carbon thioether bond in the form for instance of R S R. Thioether can be made by either alkylation of a thiol mercaptan SH group on one component with an alkylating group such as halide or epoxide on a second component. Thioether linkers can also be formed by Michael addition of a thiol mercaptan group on one component to an electron deficient alkene group on a second component containing a maleimide group or vinyl sulfone group as the Michael acceptor. In another way thioether linkers can be prepared by the radical thiol ene reaction of a thiol mercaptan group on one component with an alkene group on a second component.

A hydrazone linker is made by the reaction of a hydrazide group on one component with an aldehyde ketone group on the second component.

A hydrazide linker is formed by the reaction of a hydrazine group on one component with a carboxylic acid group on the second component. Such reaction is generally performed using chemistry similar to the formation of amide bond where the carboxylic acid is activated with an activating reagent.

An imine or oxime linker is formed by the reaction of an amine or N alkoxyamine or aminooxy group on one component with an aldehyde or ketone group on the second component.

An urea or thiourea linker is prepared by the reaction of an amine group on one component with an isocyanate or thioisocyanate group on the second component. An amidine linker is prepared by the reaction of an amine group on one component with an imidoester group on the second component.

An amine linker is made by the alkylation reaction of an amine group on one component with an alkylating group such as halide epoxide or sulfonate ester group on the second component. Alternatively an amine linker can also be made by reductive amination of an amine group on one component with an aldehyde or ketone group on the second component with a suitable reducing reagent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride.

A sulfonamide linker is made by the reaction of an amine group on one component with a sulfonyl halide such as sulfonyl chloride group on the second component.

A sulfone linker is made by Michael addition of a nucleophile to a vinyl sulfone. Either the vinyl sulfone or the nucleophile may be on the surface of the nanocarrier or attached to a component.

The component can also be conjugated to the nanocarrier via non covalent conjugation methods. For example a negative charged antigen or immunosuppressant can be conjugated to a positive charged nanocarrier through electrostatic adsorption. A component containing a metal ligand can also be conjugated to a nanocarrier containing a metal complex via a metal ligand complex.

In embodiments the component can be attached to a polymer for example polylactic acid block polyethylene glycol prior to the assembly of the synthetic nanocarrier or the synthetic nanocarrier can be formed with reactive or activatible groups on its surface.

In the latter case the component may be prepared with a group which is compatible with the attachment chemistry that is presented by the synthetic nanocarriers surface. In other embodiments a peptide component can be attached to VLPs or liposomes using a suitable linker. A linker is a compound or reagent that capable of coupling two molecules together. In an embodiment the linker can be a homobifuntional or heterobifunctional reagent as described in Hermanson 2008. For example an VLP or liposome synthetic nanocarrier containing a carboxylic group on the surface can be treated with a homobifunctional linker adipic dihydrazide ADH in the presence of EDC to form the corresponding synthetic nanocarrier with the ADH linker. The resulting ADH linked synthetic nanocarrier is then conjugated with a peptide component containing an acid group via the other end of the ADH linker on NC to produce the corresponding VLP or liposome peptide conjugate.

For detailed descriptions of available conjugation methods see Hermanson G T Bioconjugate Techniques 2nd Edition Published by Academic Press Inc. 2008. In addition to covalent attachment the component can be coupled by adsorption to a pre formed synthetic nanocarrier or it can be coupled by encapsulation during the formation of the synthetic nanocarrier.

Compositions according to the invention comprise inventive synthetic nanocarriers in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The compositions may be made using conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing and compounding techniques to arrive at useful dosage forms. Techniques suitable for use in practicing the present invention may be found in Edited by Edward L. Paul Victor A. Atiemo Obeng and Suzanne M. Kresta 2004 John Wiley Sons Inc. and 2nd Ed. Edited by M. E. Auten 2001 Churchill Livingstone. In an embodiment inventive synthetic nanocarriers are suspended in sterile saline solution for injection together with a preservative.

It is to be understood that the compositions of the invention can be made in any suitable manner and the invention is in no way limited to compositions that can be produced using the methods described herein. Selection of an appropriate method may require attention to the properties of the particular moieties being associated.

In some embodiments inventive synthetic nanocarriers are manufactured under sterile conditions or are terminally sterilized. This can ensure that resulting compositions are sterile and non infectious thus improving safety when compared to non sterile compositions. This provides a valuable safety measure especially when subjects receiving synthetic nanocarriers have immune defects are suffering from infection and or are susceptible to infection. In some embodiments inventive synthetic nanocarriers may be lyophilized and stored in suspension or as lyophilized powder depending on the formulation strategy for extended periods without losing activity.

The compositions of the invention can be administered by a variety of routes including or not limited to subcutaneous intranasal oral intravenous intraperitoneal intramuscular transmucosal transmucosal sublingual rectal ophthalmic pulmonary intradermal transdermal transcutaneous or intradermal or by a combination of these routes. Routes of administration also include administration by inhalation or pulmonary aerosol.

The transplantable grafts or therapeutic proteins provided as a cell based therapy of the invention may be administered by parenteral intraarterial intranasal or intravenous administration or by injection to lymph nodes or anterior chamber of the eye or by local administration to an organ or tissue of interest. The administration may be by subcutaneous intrathecal intraventricular intramuscular intraperitoneal intracoronary intrapancreatic intrahepatic or bronchial injection.

The compositions of the invention can be administered in effective amounts such as the effective amounts described elsewhere herein. Doses of dosage forms contain varying amounts of populations of synthetic nanocarriers and or varying amounts of antigens and or immunosuppressants according to the invention. The amount of synthetic nanocarriers and or antigens and or immunosuppressants present in the inventive dosage forms can be varied according to the nature of the antigens and or immunosuppressants the therapeutic benefit to be accomplished and other such parameters. In embodiments dose ranging studies can be conducted to establish optimal therapeutic amount of the population of synthetic nanocarriers and the amount of antigens and or immunosuppressants to be present in the dosage form. In embodiments the synthetic nanocarriers and or the antigens and or immunosuppressants are present in the dosage form in an amount effective to generate a tolerogenic immune response to the antigens upon administration to a subject. It may be possible to determine amounts of the antigens and or immunosuppressants effective to generate a tolerogenic immune response using conventional dose ranging studies and techniques in subjects. Inventive dosage forms may be administered at a variety of frequencies. In a preferred embodiment at least one administration of the dosage form is sufficient to generate a pharmacologically relevant response. In more preferred embodiments at least two administrations at least three administrations or at least four administrations of the dosage form are utilized to ensure a pharmacologically relevant response.

Prophylactic administration of the inventive compositions can be initiated prior to the onset of disease disorder or condition or therapeutic administration can be initiated after a disorder disorder or condition is established.

In some embodiments administration of synthetic nanocarriers is undertaken e.g. prior to administration of a therapeutic protein transplantable graft or exposure to an allergen. In exemplary embodiments synthetic nanocarriers are administered at one or more times including but not limited to 30 25 20 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 or 0 days prior to administration of a therapeutic protein transplantable graft or exposure to an allergen. In addition or alternatively synthetic nanocarriers can be administered to a subject following administration of a therapeutic protein transplantable graft or exposure to an allergen.

In some embodiments a maintenance dose e.g. of a synthetic nanocarrier composition provided herein is administered to a subject after an initial administration has resulted in a tolerogenic response in the subject for example to maintain the tolerogenic effect achieved after the initial dose to prevent an undesired immune reaction in the subject or to prevent the subject becoming a subject at risk of experiencing an undesired immune response or an undesired level of an immune response. In some embodiments the maintenance dose is the same dose as the initial dose the subject received. In some embodiments the maintenance dose is a lower dose than the initial dose. For example in some embodiments the maintenance dose is about 3 4 about 2 3 about 1 2 about 1 3 about 1 4 about 1 8 about 1 10 about 1 20 about 1 25 about 1 50 about 1 100 about 1 1 000 about 1 10 000 about 1 100 000 or about 1 1 000 000 weight weight of the initial dose.

The compositions and methods described herein can be used to induce or enhance a tolerogenic immune response and or to suppress modulate direct or redirect an undesired immune response for the purpose of immune suppression. The compositions and methods described herein can be used in the diagnosis prophylaxis and or treatment of diseases disorders or conditions in which immune suppression e.g. tolerogenic immune response would confer a treatment benefit. Such diseases disorders or conditions include autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases allergies organ or tissue rejection and graft versus host disease. The compositions and methods described herein can also be used in subjects who have undergone or will undergo transplantation. The compositions and methods described herein can also be used in subjects who have received are receiving or will receive a therapeutic protein against which they have generated or are expected to generate an undesired immune response.

Graft versus host disease GVHD is a complication that can occur after a pluripotent cell e.g. stem cell or bone marrow transplant in which the newly transplanted material results in an attack on the transplant recipient s body. In some instances GVHD takes place after a blood transfusion. Graft versus host disease can be divided into acute and chronic forms. The acute or fulminant form of the disease aGVHD is normally observed within the first 100 days post transplant and is a major challenge to transplants owing to associated morbidity and mortality. The chronic form of graft versus host disease cGVHD normally occurs after 100 days. The appearance of moderate to severe cases of cGVHD adversely influences long term survival.

Mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticle cores are created through a sol gel process. Hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide CTAB 0.5 g is dissolved in deionized water 500 mL and then 2 M aqueous NaOH solution 3.5 mL is added to the CTAB solution. The solution is stirred for 30 min and then Tetraethoxysilane TEOS 2.5 mL is added to the solution. The resulting gel is stirred for 3 h at a temperature of 80 C. The white precipitate which forms is captured by filtration followed by washing with deionized water and drying at room temperature. The remaining surfactant is then extracted from the particles by suspension in an ethanolic solution of HCl overnight. The particles are washed with ethanol centrifuged and redispersed under ultrasonication. This wash procedure is repeated two additional times.

The SiO2 nanoparticles are then functionalized with amino groups using 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane APTMS . To do this the particles are suspended in ethanol 30 mL and APTMS 50 L is added to the suspension. The suspension is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h and then is boiled for 4 h keeping the volume constant by periodically adding ethanol. Remaining reactants are removed by five cycles of washing by centrifugation and redispersing in pure ethanol.

In a separate reaction 1 4 nm diameter gold seeds are created. All water used in this reaction is first deionized and then distilled from glass. Water 45.5 mL is added to a 100 mL round bottom flask. While stirring 0.2 M aqueous NaOH 1.5 mL is added followed by a 1 aqueous solution of tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium chloride THPC 1.0 mL . Two minutes after the addition of THPC solution a 10 mg mL aqueous solution of chloroauric acid 2 mL which has been aged at least 15 min is added. The gold seeds are purified through dialysis against water.

To form the core shell nanocarriers the amino functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles formed above are first mixed with the gold seeds for 2 h at room temperature. The gold decorated SiO2 particles are collected through centrifugation and mixed with an aqueous solution of chloroauric acid and potassium bicarbonate to form the gold shell. The particles are then washed by centrifugation and redispersed in water. Ibuprofen is loaded by suspending the particles in a solution of sodium ibuprofen 1 mg L for 72 h. Free ibuprofen is then washed from the particles by centrifugation and redispersing in water.

The liposomes are formed using thin film hydration. 1 2 Dipalmitoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine DPPC 32 mol cholesterol 32 mol and cyclosporin A 6.4 mol are dissolved in pure chloroform 3 mL . This lipid solution is added to a 50 mL round bottom flask and the solvent is evaporated on a rotary evaporator at a temperature of 60 C. The flask is then flushed with nitrogen gas to remove remaining solvent. Phosphate buffered saline 2 mL and five glass beads are added to the flask and the lipid film is hydrated by shaking at 60 C. for 1 h to form a suspension. The suspension is transferred to a small pressure tube and sonicated at 60 C. for four cycles of 30 s pulses with a 30 s delay between each pulse. The suspension is then left undisturbed at room temperature for 2 h to allow for complete hydration. The liposomes are washed by centrifugation followed by resuspension in fresh phosphate buffered saline.

The assay included the use of OTII mice which have a transgenic T cell receptor specific for an immune dominant ovalbumin peptide 323 339 . In order to create antigen specific tDCs CD11csplenocytes were isolated and the ovalbumin peptide 323 339 added in vitro at 1 g ml or no antigen. Soluble or nanocarrier encapsulated rapamycin was then added to the DCs for 2 hours which were then washed extensively to remove free rapamycin from the culture. Purified responder CD4CD25cells were isolated from OTII mice and added to tDC at a 10 1 T to DC ratio. The mixture of tDC and OTII T cells were then cultured for 4 5 days and the frequency of Treg cells CD4CD25highFoxP3 were analyzed by flow cytometry as shown in . Regions were selected based on isotype controls.

Measurement of synthetic nanocarrier dimensions was obtained by dynamic light scattering DLS . A suspension of the synthetic nanocarriers was diluted with purified water to achieve a final synthetic nanocarrier suspension concentration of approximately 0.01 to 0.1 mg mL. The diluted suspension was prepared directly inside a suitable cuvette for DLS analysis. The cuvette was then placed in a Brookhaven Instruments Corp. ZetaPALS allowed to equilibrate to 25 C. and then scanned for sufficient time to acquire a stable and reproducible distribution based on appropriate inputs for viscosity of the medium and refractive indicies of the sample. The effective diameter or mean of the distribution was then reported.

For proof of concept experiments the tolerance inducing drug rapamycin was used in combination with the class II binding ovalbumin peptide 323 339. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant used to suppress allogeneic transplantation rejection and is an inhibitor of mTOR which is a regulator of several cellular functions including APC and T cell behavior. The synthetic nanocarriers were prepared according to the above representative examples of which are described in more detail in the following tables Tables 2 4 .

The results from a representative flow cytometric analysis show an increase in the number of CD4CD25highFoxP3cells when DCs were treated with free rapamycin and free Ovalbumin 323 339 .

Free rapamycin or synthetic nanocarriers containing rapamycin were combined with free soluble Ovalbumin 323 339 to evaluate induction of tDC . It was found that nanocarriers containing rapamycin combined with free ovalbumin 323 339 induces Treg development. Briefly antigen specific tDC were obtained by isolating dendritic cells CD11csplenocytes and culturing them in combination with the Ovalbumin 323 339 peptide plus soluble or nanocarrier encapsulated rapamycin Synthetic Nanocarrier s 13 14 15 and 16 for 2 hours followed by extensive washing. Purified responder CD4CD25cells were isolated from OTII mice and added to the tDC. The mixture of tDC and OTII T cells were then cultured for 4 5 days and the frequency of Treg cells CD4CD25highFoxP3 were analyzed by flow cytometry. The data show a dose dependent increase in CD4CD25highFoxP3for both free rapamycin and nanocarrier encapsulated rapamycin suggesting induction of Treg by rapamycin nanocarrier treated DC.

Various nanocarrier compositions were used to evaluate induction of tDC and the induction of Treg was demonstrated. It was found that nanocarriers with co encapsulated rapamycin and Ovalbumin 323 339 peptide resulted in higher induction of FoxP3 expressing cells 6.5 than either unstimulated 1.3 or rapamycin alone 2.7 . Interestingly two separate nanocarrier compositions containing rapamycin alone Synthetic Nanocarrier s 7 and 8 demonstrated superior induction of FoxP3 expressing cells 22.4 and 27.2 respectively when combined with a population of synthetic nanocarriers containing Ovalbumin 323 339 as compared to an admixture with free Ovalbumin 323 339 peptide 12.7 and 17.7 respectively . Overall the data show an increase in CD4CD25highFoxP3when using nanocarrier encapsulated rapamycin with superior responses seen with either co encapsulated Ovalbumin 323 339 peptide or with admixed Ovalbumin 323 339 peptide containing nanocarrier.

A composition of the invention is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline PBS and injected into female Lewis rats intramuscularly in 0.1 0.2 ml containing 500 g of the composition. A control group of rats receives 0.1 0.2 ml of PBS. Nine to ten days after the injection spleen and lymph nodes are harvested from the rats and single cell suspensions obtained by macerating tissues through a 40 m nylon cell strainer. Samples are stained in PBS 1 FCS with the appropriate dilution of relevant monoclonal antibodies. Propidum iodide staining cells are excluded from analysis. Samples are acquired on an LSR2 flow cytometer BD Biosciences USA and analyzed using FACS Diva software. The expression of markers CD4 CD25high and FoxP3 is analyzed on the cells. The presence of CD4CD25highFoxP3cells suggests an induction of CD4 Treg cells.

Balb c mice are immunized with an APC presentable antigen in incomplete Freunds adjuvant to induce T cell proliferation e.g. CD4T cell the level of which is assessed. Subsequently a composition of the invention comprising the APC presentable antigen and an immunosuppressant is administered subcutaneously in a dose dependent manner. The same mice are then again exposed to the APC presentable antigen and the level of T cell proliferation is again assessed. Changes in the T cell population are then monitored with a reduction in T cell proliferation upon subsequent challenge with the APC presentable antigen indicating a tolerogenic immune response.

Mice were designated to groups that received PBS alone sol aGC solRAPA sol aGC NP RAPA. Mice were injected at 9 am and at 9.30 AM received BrefeldinA i.v. to prevent release of intracellular cytokines produced. At 1 pm mice were sacrificed and the liver was perfused with PBS and processed to obtain a single cell suspension enriched for lymphocytes. Cells were stained with cell surface markers for iNKT cells agc loaded CD1d tetramers and T cells receptor TCRb and activation marker CD69. Cells were acquired on a FacsCanto flow cytometer and analyzed on by FlowJo.

iNKT cells from mice that received aGC were activated as seen by cytokine production and up regulation of CD69 on their surface. Both soluble and nanocarrier Rapamycin caused a significant decrease in surface levels of CD69 on iNKT cells suggesting the cells were less activated following treatment compared to PBS treatment control. The results are shown in .

Mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticle cores are created through a sol gel process. Hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide CTAB 0.5 g is dissolved in deionized water 500 mL and then 2 M aqueous NaOH solution 3.5 mL is added to the CTAB solution. The solution is stirred for 30 min and then Tetraethoxysilane TEOS 2.5 mL is added to the solution. The resulting gel is stirred for 3 h at a temperature of 80 C. The white precipitate which forms is captured by filtration followed by washing with deionized water and drying at room temperature. The remaining surfactant is then extracted from the particles by suspension in an ethanolic solution of HCl overnight. The particles are washed with ethanol centrifuged and redispersed under ultrasonication. This wash procedure is repeated two additional times.

The SiO2 nanoparticles are then functionalized with amino groups using 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane APTMS . To do this the particles are suspended in ethanol 30 mL and APTMS 50 L is added to the suspension. The suspension is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h and then is boiled for 4 h keeping the volume constant by periodically adding ethanol. Remaining reactants are removed by five cycles of washing by centrifugation and redispersing in pure ethanol.

In a separate reaction 1 4 nm diameter gold seeds are created. All water used in this reaction is first deionized and then distilled from glass. Water 45.5 mL is added to a 100 mL round bottom flask. While stirring 0.2 M aqueous NaOH 1.5 mL is added followed by a 1 aqueous solution of tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium chloride THPC 1.0 mL . Two minutes after the addition of THPC solution a 10 mg mL aqueous solution of chloroauric acid 2 mL which has been aged at least 15 min is added. The gold seeds are purified through dialysis against water.

To form the core shell nanocarriers the amino functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles formed above are first mixed with the gold seeds for 2 h at room temperature. The gold decorated SiO2 particles are collected through centrifugation and mixed with an aqueous solution of chloroauric acid and potassium bicarbonate to form the gold shell. The particles are then washed by centrifugation and redispersed in water. Thiolated Ovalbumin made by treating Ovalbumin with 2 iminothiolane hydrochloride is loaded by suspending the particles in a solution of thiolated Ovalbumin 1 mg L for 72 h. The particles is then pellet washed with 1 PBS pH 7.4 to remove free protein. The resulting silica gold core shell nanocarriers containing Ovalbumin are then re suspended in 1 PBS for further analysis and assays.

The liposomes are formed by thin film hydration. 1 2 Dipalmitoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine DPPC 32 mol cholesterol 32 mol and rapamycin 6.4 mol are dissolved in pure chloroform 3 mL . This lipid solution is added to a 10 mL glass tube and the solvent is removed under nitrogen gas stream and desiccated for 6 hr. under vacuum. Multilamellar vesicles are obtained by hydration of the film with 2.0 ml of 25 mM MOPS buffer pH 8.5 containing excess amount of Ovalbumin. The tube is vortexed until the lipid film is peeled of from the tube surface. To break the multilamellar vesicles into monolamellar ten cycles of freezing liquid nitrogen and thawing 30 C. water bath are applied. The sample is then diluted to 1 ml in 25 mM MOPS buffer pH 8.5. Size of the resulting liposome is homogenized by extrusion by passing the sample 10 fold through a 200 nm pore polycarbonate filters. The resulting liposomes are then used for further analysis and bioassays.

L PAE 4.7 mmol and EDC.HCl 4.7 mmol are added to the solution and stirred for 30 min at 4 C. The solution is then maintained at room temperature with stirring for 24 h. Low molecular weight chemicals are removed by dialysis using dialysis membrane with MWCO 50 kD. The resulting PGA graft L PAE is obtained by freeze drying.

Step 2. Preparation of nanoparticles from PGA graft L PAE polymer Nanoparticles composed of PGA graft L PAE are prepared by a precipitation and dialysis method. PGA graft L PAE 20 mg was dissolved in 2 ml of DMSO followed by addition of 2 mL of water to form a translucent solution. The solution is then dialyzed against distilled water using cellulose membrane tubing 50 000 MWCO to form the nanoparticles and to remove the organic solvents for 72 h at room temperature. The distilled water is exchanged at intervals of 12 h. The resulting nanoparticle solution 10 mg mL in water is then used for antigen conjugation.

Step 3. Ovalbumin conjugation to PGA nanoparticles Surface carboxylic acid groups of the PGA nanoparticles 10 mg ml are first activated by EDC and NHS 10 mg mL each in phosphate buffer pH 5.8 for 2 h at ambient temperature. After pellet washing to remove excess EDC NHS the activated nanoparticles are mixed with 1 mL of Ovalbumin 10 mg ml in phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.4 and the mixture is incubated at 4 8 C for 24 h. The resulting Ovalbumin conjugated PGA nanoparticles are washed twice with PBS and resuspended at 5 mg mL in PBS for further analysis and bioassays.

To prepare the EPO encapsulated PGA nanoparticles 0.25 4 mg of EPO is dissolved in 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4 and 1 mL of the PGA graft L PAE 10 mg mL in DMSO is added to the EPO solution. The resulting solution is centrifuged at 14 000 g for 15 min and repeatedly rinsed with PBS. The resulting EPO encapsulated PGA nanoparticles are then resuspended in PBS 5 mg mL for further analysis and bioassay.

Step 1. Formation of Gold NCs AuNCs An aq. solution of 500 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 is heated to reflux for 10 min with vigorous stirring in a 1 L round bottom flask equipped with a condenser. A solution of 50 mL of 40 mM of trisodium citrate is then rapidly added to the stirring solution. The resulting deep wine red solution is kept at reflux for 25 30 min and the heat is withdrawn and the solution is cooled to room temperature. The solution is then filtered through a 0.8 m membrane filter to give the AuNCs solution. The AuNCs are characterized using visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The AuNCs are ca. 20 nm diameter capped by citrate with peak absorption at 520 nm.

Step 2. Conjugation of Ovalbumin to AuNCs A solution of 150 l of thiolated Ovalbumin 10 M in 10 mM pH 9.0 carbonate buffer is added to 1 mL of 20 nm diameter citrate capped gold nanocarriers 1.16 nM to produce a molar ratio of thiol to gold of 2500 1. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under argon for 1 hour to allow complete exchange of thiol with citrate on the gold nanocarriers. The AuNCs with Ovalbumin on the surface is then purified by centrifuge at 12 000 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant is decanted and the pellet containing AuNC Ovalbumin is then pellet washed with 1 PBS buffer.
