The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 524 035 filed on Aug. 16 2011.

The present invention generally relates to asset management and tracking and more specifically to applications and systems for management and tracking of telecommunication equipment in a data center.

A data center is a facility used to house a network of computer systems and associated components such as telecommunications and storage systems. In addition to that equipment the data center may include redundant or backup power supplies redundant data communications connections environmental controls e.g. air conditioning fire suppression and security devices. Typically the data center is managed by a data center manager DCM who may need to add move or decommission expensive data equipment on an hourly daily weekly basis. The highly dynamic environment of the data center routinely may cause personnel scheduling issues lost asset issues and service outages. Therefore it would be desirable to alleviate the issues caused by the highly dynamic environment of the data center and to simplify the workflow for the DCM.

Accordingly the present invention may help to assist the DCM with a highly dynamic environment of the data center and to simplify the workflow

In one embodiment the present invention is an asset tracking system which includes the integration of an Infrastructure Management Software IMS such as Panduit s Physical Infrastructure Manager a task manager and a virtual container or virtual container feature. An IMS is a generally a software application that can facilitate the recording tracking and management of data center equipment.

In another embodiment the present invention can give the DCM the ability to track the whereabouts of equipment in the network along with equipment s connectivity to that network. The virtual container can allow the DCM to graphically represent the network equipment in a way that is desirable to the DCM. The graphical representation provided by the virtual container could provide a representation of the network equipment for example by location by equipment type and or by product line.

In another embodiment when the IMS the task manager and the virtual container are combined into an integrated system for data center management the system of the present invention can provide the DCM the ability to schedule when network equipment is added moved removed and also identify where the equipment will be located how it will be connected or disconnected from the network and or who will do the work.

In another embodiment the present invention includes asset tracking reconciliation which gives the DCM the ability to accept or reject changes made to the trackable assets by technicians. Through reconciliation the DCM is given the means to verify that the work is done properly and the DCM is also given the opportunity to approve or reject the work. If the DCM accepts the change made by the technician the asset information is changed in an IMS database. If the DCM rejects the change the asset information remains as unchanged.

A system according to the present invention may provide the DCM with real time knowledge of where data center equipment is located and if or when the equipment is being worked on. Additionally the present invention may provide the DCM with the ability to track the whereabouts of each piece of equipment in the network and within the data center along with each piece of equipment s connectivity to the rest of the network.

As used herein the term asset tracking refers to the awareness of the physical location of an individual device. Asset tracking does not necessarily imply asset management thought the two terms may be used interchangeably. Assets may be any piece of equipment found in a data center including but not limited to network equipment such as cabling switches routers patch panels computer systems communications devices power supplies and modems and infrastructure such as cabinets racks cable ties communications outlets and power outlets.

The tracking system of the present invention can allow a user to select specify and track attributes related to automatically discovered assets through IMS discovery and manually discovered assets. An asset is considered to be automatically discovered if the asset is classified as an on network asset and the asset has been present while a network discovery process was running. The tracking system becomes aware of this class of asset through active actions e.g. IMS network discovery mechanism manual or scheduled . An asset is considered manually discovered if the awareness of the asset can only be determined when a technician communicates status changes to the tracking system. The tracking system becomes aware of this class of assets through external means e.g. data entry via a data entry device . The asset tracking process may also be semi automated requiring a user to manually enter attribute information manually validate asset location and establish connectivity. In addition the asset tracking process supports the use of data entry device s that allow a user to detect and read asset identifying information such as asset tags to reduce data entry time and improve accuracy. Data entry devices may include any device through which information can be captured or input such as RFID radio frequency identification readers bar code readers keyboards mice scanners and or cameras. Once initial validations are complete the tracking system will track automatically discovered asset movement across the network including all asset information previously specified. A process using policy enforcement and data entry devices supports semi automatically tracking manually discovered asset movement.

A tracking system according to the present invention may include an Asset Tracking 2.0 Policy which introduces an additional method or tagging system that incorporates ID tags e.g. barcode or RFID and data entry devices e.g. barcode scanners or RFID scanners to discover and track assets throughout their life cycle within the data center. This tagging system allows for the formation of reliable and unique association between asset data and physical objects associated with the asset data. Using appropriate data entry devices a tagged asset can be accurately identified added to the tracking system and tracked without requiring network connection. As a result even if an asset is not attached to or connected with the network certain key asset data can still be gathered and presented to the tracking system of the present invention. The tagging system allows for the addition of assets and the detection of discrepancy between the asset data and the physical object for non networking assets. This tagging system expands the scope and categories of assets that may be tracked by the tracking system. In addition the tagging system enables DCMs to inventory assets at the earliest opportunity e.g. upon initial possession of assets . The tagging system also supports the capabilities to flag discrepancies between the asset data and device data which is data generated by a data entry device when reading an ID tag and to provide a function to guide authorized personnel to reconcile any discrepancies. Authentications and authorizations are also supported by the tracking system of the present invention to insure that asset activities are properly conducted by the authorized personnel. The Asset Tracking 2.0 Policy does not stipulate fixed procedures upon users. Rather the Asset Tracking 2.0 Policy offers a set of configurable facilities with which users may use to form policies that meet their own practices and needs in adding and tracking assets.

The workflow of a system according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in . A DCM or any other user employs data entry devices to collect asset tracking AT data. This data is collected by an asset tracking data collector which at least in part facilitates the transfer of said data to the IMS. The data collector may include both software and hardware aspects. The data is then received by a pre processor which formats the collected data in preparation for placing it into a message service queue . From this queue an asset tracking data processor evaluates the queued data and forwards it to the event processor along with an IMS database . When data is received by an even processor it is then formatted and outputted on a graphical user interface GUI an example of which is illustrated in . At the same time the asset reconciliation processor checks the database against an event and if a conflict arises the processor forwards corresponding data to the event processor to be made visible through the GUI .

With reference to when data gathered about off network or on network devices such as the data entry device is in conflict with the data in the tracking system reconciliation of an asset record must occur. In order to reconcile an asset record the following preconditions and events preferably take place 1 reconciliation is a manual process performed by the data center manager 2 reconciliation may be initiated at the GUI for the tracking system or at the data entry device 3 the reported device data is found to have the following problems but is not limited to a one or more not all of MAC address asset number EPC or barcode mismatch data in the system doesn t match the reported MAC asset number EPC or barcode . Examples of records to be reconciled include for a server with two NICs network interface cards existing system data lists one MAC data entry device lists other MAC b a duplicate MAC asset number EPC electronic product code or barcode another device in the system has the same reported MAC asset number EPC or barcode c the location in the system doesn t match the reported location for the same device or the device is missing in the system d a duplicate location for example another device in the system already occupies the reported location and e in a link up report from the switches the reported device is found in the system 4 the technician is logged in with credentials that allows all users will not have permission to perform reconciliation reconciliation on server or data entry device .

The events for reconciliation of an asset record in the tracking system preferably occur in the following sequence 1 the tracking system or the data entry device logs the conflict and raises a security alert e.g. generates a notification 2 on the tracking system GUI e.g. location tree or the data entry device the asset with security alert is marked with special visibility for attention indicating reconciliation is needed 3 the technician selects the asset to be reconciled 4 the technician is prompted for one of the following options by the system GUI or data entry device e.g. on a drop down menu a edit the data field or selectively accept the conflicted data the technician selects the data desired to be accepted or b accept new data for the device as is the new device data will replace the existing device data .

If option a is selected the technician may manually edit additional data fields the technician completes the change the technician instructs the system or data entry device to accept the edited accepted data the reconciliation is complete and the security alert is cleared and the asset returns to normal visibility within the tracking system. If option b is selected the reconciliation is complete and the security alert is cleared and the device returns to normal visibility.

A third option option c is also possible which is to reject and not accept the reported data the existing device data is kept in the system and the reported data is discarded . If option c is selected the reconciliation is complete the security alert is cleared and the device returns to normal visibility. A fourth option option d is to defer where the security alert is to be resolved by action other than manipulating the device data and existing device data is kept in the system. Under option d reconciliation is still required the device is still in security alert and action other than manipulating the device data is required to complete the reconciliation. For example a physical move of the device may be required to correct the problem.

After selecting an option in step 4 the sequence moves to step 5 whereby any actions taken by technician are logged into the tracking system or the data entry device e.g. the selected option the person performing the reconciliation and timestamps .

In order to audit a specified location and verify expected inventory vs. actual inventory e.g. for a SOx Sarbanes Oxley audit the following preconditions and events preferably take place 1 the tracking system has a list of known assets 2 a report interface exists to generate reports by location room rack etc. 3 the report interface can print out the asset number and barcode number in barcode format 4 at least one report is generated per location 5 the report can be generated via paper or sent to the data entry device or displayed on the GUI of the tracking system.

The events for auditing a specified location and verifying expected inventory vs. actual inventory preferably occur in the following sequence 1 a report is generated that creates a location targeted listing a room or a rack for example 2 the report has an ID that can be scanned e.g. bar code for the asset number the room and the location 3 the technician enters the room with proper credential 4 the technician signs in on to the data entry device with credentials and the credentials are accepted 5 the technician selects the room location with the data entry device 6 the technician verifies that the technician is in the proper room 7 the technician scans an asset tag and a barcode from the report that defines the location 8 the technician scans preferably all assets associated with that location 9 the technician indicates to the data entry device that all assets have been scanned 10 actions taken by technician are logged into the system or data entry device e.g. the selected option the person performing the reconciliation and timestamps and 11 the technician closes out the transaction on the data entry device.

With reference to the virtual container feature provides the DCM with the ability to graphically represent the network equipment in a way that is desirable to the DCM. The graphical representation provided by the virtual container feature can provide a representation of the network equipment for example by location by equipment type or by product line.

Data center managers and data center designers often refer to the assets in the data center in terms of their functional logical or physical grouping in the data center. The virtual container feature is targeted at that behavior. Within an IMS assets may be referred to as managed items which are items that are being managed by an IMS and are shown on a location tree. Managed items may include devices such as switches Panduit s PViQ panels POUs power outlet units DPEs power over Ethernet panels computers other endpoints and containers such as racks as well as virtual chassis may all be managed items under an IMS. Assets known by the tracking system can be members of multiple virtual containers such as POD 13 Container 12 Accounting Server group 3 and Development Servers. The concept of a virtual container is a collection of customer defined items. The concept is defined such that a virtual container can contain other virtual containers. Also a virtual chassis is defined as a virtual container under the physical network location tree that is intended to group related devices belonging to a Multi NIC server blade chassis server or switch. The virtual container leads to many useful applications when combined with a virtualization visualization system and the tracking system the virtual container is capable of determining power aggregation per application. Virtualization visualization gives a user the ability to visually model a network based on virtual containers. For example there could be a diagram of all of the accounting department s servers in the network based on a virtual container. Also the virtual container is able to set boundaries and rules for application accessibility running in a cloud computing environment. A cloud computing environment enables ubiquitous convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Boundaries such as geographical or security based boundaries may be enforced on an application for example.

Preferably the virtual container allows static and dynamic power aggregation per application when combined with a virtualization visualization system and the tracking system. This power aggregation functionality may enable enterprises to monitor the power usage of different departments. An example of such departments is illustrated in showing marketing engineering finance human resource not shown or research and development not shown . For instance all the above mentioned departments may have servers in any cabinet within a data center. By using the virtual container a user can group all the marketing servers together all the engineering servers together all the finance servers together and the same thing can be done to group other servers per department. Once this happens with the help of the tracking system a user can statically monitor the power usage by all or some of a particular group of servers such as all of the marketing servers with more ease. Furthermore a user may also dynamically monitor the power usage by combining the virtual container with virtualization visualization. Virtualization visualization is able to dynamically track applications running by a certain department such as the marketing department . When applications running from a certain department such as the marketing department interact with other departments virtualization visualization is able to track them down and provide an accurate power per application data which can be generated dynamically.

The virtual container may enable the monitoring of VMware which is virtualization software for desktops manufactured by VMware of Palo Alto Calif. The virtual container may track software based applications. The virtual container can show the user where an instance of an Oracle Database is running e.g. on a server in another city and provide and display how much processing power and memory is being consumed by that software for example. For instance a user can track how many instances of a certain type of software such as Oracle Database software is running and the user may also obtain the location of where the each instance of a certain type of software is running at. For example virtual containers may be used to track all Microsoft Outlook applications in the network or how much memory is consumed by Microsoft Outlook for the accounting team etc.

With reference to the virtual container may provide boundary and rules pertaining to application security when running in a cloud computing environment known simply as a cloud. A user may create a custom boundary and rules to limit the traveling of an application. For instance certain applications may be in a top secret or high level and a user may use the virtual container to keep those applications on only certain approved servers. Applications may also be prevented from migrating to computing resources in particular locations.

Managed items may easily be dragged and dropped into a virtual container or chassis. Any time a managed item is dragged into a virtual container or chassis the presence of the managed item under the network physical location tree should be left intact. Likewise these managed items can also be copied or cut from a virtual location and be pasted onto another virtual location.

With reference to two virtual containers are shown created under a root virtual container node. As an example the two virtual containers are named My Virtual Container and My Virtual Container 1 . Under My Virtual Container there are assets being grouped together. This illustrates one of the main functions of a virtual container to group assets into a user defined virtual container. Under My Virtual Container 1 there are two virtual containers named My Virtual Container 2 and My Virtual Container 3 which belongs to My Virtual Container 2. From this example we can see that a virtual container is capable of grouping virtual containers within a virtual container. When a virtual container is selected or the assets within a virtual container are selected a panel on the right hand side will display any appropriate information.

With reference to the hierarchy of a blade server virtual chassis is displayed as Server Virtual Chassis Blade Server Ports . A validation may be done to check what types the source and target devices are e.g. switch and network capable devices. If the validation fails then the user will be shown an error message. If the validation is successful then the user will be shown a dialog box with an option to create a Multi NIC device or a virtual chassis. If the user selects the virtual chassis option a text box for entering the virtual chassis name will be displayed. If the user selects Cancel nothing will happen. If user selects OK then a new virtual chassis will be created and the source and target device would be shown under the newly created virtual chassis. When the user opens the connectivity for the virtual chassis the connectivity view shows the ports for the underlying devices.

With reference to a structure of a blade switch virtual chassis is displayed as Switch Chassis Blade Ports . When a user selects a virtual chassis the chassis detail is displayed on the right hand pane . Similarly when the user selects a switch blade under the virtual chassis any blade details will be displayed on the right hand pane .

With reference to a validation may be done to check if source and target devices are e.g. switch and network capable devices for example. If the validation fails then the user will be shown an error message. If the validation is successful then the user will be shown a dialog box with an option to create a Multi NIC device or a virtual chassis. If the user selects the Multi NIC option and selects the OK button a new port will be created for the target device with the IP and MAC of the source device. displays the port details of a highlighted device.

With reference to one can observe the relationship between a virtual host and a virtual machine. For example when viewing one can observe that Virtual Machine belongs to Virtual Host in rack and likewise Virtual Machine belongs to Virtual Host in rack . Each virtual machine is associated with a virtual host and is represented as a child node of the virtual host.

With reference to the IMS in the case of the illustrations the IMS is Panduit s PIM task manager provides the DCM with the ability to view a work order task and to add subtasks to accomplish the work order task. DCMs routinely create and assign work order tasks to technicians to carry out the day to day operations of the data center. These tasks are typically include but are not limited to installing and removing equipment or assets such as switches routers and servers from data center racks and cabinets. To simplify technician assignments and track the task from start to finish DCM s use a third party work order application designed to do so. Examples of third party work order systems include BMC Remedy by BMC and Ground Zero Tech Works Inc. by Ayallova.

The IMS Task Manager ITM feature provides the DCM the ability to view the work order tasks and to add subtasks to accomplish the work order task. The subtasks can be manual events that must be carried out or they can be IMS related tasks that use existing IMS features like a Device Catalog Infrastructure Manager and Connectivity Creation Screens available in Panduit s PIM software to create detailed tasks that can be carried out by technicians or by an IMS automatically.

The ITM consists of three pieces a third party work order system an IMS and an API application programming interface to connect the two. The third party work order system serves as the engine for creating and processing work orders. When a task on a work order is identified as an IMS related task the task will be sent to the IMS using API calls for Data Center Manager and Network Engineer input. When a new work order task is received from the third party work order system the IMS will store the task for processing adding a timestamp. The DCM may then process the task within the IMS creating any subtasks that are required at the IMS level. When finished the updated task will be exported back to the third party work order system which will add the subtasks into the work order. The IMS will then track the progress of the automatic subtasks and notify the third party work order system when a task is complete.

In one embodiment only network connections will be processed by the IMS and a notification will be sent to the third party work order system. All other status updates will come down from the third party work order system.

One primary method for accessing and provisioning the tasks will be handled by a link on the third party work order system. This link will open an IMS client and take the user to a ITM landing page. This landing page will display the work orders for that user and will allow the provisioning of tasks for the work orders. The IMS allows a user to save a device location or connection connect disconnect to a task. The necessary information required to do the task will be placed in the task.

The ITM displays a main page which provides links to a device catalog an infrastructure manager and a connectivity creation page allowing for easy access to areas for finding devices locations and connections. The selected device information location and connection information may be added into a task that is being configured when the user saves the selection to the task.

As a result the IMS seamlessly integrates with the 3rd party system that is it appears to be a part of the 3rd party work order system when using the 3rd party work order system . Additionally the ITM allows extension and enhancement of the 3rd party functionality in a unique manner. The IMS provides the ability to define connectivity RU Reservation POU outlet reservation and asset tagging work order subtasks. As the subtasks are defined using IMS features they are transferred to a ITM holding container module. Once subtasks are encapsulated in the ITM holding container module they can be reordered deleted added modified as a part of the overall work order within the 3rd party work order system. Work orders are normally initiated from the 3rd party work order system however the IMS can have the capability of initiating a work order and transfer that set of tasks subtasks to the 3rd party system.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware or software is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and or systems and or other technologies described herein can be effected e.g. hardware software and or firmware and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and or systems and or other technologies are deployed. For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle alternatively if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware. Hence there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and or devices and or other technologies described herein may be effected none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns e.g. speed flexibility or predictability of the implementer any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically oriented hardware software and or firmware.

The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and or processes via the use of block diagrams flowcharts and or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams flowcharts and or examples contain one or more functions and or operations it will be understood by those within the art that each function and or operation within such block diagrams flowcharts or examples can be implemented individually and or collectively by a wide range of hardware software firmware or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs digital signal processors DSPs or other integrated formats. However those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein in whole or in part can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems as one or more programs running on one or more processors e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors as firmware or as virtually any combination thereof and that designing the circuitry and or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include but are not limited to the following a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk a hard disk drive a Compact Disc CD a Digital Video Disk DVD a digital tape a computer memory etc. and a transmission type medium such as a digital and or an analog communication medium e.g. a fiber optic cable a waveguide a wired communications link a wireless communication link etc. 

The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within or connected with different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively associated such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as associated with each other such that the desired functionality is achieved irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise any two components so associated can also be viewed as being operably connected or operably coupled to each other to achieve the desired functionality and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being operably couplable to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and or physically interacting components and or wirelessly interactable and or wirelessly interacting components and or logically interacting and or logically interactable components.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to implement devices and or processes and or systems in the fashion s set forth herein and thereafter use engineering and or business practices to integrate such implemented devices and or processes and or systems into more comprehensive devices and or processes and or systems. That is at least a portion of the devices and or processes and or systems described herein can be integrated into comprehensive devices and or processes and or systems via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that examples of such comprehensive devices and or processes and or systems might include as appropriate to context and application all or part of devices and or processes and or systems of a an air conveyance e.g. an airplane rocket hovercraft helicopter etc. b a ground conveyance e.g. a car truck locomotive tank armored personnel carrier etc. c a building e.g. a home warehouse office etc. d an appliance e.g. a refrigerator a washing machine a dryer etc. e a communications system e.g. a networked system a telephone system a Voice over IP system etc. f a business entity e.g. an Internet Service Provider ISP entity such as Comcast Cable Quest Southwestern Bell etc. or g a wired wireless services entity such as Sprint Cingular Nextel etc. etc.
