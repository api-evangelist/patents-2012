The performance items module is configured for receiving storing retrieving and updating a plurality of performance items generated by the microlearning performance management module during each unique microlearning performance by the plurality of learning users in learning user database .

The activity items database is configured for receiving storing and updating a plurality of activity items generated by the activity monitoring module for each unique user activity for each unique user on the modular learning system . Thus the activity items database stores actions taken by users on the modular learning system other than purchase and performance of learning applications. These activity items are used to generate notifications to users. Therefore the database of activity items includes items reflecting the performance purchase and the unique user activities performed on the modular learning system. These activities may include for example a new learning application added to the system a revision to a learning application made by an authoring user scheduling or canceling a performance of a learning application and other interactions on the modular learning system . The stored activity items include the activity and any users associated with the action such as the user initiating the action and any users affected by the action. Moreover when a new activity item is placed in the database of activity items user update preferences provide a notification to a user responding to it.

The dynamic updation module is configured for receiving storing retrieving and updating dynamic user preferences of the viewing user. In some embodiments the module is involved in accessing user update preferences associated with the viewing user. In some embodiments the viewing user may prefer notifications to be updated with the latest purchase activity performance activity and other activities after predetermined intervals of time while another viewing user may prefer the notifications to be generated and displayed as soon as the purchase activity performance activity and other activities occur on or through the modular learning system . The dynamic updation module is accessed by the notification items module to determine the frequency and intervals of notifications generation and by the notification interface generator to determine the frequency and intervals of display of notifications through an interface on the viewing user s user device .

The role validation module is configured for validating the viewing user s user role to determine the kind and interface of notification items to be generated by module for the viewing user. The said module being responsive to validating the user role accesses the database of activity items and retrieving activity items that include the user role in the set of user roles permitted to access the activity item. For example a viewing user whose role is validated by module as that of a learning user by accessing the user database and user role preference module may only access the kind and interface of notification items generated for a learning user role through an interface generated by generator and displayed on the viewing user s user device . The kind and interface of the notification items relevant to the tutoring user for the same activity e.g. the same learning application performance may not be generated by notification items module or displayed by generator to the viewing user who is validated as a learning user.

The notification items module is configured for generating storing retrieving and updating a plurality of notification items for the preferred user role of each unique user on the modular learning system by accessing purchase items from purchase items module performance items from performance items module retrieved activity items from activity items database . In some embodiments a plurality of notification items may be generated and stored for future access by the notification interface generator for each unique user in a preferred user role.

The user role preference module is configured for receiving storing and retrieving the kind and interface of notification items to be displayed to a viewing user in each of the various learning user roles. In some embodiments the notification preferences are updated for some or all of the user roles by modular learning system . In other embodiments the user role notification preferences are considered as default preferences of the viewing user with each unique viewing user in a user role being granted access to modify personalize or update their particular user role s notification preferences through a notifications settings interface generated by the notification interface generator and displayed on the viewing user s user device . The user role preference module is accessed by the notification items module to generate notification items relevant to the user role of the viewing user. The user role preference module is accessed by the role validation module to validate that a requesting user s user role is the same as the user role for which the notifications are being generated.

The user database is configured for temporarily receiving storing retrieving and updating identity items of each of a plurality of kinds of users already stored in the user database along with tutor database . These kinds of users can comprise learning application authoring users independent learning facility administering users learning tools supplying users learning visit organizing users learning application translating users learning application certifying users learning application template developing users learning workshop organizing users recruiting users learning facility administering users and other users of the modular learning system .

The activity monitoring module is configured for monitoring a plurality of activities conducted on or through the modular learning system between each of a plurality of kinds of users on the modular learning system . The activity monitoring module identifies and stores the activities in the activity items database . In various embodiments the activities could include but not limited to new applications performed monitored reviewed funded scored published translated certified purchased sold edited as well as learning facilities set up accessed booked tutoring services learning facility access learning events access purchased and sold user profiles updated with new identity items purchase compatibility or performance compatibility among other activities. Although the activity items database is described as being composed of a plurality of activity fewer or more user activities e.g. New Learning Infrastructure Set Up For Compatible Learning Applications at a Learning Facility may comprise the module with the present invention still falling within the scope of various embodiments. In some embodiments the user role preferences for each viewing user s user role in user role preference module allow for access to the viewing user of notifications relating to activities conducted by a predetermined subset of related user roles. For example the user role preferences of a viewing funding user may allow for access to notifications of performance activity conducted by learning users being funded by the funding user. In some embodiments the activities may not involve the activities like purchase and sale of microlearning applications and associated application services as well as microlearning performances and scores or reviews of the same as the activities may be monitored distinctly by the microlearning purchase management module and the microlearning performance management module with the items thus generated being received by the modules and respectively. In some embodiments the activity monitoring module monitors activities of the each of a plurality of kinds of users on a plurality of kinds of user devices and at a plurality of kinds of associated learning facilities.

The notification interface generator is configured for retrieving the plurality of notification items for the viewing user from the notification items module and displays the retrieved notification items in a preferred chronology to the viewing user on a user device . In some embodiments the latest notifications of activities associated with the viewing user are requested to be generated and displayed dynamically by the viewing user. The notification interface generator generates and displays updated notification interface items at predetermined intervals of time to the viewing user on a user device by retrieving the same at predetermined intervals of time from module .

In this way the role based notification module generates notifications for activities performed in the modular learning system . The role based notification module associates each activity with particular user roles that may be granted access to the activity. User notifications are generated by validating a user s role and determining which activities the user s role grants the viewer access to.

Although the role based notification module is described as being composed of various modules fewer or more modules may be included in various embodiments while still falling within the scope of the invention.

At step when the role validation module validates the user and user role of the viewing user the notification items module retrieves purchase items performance items and other activities items for the user by accessing the purchase items module performance items module and activity items database . The items reflecting purchase of a learning application comprise an activity item for each unique purchase of at least one learning application The items reflecting performance of a learning application comprise an activity item for each unique performance of at least one learning application. At step the notification items module generates notification items for the viewing user based on items retrieved in the previous step and user role preferences for the viewing user s particular user role.

At step in embodiments wherein the viewing user s user role preferences are modified by the viewing user the notification items module updates and optionally edits the plurality of notification items based on the preferences. At step the notification interface generator retrieves the updated notification items from notification items module and displays the corresponding notification interface items in the preferred chronology through the preferred user role interface on the viewing user s user device .

Although the method for generating role based notifications in a modular learning system environment is described as being composed of various steps fewer or more steps e.g. Receiving Notification Items Display Preferences for Each Kind of Notification Item and each Kind of Corresponding User Role may comprise the method with the present invention still falling within the scope of various embodiments.

The modular learning system provides notifications for users based on various actions taken in the modular learning system. Examples of actions include purchase and performance evaluation of various learning applications. Other notifications may also be generated such as notifications of other actions such as change in availability for a learning facility availability of a new learning application by learning authors and other reflections of actions between users and the modular learning system. In particular these activities provide different notifications to different users whose profile matches or is a user consistent with the user update preferences depending upon their roles in the MLS. These user update preferences specify providing notifications to a user based on predetermined intervals. For example a learning facility changing its hours may provide notifications to tutors and learners who are using the learning facility space but not provide notifications to learning application template developers.

In additional embodiments notifications are generated for users for scheduling learning application performance. In addition to scheduling the modular learning system may use events to re schedule performance of a learning application if the original scheduling of a learning application performance is no longer possible or available. For example a user may schedule a learning application performance to learn a swimming stroke at a pool with a tutor. The tutor s schedule may change and prevent the tutor from providing tutoring services at the originally scheduled time. The modular learning system identifies compatible alternate times for the learning user to receive services by accessing availability information of the learning facility the tutor and the learning user to suggest an alternate schedule. The modular learning system may also use various data services to determine other impacts on performance of activities at a learning facility. For example the modular learning facility may identify when weather or an emergency will impact the learning performance. The learning performance metadata may include requirements for example that the learning application can only be performed on a day without rain. Using location information of the learning facility and the local weather forecast for example the modular learning system may automatically cancel a learning application performance scheduled on a day when there is rain and suggest scheduling for another day compatible with the weather metadata. The modular learning system may suggest for example a day in the next week that has a low predicted level of rain.
