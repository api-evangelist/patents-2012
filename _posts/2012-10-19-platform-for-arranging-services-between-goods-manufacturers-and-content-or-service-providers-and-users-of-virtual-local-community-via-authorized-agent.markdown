Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to social networking. More particularly embodiments of the invention relate to a platform for arranging goods manufacturers and service or different content providers with users of a virtual local community via authorized agents.

Social network services have been in existence for a number of years. Social network services typically consist of online communities of individuals who share similar background interests and or activities and are interested in meeting or interacting with other individuals in the network. Most social network services are Web based and provide a variety of ways for users to interact such as e mail instant messaging posting blogs and posting comments on each other s social network pages.

Conventional social networks lack of a platform to incorporate a social network environment to track users goods and service consumption based on geographical areas associated with the users.

Various embodiments and aspects of the inventions will be described with reference to details discussed below and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. However in certain instances well known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present inventions.

Reference in the specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in conjunction with the embodiment can be included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.

According to some embodiments a platform is provided for organizing interaction of users registered on the Web site with goods manufacturers and service or content providers in order to satisfy their social commercial information and other needs where the users are arranged based on their geographical areas which form one or more virtual local communities on the platform. In addition one or more databases are maintained to store personal consumption of goods services information and other types of content which may be indexed based on the associated geographical areas. Such databases can be consolidated into a collective or logical database of personal consumption of multiple Internet users.

The platform also allows one or more third party authorized agents to be associated with the users where an authorized agent AA is associated with a particular geographical area and represents users of that geographical area to interact with a goods service provider for example for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring goods or services directly from the goods service provider in a collective or aggregated manner. A user may get better prices for goods services avoiding resellers services via the associated authorized agent based on transactions with a goods service provider. The user may also be rewarded with ownership shares of the corresponding authorized agent based on the transactions or activities via the authorized agents and with dividends on the shares of the authorized agent owned by him. The term of goods service provider in general refers to any entity or person that provides goods service or content. A provider may be a manufacturer an importer exporter or a distributer. A provider may be a service provider providing a variety of services or a content provider providing a variety of content such as news.

According to some embodiments each user within the same geographical area is identified by a user identifier ID or username having a community identifier that uniquely identifies the corresponding geographical area. Similarly an authorized agent associated with a virtual local community is identified by an agent identifier that includes the associated community identifier that uniquely identifies the associated virtual community. As a result one can determine a geographical area of a user or authorized agent simply based on an ID of the user or the authorized agent. One can also search users or agents within a particular geographical area by searching the corresponding community identifier for example for determining the user activities e.g. purchasing patterns or trends of goods or services of a particular geographical area or contacting users in that geographical area or receive news and other information from a certain geographical area.

According to one embodiment users can register with platform to become members of a virtual local community. The registered users are managed by platform as residents based on the geographical areas in which the users actually reside forming different virtual local communities . In this example referring to users that reside in the same geographical area e.g. San Francisco are grouped as residents of virtual local community . According to one embodiment each of residents is identified by a user identifier ID having a community identifier that uniquely identifies the corresponding geographical area associated with virtual local community . The user identifier or resident identifier may be automatically assigned without user intervention to a user when the user registers with platform via registration system .

Platform also allows one or more third party authorized agents to be associated with residents or virtual local community . An authorized agent AA is associated with a particular geographical area and represents users of that geographical area to interact with a goods service provider for example for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring goods or services directly from goods service providers in a collective or aggregated manner. In this example authorized agents may be developed by third party entrepreneurs authorized by residents and installed within virtual local community . A resident may get a better price for goods services due to avoiding resellers when making a purchase via the associated authorized agent based on transactions with a goods service provider. For example an agent operates as a buyer s agent on behalf of residents and directly deals with a manufacturer of a particular kind of goods without a middleman such as a reseller in between. The agent may be able to obtain a contracted price for a group of residents from the manufacturer e.g. similar to a volume discount that is lower than the price obtained via a middleman such as a reseller. In return the agent may receive a reasonable commission based on the transaction. Meanwhile the residents receive a better price while the manufacturer is able to sell without having to advertising its goods or going through the middleman. Based on the revenue generated via the agent the share price of the ownership shares of the agent may increase. The resident may also be rewarded with ownership shares of the corresponding authorized agent based on the transactions or activities via the authorized agents.

Similar to residents each of authorized agents associated with virtual community is identified by an agent identifier that includes the associated community identifier that uniquely identifies virtual local community . As a result one can determine a geographical area of a user or authorized agent simply based on an ID of the user or the authorized agent. One can also search users or agents within a particular geographical area by searching the corresponding community identifier for example for determining the user activities e.g. purchasing patterns or trends of goods or services of a particular geographical area or contacting users in that geographical area. Although not shown other virtual local communities may be implemented in a similar structure or architecture.

According to one embodiment platform further includes a variety of systems or service modules to provide a variety of services to clients. Platform further includes search facility to allow a user e.g. resident or external non member users to search databases such as database associated with a virtual local community or to search residents or authorized agents within a virtual local community. Note that although the residents voluntarily provide goods or service consumption related information in database the information provided from database in response to a search request may be anonymous information without exposing identities or other sensitive information of the residents. For example names phone numbers or detailed addresses of the residents may not be exposed only the geographical area such as city or town of the residents may be provided in a search result. Analysis engine can be invoked to analyze the data such as user goods and service consumption patterns or trends which may be tracked or monitored by user activity monitor . For example one can utilize search facility and analysis engine to analyze and determine the goods and service consumption patterns or trends of a particular local community as residents within a virtual local community are organized based on their actual geographical areas in which the residents actually reside in the real world.

Platform further includes social networking service module to provide a variety of social networking services to the registered users. Social networking service module may include a web blogging service a social bookmarking service a photo sharing service and a news service. A blog service allows users to write personal and social commentary which may be presented to both users in the same community and the public at large. A social bookmarking service allows users to share a web link that the user thinks other users might find interesting. A photo sharing service allows users to share photos which have been uploaded to a data store not shown with other users and with public. A news service allows users to receive news or messages from other geographical areas by communicating with agents from those areas. Platform further includes communication service module to provide communication services to users of communities. Communication service module may provide a number of different communication services including for example an e mail service an instant messaging or chat service and a voice communication service. Other services may also be provided.

Databases can be analyzed via analysis engine for a variety of purposes. Databases may store current consumption anticipated consumption of the residents linked to the place of their actual residence to provide the residents and authorized agents also referred to as authorized companies with an opportunity to analyze what goods services and content people use in any geographical area or community of the world to find an authorized agent of a certain type goods services knowledge information etc. in the geographical area that a resident selects. An authorized agent can arrange interaction with residents living in the community the authorized agent is registered with.

According to one embodiment the residents of a community voluntarily provide their information for joint databases that are arranged according to local communities the residents live in. Every resident provides his her information anonymously. Inside databases the resident s international number is available to an authorized agent only to analyze demand in its goods services. During the analysis it is not possible to extract information entered by one of the residents on different goods items.

For example a resident from San Francisco wants to buy an unusual scarf that is not on sale in San Francisco. Using search facility the resident finds scarves of the quality he likes which are most popular among the residents of Paris. The resident from San Francisco enters in the search facility the community identifier for Paris the product e.g. scarf silk and other parameters. As a search result he receives a table specifying manufacturers figures on the scarves sales in Paris per each manufacturer e.g. a kind of a rating by sales volumes that looks like horizontal lines of different length . The sales figures are calculated by platform on the basis of purchases made by the residents living in Paris via the corresponding authorized agents and analysis of the products by analysis engine that were paid for from the accounts in the platform s credit union in Paris.

According to one embodiment activating on a manufacturer name a resident opens the list of the Paris authorized agents arranging purchases of scarves made by this manufacturer for the Paris residents. He can receive an advice on every manufacturer by contacting one of the Paris authorized agents using the communication services provided by communication service module . A click on the sales figure opens a list that shows miniature homes e.g. icons of the Paris agents. Any Resident can become an agent if he installs an agent option against the scarf image after he has bought this scarf via the corresponding authorized agent. The agent option means that a resident is ready to provide his her opinion on this scarf based on his personal impressions to anyone who needs it.

A San Francisco resident can also look through the agents opinions on a particular product. A San Francisco resident can also select the home of one of the agents the image of which he likes most and contact this Paris resident using communication service module to discuss the scarves he likes. The Paris agent receives a bonus from the authorized agent of San Francisco after the San Francisco resident makes his her purchase and gets a chance to extend the circle of his her friends among the residents from other areas of the world. He she has a chance to contact and talk to a resident from Paris who likes such scarves and who buys them.

In order to get access to the resources of platform a user has to register with platform via registration system . A user can access a user registration interface provided by registration system to register and create a user account. The user interface may be implemented in a variety of forms which may contain fields to receive at least the geographical area information in which the user actually resides. During the registration a user needs to enter information of his her home telephone number e.g. landline or his her residence address. In one embodiment a user has to enter at least the geographical are such as the city or town he she currently resides while the street or building numbers may be optional. Based on this information registration system automatically assigns a user identifier e.g. username to the user.

According to one embodiment a user identifier includes a location identifier or community identifier that uniquely identifies the corresponding geographical area in which a user actually resides. In one embodiment a user identifier includes one or more digits corresponding to the public telephone network number rules for international calls. A user identifier complies with recommendation and standard E.164 of the International Telecommunication Union ITU . In a particular embodiment a user identifier contains at least three groups of digits. The first group contains a country code the second group contains a numbering area code the so called ABC for the geographically based numbering area inside a country and the third group contains a unique number having the same amount of digits as fixed telephone numbers of the public telephone network in the country where a user actually resides. The third group of numbers is generated by registration system without user intervention. Each user is assigned with a unique user identifier that is unique amongst all registered users.

In addition each user is assigned with an email address under the platform s domain name. An email address of a user corresponds to the user identifier on the platform. Each user is further associated with a homepage for the user. The homepage address corresponds to the user identifier under the platform s domain name. A homepage of a user s web site and web pages linked to it are referred to as home where the homepage address may include a unique part of the corresponding user identifier. The platform is a stimulating method of entering information through a personal web page on consumption for concrete residents in a real city and a system for analyzing the information entered by the residents and authorized agents.

Further each user is associated with a credit union or a cooperative bank used for any transaction via the platform where the account number of the credit union cooperative bank may also be automatically assigned that contains certain unique part of the corresponding user identifier. The account number corresponds to the user s identifier e.g. login name . Registration on the platform constitutes the user s consent to become a shareholder where users of the credit union are co owners of the credit union. A credit union a cooperative bank is a member owned financial cooperative democratically controlled by its members and operated for the purpose of promoting thrift providing credit at competitive rates and providing other financial services to its members. Credit unions cooperative banks differ from commercial banks and other financial institutions in that the members who have accounts in the credit union are the owners of the credit union and they elect their board of directors in a democratic one person one vote system regardless of the amount of money on a user s account in the credit union cooperative bank. In one embodiment every owner of a credit union owns one share of the credit union. The value of the share is fixed and the same for every member of the credit union.

For example for a user living in Moscow a user identifier may be generated by registration system in a format of 7495XXXXXXX where 7 corresponds to a country code of Russia 495 corresponds to the area code of Moscow and XXX XXXX represents personal unique seven digit user number generated automatically by the platform s registration system which is compatible with a format of an international phone number. An email address of the same user may be assigned with 7495XXXXXXX platform s domain name . A homepage of the user may be assigned with www.7495XXXXXXX. Platform s domain name .coM or www. Platform s domain name .com 7495 XXXXXXX . An account number for the same user in the platform s credit union may be assigned with 7495XXXXXXX which is a part of the corresponding user identifier.

Similarly for a user living in San Francisco the user identifier will be 1415XXXXXXX where 1 corresponds to the country code of the U.S.A. 415 corresponds to the area code of San Francisco XXX XXXX represents a unique seven digit user number generated automatically by the platform s registration system. The email address will be 1415XXXXXXX Platform s domain name .com. The homepage address will be www.1415.XXXXXXX. Platform s domain name .com or www. Platform s domain name .com 1415 XXXXXXX . The account number in the Platform s Credit Union corresponding to the Login 1415XXXXXXX.

A legal entity registered on the platform is referred to as an authorized agent or authorized company. Natural persons and legal entities registered on the Platform together are referred to as users of the platform. The company which owns the legal rights in the platform is referred to as an administrator of the platform. Registration of legal entities on the platform is carried out by the following algorithm assignment of an agent identifier an e mail address a web site address a code including for instance four or more characters or symbols specifying the type of activity of the company in order to meet the requirement for the shareholding structure of the company being registered on the platform. Those companies can be registered on the platform the owners of a certain minimal number of shares of which are the residents or administrator of the platform. Requirements to the structure of shares of authorized agents are set by the administrator of the platform. The residents own the shares of the authorized agents for example through the ownership in the shares of the fund of the platform legally organized as a trust fund or in another form. The administrator of the platform and the credit union manage the fund of the platform. According to one embodiment up to 60 of every authorized company or agent are owned by multiple residents of the platform. The residents receive these 60 shares free of charge.

For example one of the possible variants of registration for a law firm from San Francisco company identifier 1415XXXXXXX where XXXXXXX is a unique company number generated automatically by the platform s registration system and corresponding to the company s office address email address 1415XXXXXXX. AAAA. Platform s domain name .com where AAAA the Platform s code for companies providing legal services homepage address www.1415XXXXXXX.AAAA. Platform s domain name .com and account number in the platform s Credit Union corresponding to the entity identifier 1415XXXXXXX 60 shares residents beneficiaries 10 shares the administrator of the platform beneficiary where percentage of the shares transferred to the residents is determined by the platform s administrator and depends on the type of business of the authorized agent or company. There can be another different from the above way of combining the identifier the company type code the domain name for writing the e mail address and the web site address and the shareholding structure of a company registered on the platform.

The difference of the platform s user registration system from the conventional systems on other Internet sites is that the registration system itself assigns a user identifier e.g. username for login purposes to every user according to the rules of assignment of the public telephone network numbers conforming to the recommendation of the International Telecommunication Union ITU . In one embodiment the platform s registration system does not use the existing cellular or landline telephone numbers of the users. The platform forms a database of numbers of its anonymous users and the corresponding homepages. The platform s database of the users numbers and the data of the users homepages together form publicly accessible databases. It means that any Internet user can perform a search of the homepages of the platform s residents living in a certain selected geographical area. The search result will be shown including miniatures e.g. thumbnails or icons of the residents homepages including their user identifiers.

Clicking on the miniature a user can open the resident s homepage to public that has the Home image. But further pages besides the homepage are not accessible for such a user. According to one embodiment the real name or photo of a resident is not shown on the home page. In one embodiment a homepage of a resident includes an image of a real house with a lawn which the resident believes to be an ideal place of living. This image is like a calling card of a resident. There is a mailbox standing next to the house and an advertising board for those who pass by. The first page is like a photo of a real house with adjacent territory. Most or some elements of this dream house are interactive. For example the entrance door is taken from a three dimensional 3D catalogue of a certain door manufacturer. All three dimensional 3D catalogues of items hosted on the platform in the form of databases are created using a technology for creating 3D images based on the photos of real objects. Any user can assess the resident s ideal house. If a user likes something in the house for example the entrance door by clicking on it the user can download a 3D model of this door into the library of 3D doors of his homepage. A click on the fa ade will display the images of fa ade painting options. Later the user will be able to use this 3D door to build its own house or to receive other 3D models of this manufacturer via an authorized agent.

In addition according to one embodiment authorized agents are associated with virtual local community . An authorized agent may be developed by a third party entity e.g. third party entrepreneur of that is different from a goods service provider. An authorized agent represents residents of a virtual community to collectively purchase or acquire goods or services from a goods service provider such as goods service providers . An authorized agent has to be authorized or approved by a majority of the residents of a virtual local community in order to be available within that virtual local community. For example at least 10 of the residents have to approve in order to allow an agent to operate or install within the community. Each authorized agent is associated with one or more providers of one type of goods service. An authorized agent can utilize the collective purchasing power to purchase or acquire goods or services for a better price on behalf of the residents. That is each item of goods ordered by an agent from a manufacturer has a concrete receiver who is a resident. A resident who utilizes an authorized agent gets goods at a manufacturer s price lower than the price obtained through middlemen such as resellers and may be rewarded with ownership shares of the authorized agent and dividends on the shares of an authorized agent owned by him as shown in .

Referring to buyer e.g. a resident can invoke authorized agent to reach goods service provider for example when the resident clicks on an item of its homepage. It is assumed that authorized agent has been approved and authorized by resident where authorized agent represents residents of a local community have a commercial relationship with goods service provider at a predetermined cost formula. In this example it is assumed that buyer pays via the associated account from its credit union set up within the community a total 75 to complete the transaction according to a predefined formula in which 65 is paid to goods service provider and 10 is paid to authorized agent . Since authorized agent brings business to goods service provider goods service provider rewards a kickback of 5 to authorized agent for administering databases of the goods provider . This amount is paid by all providers and is not connected to a certain purchase for provider it is a marketing expense. As a result authorized agent receives a profit of 5 assuming the cost for authorized agent is 10 . A portion of the profit is then allocated back to buyer according to a predetermined formula in this example 60 . In addition the cost of the ownership shares allocated to buyer is adjusted according to a predetermined formula .

Referring back to a resident s dream home is not just a beautiful picture. It is a model of a real house having certain dimensions designed by an architect. The model of a house for the homepage can be ordered from an architect or taken from the platform s catalogues similar to selecting a design from the catalogue of an architectural firm. By clicking on the homepage a user can get contacts of the project architect and contact him and order a design of a real house. The starting and the following pages of the home allow a resident to make a virtual tour around his ideal house. For example he can change furnishing and objects he can put clothes into the closet and open the fridge. All objects products are interactive 3D images of real products that he bought going to buy in reality via authorized agents. A resident can contact an authorized agent by clicking on the image of a real object in his ideal home.

For example a resident opens the bathroom page and clicks on an image e.g. 3D image of the toothpaste. This click connects the resident to an authorized agent which he used to make his last purchase and provides a list of alternative authorized agents. The resident may choose to re order his toothpaste through the last authorized agent or select a new authorized agent. Alternatively the resident opens a bathroom page and sees a blinking 3D image of the toothpaste meaning that the authorized agent has some new information for him on the toothpastes or other useful information. The resident may reject the proposal with a click or view the information on the new toothpastes. Viewing the information makes the resident s activity index stored in user activity database increased.

According to one embodiment every product service has an authorized agent associated to it in every virtual local community. By placing an image from the platform s catalogues in his ideal home a resident automatically establishes connection with the authorized agent in its community. Later the resident interacts with the authorized agent by clicking on the 3D images on the homepage. To open a homepage one has to enter the resident s identifier or username. External users can study and evaluate the images of homes on the residents homepages having zip codes of real cities around the world. The image of a home is like a resident s calling card. Information on the shareholding structure of the authorized agents is also included in the registration databases not shown . Using various methods or algorithms for processing the databases created on the platform different functions of social commercial information and other types are implemented.

A home interface e.g. home page is designed to create a personal database of a resident according to the platform s rules. A Home is opened when a browser of a resident is launched to access the platform. The homepage of the home can be viewed by the external users. According to one embodiment a home page interface includes some fields where a resident owning this Home can place such as for example a piece of his favorite song music or a movie a piece of news that is mostly interesting to him a limited number of logos of the companies he likes his favorite companies where the administrator of the Platform updates the types of companies from time to time his ideas proposals on new goods services that he would like to see on sale. It forms databases available for analysis of all the residents. For example one can find out what music or news is most popular today in San Francisco. On the platform any personal information of a resident is considered as information for anonymous databases available for analysis of the Residents themselves.

According to one embodiment there are one or more fields to place the above information on the main home page. Together they are called the home advertisement board. The home layout is a 3D model of an individual residential house. A resident can select the 3D model from the platform s catalogue or order an individual design. A resident can change the design of his home layouts appearance any time. All image elements are interactive and correspond to the manufacturers catalogues such as for example facades windows doors engineering equipment etc. For example a wallpaper image corresponds to real wallpaper from a catalogue of a wallpaper manufacturer. The information on the wallpaper that the residents choose is recorded in the platform s databases. The more interactive elements a resident places in the rooms of his home the better are the prices that resident can get in the future for example when the resident decides to change his wallpaper. In the home interface a resident has an opportunity to open a 3D model of a fridge and to put 3D food products on the shelves of the fridge. A click on every food product in the fridge will open a window with its parameters and will automatically send an order to the authorized agent for its purchase and an order to the credit union for the payment.

The home interface allows every resident to create its own databases containing information about its consumption and establish interactive connection with the manufacturers of goods services information and other content. A resident enters information in the form of visual images. A resident places objects that he has or that he would like to purchase in the future. A resident takes objects or services to be placed in his home from the platform s catalogues. The platform s databases of goods services are made of 3D models corresponding to articles of the manufacturers catalogues. According to one embodiment 3D models in the platform s catalogues are made using a technology for creating three dimensional images based on the photos of real objects. Databases of 3D goods services are administered and placed on the platform by the authorized agents or companies. In order to create a 3D model databases e.g. a three dimensional image created based on the photos of a real object the authorized agents use these manufacturers databases in the format of the platform s databases. The task of a resident is to place in his home the maximum number of objects or items and services that he uses and plans to purchase in the future. The objects or items resemble the actual goods the resident consumes in its actual home. The quantity of objects services and planned purchases placed in the home is taken into account for calculation of the resident s activity index.

A home interface allows residents to analyze in different ways the platform s databases formed by the residents without disclosing personal data of the residents. A home interface implements algorithms of different types related to purchases of goods service as well as to the social interaction of residents. Users not registered on the platform can view the main homepages only and they can also sort the homes by the geographical areas they are registered in. Residents can provide the access to other pages of their home pages by issuing individual guest passwords. A home contains a package of interfaces implementing different telecommunication functions audio video telephone chat email web mailing and other. All types of communications are carried out via the home interface without limitations except for sending emails from an external user not registered on the Platform to a resident. To send such an email an external according to one embodiment an external user must get a temporary automatic registration on the platform for a limited period of time.

According to one embodiment a homepage contains an interface allowing a resident to make queries for analysis of the platform s databases e.g. search facility of . The search system algorithms are based on selecting the key parameters related to the location of the web site owner or the content source. For conventional search systems the main parameters are query processing speed volume of the indexed information geographical location of the query source language the information is written in. The main difference of the platform s search system is that it processes the databases structured according to the platform s rules only.

In one embodiment the search system interface includes four types of fields. Field type 1 is designed for entering the following types of information that will limit the data selection location of the owners of the web pages a country a group of countries a city a group of cities login name of the platform user the company type the unique company name. Field type 2 is designed for entering the key words in free format. Field type 3 is designed for entering the rating parameter of the web pages participating in the selection. The web pages rating can be set up using the following parameters favorite web sites that are viewed most often favorite web sites that most users liked popularity coefficient e.g. the percent of users who assessed the web pages in the positive from the total quantity of users who viewed the page negative assessment coefficient e.g. the percent of users who assessed the web pages in the negative from the total quantity of users who viewed the page. When a resident generates a search query the resident may enter several parameters in any combination to place the web pages he found in the parameter ascending or descending order.

According to one embodiment a resident assesses or rank a web site when he closes the page. One of the options of closing a page is to use one of three assessment buttons on the page tab of the platform s page. A first button corresponds to positive assessment. A second button represents negative assessment. A third button represents neutral assessment. The number of assessments of the closed pages is included into the resident s activity index. The administrator of the platform determines the algorithm for its calculation. The resident s activity index is taken into consideration for calculating the number of shares of the authorized companies owned by the resident. This method of closing browser pages is noted on the platform as user evaluation of the web site open on the web site page. Field type 4 is designed for processing the platform s goods services knowledge databases. It allows a resident to receive analytical information such as product popularity by cities groups of cities rating assessment of a product by the residents comparative information on similar products and to find authorized companies representing the product of interest in different geographical areas.

Referring back to in this example it is assumed that homepage has been configured by resident to associate authorized agents with certain graphical representations representing the items or goods displayed as part of homepage. When a user either resident itself or an external user activates a graphical representation e.g. graphical representation an authorized agent e.g. authorized agent associated with the activated graphical representation is invoked which links the user to one or more goods service providers e.g. goods service providers in this example . The user can examine inquire and purchase goods or services from the associated goods service providers via the corresponding authorized agent.

When an authorized agent registers with the platform to be associated with a particular community he gets an opportunity to arrange a deal to purchase particular goods or services from a particular goods service provider if the residents agree to authorize the authorized agent to be part of the platform. The authorized agent utilizes the collective bargaining power of multiple residents to achieve a mutually beneficial business relationship between the authorized agent and the manufacturers. A resident who utilizes the authorized agent may get a better price without having to pay the middlemen such as resellers when making a purchase. Payment of the purchase may be drawn from the residents credit union accounts and paid to the associated authorized agent. The authorized agent in turn pays the manufacturer. In addition the ownership shares of the authorized agent of the resident may also be adjusted as shown in .

The platform is aimed to collect information to the benefit of the residents themselves including creating and updating the database of residents individual consumption of goods services analysis of databases of consumption of all users registered on the platform analysis of news and knowledge databases as well as other types of databases created by the users analysis of databases of goods services of all manufacturers registered on the platform exchange of information between the registered users and registered manufacturers of goods services purchases from the manufacturers of goods services organization of financial transactions of the users selection of the type of his her personal commercial activity and organization of this activity deriving revenues from using Internet resources without carrying out commercial operations and creating investment value of the home of a resident.

According to one embodiment multiple residents of a community receive free of charge some or most of the shares of the authorized agents the services of which they use. Every user has a share in the stock yield of the authorized agents. This share has a fixed part and a variable part depending on the activity index of a resident on the platform. Thus after the registration on the platform a resident automatically becomes collective co owner of the authorized agent s shares. A resident may partially sell the share of his home in the stock yield of an authorized agent to an investor.

The platform is designed to infinitely expand the functionalities available on the platform via authorized agents or companies. The platform is able to integrate computer software designed by independent software developers e.g. third party entrepreneurs of implementing different algorithms of interaction between the platform s users living in one or several geographical areas and manufacturers of goods services information knowledge and other types of content as well as between the platform s users themselves. Such software depicts the algorithms of interaction between the platform s databases consumer databases created by the residents and databases of the manufacturers of goods services information knowledge and other types of content.

According to one embodiment an authorized agent owns the title in the algorithm designed. The developer of the algorithms owns the title in a certain number of shares of the authorized agent implementing this algorithm as a paid service on the platform. In order to organize the authorized agent s business the developer of the algorithm may use his shares to attract partners or investors. A standard seller approaches a manufacturer with an offer to sell their produce. An authorized agent appointed by the residents approaches a manufacturer as a representative of a certain part of the population of one of the geographical areas. An authorized agent that got a certain rating at year end among the platform s users as per the quality of its services and financial performance in its community is able to get access to doing business through the platform in other geographical area of the world.

Before being integrated into the platform according to one embodiment every algorithm has to be certified approved by the residents living in the same settlement whose databases are to be available for processing by this algorithm. For example a businessman intends to organize a purchase of irons for the residents of a certain district of San Francisco. He has a proposal for the residents of this district on how to do it in the most beneficial and comfortable way for them. He goes to the platform s administrator of this district with this proposal. The administrator sends the proposal to the residents. If the businessman s proposal receives a positive response from the residents the businessman will register an authorized agent on the platform. The way of purchasing the irons will be formalized on the platform as a computer program and an authorized agent web site.

In order to buy an iron the residents of this district of San Francisco will need to click on the image of an iron on the housekeeping area page of the home. Such a click will establish a connection with the specialized authorized agent dealing with irons. The authorized agent according to its algorithm will render assistance in selecting the optimal model for the resident s . Afterwards the authorized agent sends the collective order for the purchase of irons from the residents of this district of San Francisco to the manufacturer. In 3 5 days the manufacturer ships irons directly to the end customers in San Francisco. In this example the authorized agent arranges an interaction between the iron demand databases formed by the residents of one of San Francisco districts and manufacturers databases of iron. Note that the manufacturers are not part of the platform. Manufacturers are interested in selling their products to the residents should create 3D electronic catalogues of their products in the platform s format. A manufacturer provides its product database to be included into the platform databases. The platform s 3D databases are indexed by the authorized agents selling corresponding products.

Alternatively an authorized agent can initiate a creation of a 3D image database by a manufacturer to be included into the platform databases. It is assumed that there are ten authorized agents specialized in irons in San Francisco. For a manufacturer of irons these ten authorized agents represent a collective buyer representing the most part of San Francisco population. There are 300 authorized agents specialized in irons in 300 cities that provide for the demand for irons of the most part of the US population. The platform offers an opportunity to make purchases directly from the manufacturer using the services of the authorized agents in every city. At the year end every authorized agent receives its rating from the residents of the real city it operates in. If the rating is lower than a predetermined threshold the authorized agent may be removed from the platform. This helps maintain the quality level in every city. An authorized agent places on the platform databases of a manufacturer of goods services information and knowledge according to the rules of the Platform and using its algorithm administers their interaction with the residents databases.

Evolutionary development of the algorithms functioning on the platform takes place on the basis of the principles of competitiveness. Every type of service is being implemented using several algorithms belonging to different authorized agents. The authorized agents act on behalf of the buyers. An authorized agent gets a chance to operate on the platform in the event it gets permission from the buyers. Based on its rating a certain authorized agent can be removed from the platform. The platform performs for the residents the function of rating evaluation of the authorized company at year end. For example authorized agents may receive ratings based on a number of factors the number of residents they provided services to earnings per share share value dynamics at year end. The authorized agents with the lowest ratings lose the status of an authorized agent. Integration of the software implementing different algorithms may be carried out on a paid fee basis. An authorized agent makes regular payments to the administrator of the platform for placing its databases on the platform.

According to one embodiment the administrator of the platform may define certain types of the platform s services as the exclusive services. Methods or algorithms of the exclusive services can belong only to the authorized agents whose shares are owned only by the residents and the administrator of the platform. Such authorized agents are hereinafter referred to as the exclusives authorized agents. The difference between a regular authorized agent and an exclusive authorized agent is in the types of activities and in the form of share distribution. In one embodiment the platform s administrator determines the types of activities for the exclusive authorized agents. Such activities for the most part are not associated with the specific character of a certain geographical area. They may be free for the residents or these activities should be the same for all residents. Shares of an exclusive authorized agent can be owned only by the residents and administrator. Shares of a regular authorized agent can be owned by the residents administrator and creator or investor of the regular authorized agent. The administrator of the platform determines how the shares of the exclusive authorized agents will be distributed among the residents and the administrator of the platform. For example when the administrator registers an exclusive authorized agent it may transfer 60 shares to the platform s trust fund for free. The beneficiary of the trust fund is the credit union of the platform. As per its legal form the credit union is owned by the multiple residents. Thus the ultimate beneficiaries of the exclusive authorized agent are the administrator and the multiple residents.

The exclusive services provided on the platform via the exclusive authorized agents include for example financial advertising telecommunication insurance post and other services. The shareholding structure in an exclusive authorized agent can look as follows in one of the instances residents 60 shares the administrator of the platform 40 shares. Note that on the platform the sales revenues are not being distributed between the platform and an authorized agent. The residents and the platform own only the shares of an authorized agent. In order to implement their algorithms on the platform the exclusive authorized agents use the software designed by independent software developers with an open source code or API.

For example an exclusive financial company e.g. the credit union owns 60 shares of a payment system and a credit broker. These two entities or companies are part of the credit union group and belong to the exclusive financial company type. The payment system performs settlement functions when the residents make their purchases. The credit broker acts to the benefit of a resident having an account in the credit union. It renders services related to provision of credits by one resident to the other. The credit broker formalizes relations between them for example determining the maximum possible interest rate and other parameters. A borrower and a lender get a chance to determine or to change the credit terms and conditions at their own discretion using the credit union s tools.

An exclusive financial company belonging to the group of companies of the platform s credit union implements financial algorithms on the platform. Assets of the credit union are mainly used to provide financing to the residents via services of the exclusive financial company to enable them to make purchases generally from the authorized companies. The exclusive financial company implements the algorithms of payment for purchases and direct crediting algorithms. The direct crediting algorithm allows for direct interaction between a resident lender and a resident borrower via the exclusive financial company. The exclusive financial company determines the limits of possible amendment of terms and conditions of the provided loan which a lender and a borrower may change during the loan repayment term.

Another example of an exclusive authorized agent is an exclusive telephone company which has the same functions as any other Internet call service . Its shares belong only to the residents and the administrator. A particular feature of the exclusive telephone company interface includes the rules of showing the information when establishing releasing a connection. An exclusive telephone company is a free service for the residents when they are telecommunicating via the Internet. The interface of this service is integrated in the home s interface. When the connection is established every person who participates in the conversation sees the image of the home of the person he she is talking to. When the connection is released every resident sees the favorite company of the person he is talking to included in his homepage.

Another example of an exclusive authorized agent is an exclusive post company e.g. the platform s mail software allows sending messages between the residents as well as between the residents and the Internet users not registered on the platform . Other mail programs usually allow creating different groupings based on a limited number of parameters sender s name send receive date time subject and priority. The platform provides an opportunity to deeper differentiate the messages using the platform s registration parameters. An important property of the platform s mail program is that it registers on the platform all advertising marketing messages received and viewed by the resident.

For example the mail program automatically distributes all incoming messages into three types from individuals from companies advertising marketing. Incoming mail is grouped according to the city the sender lives in. For example a mail web page interface has three columns corresponding to three types of messages individuals companies and advertising marketing. In the column grouping together messages from the individuals names of the cities with the number of unread messages are shown vertically. A click on the column name opens messages as a list. A click on the city name opens the list of messages from this city. Advertising marketing column allows subscribing for information on a certain goods category from an authorized agent. The number of subscriptions and views of information received by a resident in this mail box is registered to determine the resident s activity index which in its turn influences the resident s share in the stock yield of the authorized agent.

An exclusive post company is a free service for the residents. The service interface is integrated in the homepages of residents. The resident s mailbox distributes the incoming correspondence in different smart boxes depending on the type of the incoming mail. The incoming letters are sorted by the city where the sender lives by the type of the sender a resident or an authorized agent by the information type advertisement marketing. Every letter type has its own smart mailbox. Operation algorithm of the exclusive post company allows attaching a postage stamp to an email. A postage stamp is a logo of a favorite company of the email sender and a two dimensional 2D barcode containing information about the favorite company. Opening of the QR code is registered by the platform s mail program as the evidence confirming that the information was reviewed that increases the resident s activity index. Opening of the postage stamp barcode raises the sender s and the receiver s ratings on the platform.

Another example of an exclusive authorized agent is an exclusive advertising company that implements algorithms related to distribution of the advertising marketing and expert opinion information. Such information is being sent if a resident subscribes for a certain type of information. Subscription operates via the home interface by means of 3D images of goods services or by setting the advertising smart mailbox. Note that the subscription operates from a web site located on the platform by means of the platform s mail software instead of from an external web site. The main difference of the platform subscription is that reviewing the information received in such a way brings dividends on the resident s shares of the exclusive advertising marketing company.

The dividend depends on the number of subscriptions and the information reviewed. The exclusive advertising marketing company distributes content among the residents pursuant to a contract with an advertiser. For the information viewed a resident receives benefits from the exclusive advertising marketing company and dividends on its shares. Subscription can have different categories advertisement news or expert information. A resident can change settings for the information by the type of goods services by manufacturer by the city the information is aimed for and by other parameters. The information received under subscription is announced in the marketing information news line. A resident specifies the goal of subscription a hobby or an intended purchase. The news line in the resident s home is shown as running letters or in another dynamic way. The resident can assess the information block by selecting positive negative or neutral options or provide written comments. The number of subscriptions for information the number of the information blocks and comments on them are displayed on the activity of the resident page and are used to set the rating of the home of the administrator of the platform.

According to one embodiment a resident can fill in an advertisement board field dedicated to his favorite company. In this case advertisement of the favorite company will be dynamically updated by the algorithms of the exclusive advertising company. During the search queries related to the sorting of homes the results will show the image of the home s homepage and the field of the resident s favorite company from the advertisement board.

According to one embodiment any resident can register as an agent of an exclusive advertising company. Such a registration of a resident may raise the rating of his home. After the registration as an agent a resident may gain access to an analysis of the page views of the advertisement received from him by other residents. In the platform s databases the registered agents will be shown as residents ready to provide their comments on a certain type of goods and their rating according to the residents assessment. An authorized agent pays an advertisement agent a fee or reward after a purchase made with his participation.

In one embodiment an exclusive advertising company implements algorithms of creation of expert communities based on different types of goods services and on the basis of such communities forms open knowledge databases similar to the wiki websites. The platform s means are oriented at first creation by authorized agents of the expert opinion based on the residents opinions second customer influence on the quality of goods services. The goal of the authorized agents is to represent the collective interests by putting together objective information on a provider or services goods in a comfortable way and with maximum details. For example an authorized agent s information on the coffee shops in San Diego residents of district . . . prefer coffee shop XXX 70 visitors give it the highest score particular feature a special coffee grade AAA with the taste of . . . You will be lucky is John makes your cup of coffee. This week he works on Mon Tue Wed. after 4 p.m. Bear in mind that on Friday after 5 p.m. it is difficult to find a place there. And a lot of other extra information based on the customers reviews. You can send a message to John or call Bill from the AC. He will advise where it is better to have a cup of coffee at this time.

In another example an authorized agent specialized in laundry services in San Diego based on the residents reviews can discuss with the management of the company providing laundry services on behalf of the residents how to improve their relations with the customers including proposals on substitution of inattentive employees. If the management of the company does not take any action on improving the quality of their services the authorized agent can advise the residents to use services of another company more attentive to their customers.

An exclusive advertising company pays from its own revenues for the services of the authorized information companies which are mass media. The amount of financing received by each authorized information company depends on its rating calculated on the basis the residents assessments and number of subscribers.

According to another embodiment registration of a resident on the platform is carried out by means of freeware distribution of free advertisement management software also referred to as content management software by the platform s administrator among the Internet users. The software represents a supplement or plug in to a variety of browser applications such as Mozilla s Firefox Google s Chrome Apple s Safari Microsoft s Internet Explorer etc. This type of browser software supplements may be distributed via a Web site of the browser owner. Advertisement management software may be distributed under an open source and free software license.

When downloading the advertisement management software the downloading software redirects a user to the platform s registration Web page. Registration Web page interface allows a user to register as a co owner of an exclusive advertisement company and as a resident of the platform. Supplementary advertisement management software for browsers such as browser blocking advertisement on web sites is most popular among users. For example Mozilla s Firefox advertisement blocking supplement has 100 000 downloads per day on the average. Taking into account the fact that the market share of this browser is around 20 the potential audience of the advertisement management software is around 300 000 downloads per day or around 100 million per year. According to one embodiment the advertisement management software supplement includes the following major functions 

Using settings in the home interface a resident can specify the type of goods services he is currently interested in receiving information on in the form of banners from advertisers. Depending on the resident s settings the information in the form of banners may be downloaded by the advertisement management software into the memory of the resident s computer at a user configurable schedule e.g. every hour in the background. Using settings in the home advertising marketing mailbox a resident can specify the volume of the information in Mbytes he she receives. When the amount of information exceeds this predetermined volume the new information will replace the old information.

According to one embodiment the advertisement management software allows a user to view the downloaded banners in a browser window online or offline. When viewing the banners online according to one embodiment part of the browser window in the form of a view bar to the left or to the right hereinafter referred to herein as a view bar is used to show the banners. The banners may be displayed in a stack one above another as a vertical bar or in another way. When a user opens a new browser session or tab banners in the view bar are updated. Information concerning the total number of banners downloaded into the memory of a PC an Internet access device the number of banners viewed and various activity statistical data of a resident on utilization of the advertisement management software are shown in the view bar. When viewing the banners offline the view bar fills the entire browser window. In this viewing mode the banners are placed one above the other in several vertical bars. The price of a click paid by the advertiser and other parameters may be shown on every banner.

Management by users of the interactive banners implies that the downloaded banners have certain interactive properties and a unique number. With a click on a banner in the view bar a user can delete it from the memory lay aside to view later go to the advertiser s website e.g. Web site send the banner to another user write his request opinion for the advertiser specify the price at which he is ready to buy the goods services advertised on the banner and other functional opportunities.

According to one embodiment a banner includes a front side e.g. first page and or a back side e.g. second page . A resident can open the front or back side of a banner with a click. The front side of a banner includes advertising information on it. The back side of a banner is dedicated to additional or detailed information of an advertiser and to users requests opinions with regard to the front side of the banner. Users requests opinions written on the back side of a banner are collected by an exclusive advertisement company and forwarded via specialized authorized companies to advertisers. A resident can personalize a banner he received. This advertisement management software function assigns user s login on the platform to the banner downloaded into the memory of a user s computer. A user can send the personalized banner to another user.

Utilizing the opportunity to place information on the back side of a banner banners allow arranging different game configurations for users that are financed by the advertisers. Examples of the game configurations are as follows 

Different game configurations may be developed by independent developers and placed on the Web page of the exclusive advertisement company on the platform. Advertisers have an opportunity to choose one of the game algorithms for their advertising campaign. Viewing assessing and other actions of a resident associated with processing the banners downloaded to his her computer are forwarded by the advertisement management software in the background mode via the home website to the databases of the platform s administrator.

Activity of a resident in using the advertisement management software is taken into account for the calculation of the resident s activity index. A resident s income from the ownership shares of an exclusive advertisement company has a fixed component and a variable component which depend on the resident s activity index. An exclusive advertisement company derives income from providing advertisers with services on distribution of targeted advertising among the residents.

Advertisement management software differs radically from other software existing on the market such as for example AdBlock Adblock Plus etc. as they only block the advertisements when viewing websites. Uniqueness of the advertisement management software is that besides blocking the advertisements on the websites it creates a personal interactive channel allowing users to manage their interaction with advertisers by themselves.

A resident s asset is its home. According to one embodiment it has an investment value which is defined by the cost of shares of the authorized exclusive companies owned by the resident. The resident owns the stocks shares of the authorized exclusive companies through the ownership in the shares of the platform s fund. The number of stocks shares owned by the resident depends on the resident s activity index which is dynamically depicted in the home interface. Multiple residents may receive rights in the most part of the shares of all authorized agents free of charge. The shares owned by a resident are divided into ordinary and special ones dividends on which depend on the activity index. The investment value of a home is the value of the package of shares of the authorized agents owned by a resident. This figure is calculated on a regular basis and is fixed at the year end. The algorithm for calculation of a resident s activity index is determined by the administrator of the platform.

According to one embodiment the following parameters can be used for calculation money turnover on the platform s credit union account during purchases of goods services from the authorized agents money turnover on the platform s credit union account during purchases of goods services from the companies not registered on the platform. Such a turnover is taken into consideration with reduction factor e.g. 0.5 activity of user interactions on the assessments of the web sites viewed when using the platform s searching engine activity of a resident when using services of the exclusive agents completeness and trustworthiness of information in the home s databases about goods services that a resident uses in real life and about purchases he plans to make an activity when placing advertisement on the advertisement board ideas proposals on the new services to create the authorized companies and the number of subscriptions for advertising on a certain type of goods services information and activity of viewing.

According to one embodiment a resident receives a right in the shares of an authorized exclusive agent on condition that he uses the services of the agents of this type minimum once or a certain number of times . A resident has a right to sell a certain percent of shares of an authorized exclusive agent linked to its home in a certain period of time through the platform s credit union only for example in 3 years up to 10 shares in 5 years up to 20 shares in 10 years up to 50 shares. The cost of shares of the authorized exclusive agents is determined by the international stock market.

In order to register shares of authorized exclusive companies a resident has to be a member of the platform s credit union and maintain minimal financial activity. Minimal financial activity means that during a year a resident made purchases from authorized exclusive companies for example amounting to 1 000 or the minimum balance on his account in the platform s credit union amounted for example to 1 000. The sum of minimal financial activity depends on the geographical area where the resident resides. After the registration a resident receives a package of actions of the authorized companies for free. When the number of such companies grows the package of actions having a real value grows correspondingly. The activity index is aimed at avoidance of misuse on the part of the users who register on the platform to get actions but do not use the platform s services.

In order to coordinate the residents living in a community according to one embodiment the administrator of the platform organizes election of two platform s administrators from the residents living in that community using an election algorithm. One platform s administrator is hereinafter referred to as the mayor the other the treasurer.

The mayor and the treasurer are elected by rating voting of the residents of the community. The mayor and the treasurer may be paid positions of the platform s administrator employees in a community. The administrator is interested in improvement and creation of new services taking into account the specificity of every community. Such a method of appointment enhances the significance of the platform as a method for representation of interests of the residents living in the same community. The mayor s responsibilities include development of social interaction of the residents and satisfaction of their current demands using the platform s means. The main result of the mayor s administration can be represented by the growing number of authorized companies and residents. The mayor also extends experience of the authorized companies from other communities in his home community invites the companies in the community to work on the platform develops the advertisement board function integrates algorithms of social communication and interaction into the platform. In big communities there can be several mayors one per each administrative district. The treasurer s responsibilities include development of services of an exclusive financial company taking into consideration the residents initiatives as well as the authorized companies in his community. The treasurer is the head of the exclusive financial company that depends on the number of the platform s services realized by the authorized companies.
